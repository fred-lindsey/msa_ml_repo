Tim Cook

Thanks, Tejas.

 

Good afternoon, everyone.

Today, Apple is reporting a very strong quarter with double digit revenue growth across our product and services categories, and in every geographic segment.

 

We set a new June quarter revenue record of $81.4 billion, up 36% from last year, and the vast majority of markets we tracked grew double digits, with especially strong growth in emerging markets including India, Latin America, and Vietnam.

Total retail sales also set a June quarter record, and almost all of our retail stores have now opened their doors.

 

This quarter saw a growing sense of optimism from consumers in the United States and around the world, driving renewed hope for a better future and for all that innovation can make possible.

But as the last 18-months had demonstrated many times before, progress made is not progress guaranteed.

 

An uneven recovery to the pandemic and a Delta variant surging in many countries around the world have shown us once again, that the road to recovery will be a winding one.

In the midst of that enduring adversity, we are especially humbled that our technology has continued to play a key role in keeping our customers connected.

 

Just last month, it was great to be back with our teams and customers for the opening of our newest retail store in Los Angeles, our Apple Tower Theater.

It was a hopeful reminder of the energy and sense of community, shared spaces bring and how appreciative we all are now of the simple privilege of talking to one another face to face.

 

As we look forward to more in-person interactions in the future, we're doubling down on innovation, and doing all we can to help chart a course to a healthier and more equitable world.

I'll have more to say about our work in those areas a bit later on.

 

But first, let's turn to our product and services categories.

For iPhone, this quarter saw very strong double digit growth in each geographic segment, and we continue to be heartened by our customer's response to the iPhone 12 lineup.

 

We're only in the early innings of 5G, but already its incredible performance and speed have made a significant impact on how people can get the most out of our technology.

Customers love iPhone 12 for its superfast 5G speeds, A14 Bionic chip and Adobe vision camera never seen before in a phone.

 

Users continue to rely on iPad and Mac to work, learn, create and connect.

iPad had its highest June quarter in nearly a decade, while Mac set an all-time June quarter record.

 

We've seen a great response to the new iMac and iPad Pro, both powered by the M1 chips exceptional speed and power efficient performance.

The iMac’s remarkable thin design and vibrant colors have made it a favorite for users everywhere.

 

And the iPad continues to be an incredibly versatile tool in our user's toolbox, inspiring creativity and connection and keeping us entertained and productive in equal measure.

It was another very strong quarter for wearables, home and accessories, which set a new June quarter record, while helping people find more ways to stay entertained, healthy and connected at home and on the go.

 

Apple Watch remains a go to choice for users to stay on top of their health and reach their fitness goals.

And our newest accessory AirTag began shipping to an enthusiastic response from customers, making the find my network more useful than ever, while protecting user privacy.

 

Turning to services, which set a new all-time revenue record as we continue to roll out innovative new features and programming.

We're proud to be the recipients of 35 Emmy Nominations this year, which speaks to the quality of our programming, and an enthusiastic reception from customers and critics alike.

 

Apple TV+ users are loving series like Mythic Quest, and anticipating groundbreaking films like Coda, which premieres next month.

And of course, Ted Lasso kicked off season two just last week, and continues to win over viewers with its heartwarming message about the power of community, compassion and hope.

 

We also introduced Apple Podcast subscriptions, a global marketplace for users to discover exclusive content and support their favorite creators.

And we launched spatial audio for Apple Music, a cinematic listening experience that promises to change how music fans listen, and musicians create even more immersive, layered, and beautiful songs.

 

Last month, we shared many exciting new features at WWDC.

But more powerful than any of them was the incredible showing of developers from all walks of life and around the world.

 

The new tools we announced will help developers harness cutting edge technologies, like augmented reality, reach new users and customize their experience on the App Store, or learn to update or invent an app with Swift, Apple's powerful and intuitive programming language.

Today's investments in education and coding translate to tomorrow's small businesses and groundbreaking new apps.

 

The next act of an app economy, already creating jobs and opportunity around the world.

In June, a new study by the analysis group found that it was another record year for App Store developers, whose combined billings and sales increased by 24% to $643 billion in 2020.

 

The app economy continues to be an incredible engine of prosperity and opportunity, fueled by the ceaseless striving for developers to make apps that enrich people's lives.

Much like the developer community, we are diehard optimist, about technology's potential to help people live happier, healthier and more fulfilled lives, goals that shine through with powerful new updates coming to iOS, iPad OS, Mac OS, and Watch OS this fall.

 

That begins with innovative new features that help users stay connected with one another, like share play and spatial audio for FaceTime, or disconnect when they need a break like focus, which limits distracting notifications when you're winding down for bed or concentrating at work.

And new productivity features make iPad an even more useful tool for multitasking, helping users navigate across apps, split their screen or use quick note to capture a thought the moment inspiration strikes.

 

In the health space, our new health sharing feature will make it easier than ever to securely share your health data to share your health data with loved ones.

That includes new capabilities like walking steadiness, which uses sensors to assess user stability doing everyday tasks, and recommends exercises to improve stability and avoid a fall.

 

In the belief that privacy is a fundamental human right, we share new features in iOS 15 that continue to drive our progress forward, from mail privacy protection, which stops invisible pixels and an email from tracking your mail activity to App Privacy Report, which helps users check on the apps they've granted permission to use their personal data.

We also introduced some incredible next generation technologies coming to the accessibility space.

 

From assistive touch, which helps people with limb differences navigate Apple Watch to new voiceover capabilities to help blind and low vision users, accessibility remains a bedrock principle for us, in the simple belief that the best technology for the world should be the best technology for everyone.

But the responsibility to be a force for good in the lives of others extends beyond the technology we made, so the teachers and students shaping our future.

 

This quarter as part of our racial equity and justice initiative, we awarded innovation grants to engineering schools at four historically black colleges and universities to expand their coursework, scholarships and internship opportunities in hardware engineering and silicon chip design.

We see education as a great equalizing force, and we're more dedicated than ever to supporting the educators, advocates and students lining the path and leading the way.

 

That includes the 350 swift student challenge winners, we recognized at this year's WWDC.

If you ever need a dose of hope or inspiration, I can't say enough about our students' scholarship winners, whose apps bring so much good into the world, from teaching other young people to code to helping volunteers deliver groceries to people at high risk of COVID-19.

 

Young people's innovations remind us that our collective future is bound up in the next generations' passion for solving global challenges, and of the responsibility we have to join them in building a better world.

Turning to our own backyard, we're continuing to press forward in our efforts to help bring more affordable housing to the Bay Area and across California.

 

This month, we shared that we've contributed more than $1 billion to help first time homeowners and construct 1000s of new affordable housing units across the state.

And we're continuing to stay focused on supporting the global response to the pandemic and delivering the best products and services for people.

 

Our greatest source of inspiration is a technology itself, but how people use it in their own lives, in ways great and small, to write a novel or to read one, to care for an ailing patient or see a doctor virtually, to track their heart rate on a jog or to train for the Olympics.

Every day, I'm grateful for the dedication of our teams to the simple mission of creating technology that improves people's lives.

 

And I want to thank everyone at Apple for the purpose and passion they bring to that mission.

With that, I'll hand it over to Luca for a deeper dive on our performance this quarter.

 



Luca Maestri

Thank you, Tim.

 

Good afternoon, everyone.

We're very pleased to report record June quarter financial results, which reflect the importance of our products and services in our customers lives and our strong underlying operating performance.

 

Our revenue reached a June quarter record of $81.4 billion, an increase of nearly $22 billion or 36% from a year ago.

We grew double digits in each of our product categories, with an all-time record for services, and June quarter records for iPhone, Mac, and Wearables, Home and Accessories.

 

We also set new June quarter records in every geographic segment with very strong double digit growth in each one of them.

Products revenue was a June quarter record of $63.9 billion, up 37% over a year ago.

 

This level of sales performance, combined with the unmatched loyalty of our customers drove our installed base of active devices to a new all-time record.

Our services set an all-time revenue record of $17.5 billion up 33% over a year ago, with June quarter records in each geographic segment.

 

Company gross margin was 43.3%, up 80 basis points from last quarter driven by cost savings and a higher mix of services, partially offset by seasonal loss of leverage.

Products gross margin was 36% down 10 basis points sequentially, a seasonal loss of leverage was almost entirely offset by cost savings.

 

Services gross margin was 69.8% down 30 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix.

Net income of $21.7 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.30, and operating cash flow of $21.1 billion were all June quarter records by a wide margin.

 

Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories.

iPhone revenue set a June quarter record of $39.6 billion growing 50% year-over-year and exceeding our own expectations, as the iPhone 12 family continued to be in very high demand.

 

Performance was consistently strong across the world, and we grew very strong double digits in each geographic segment, setting June quarter records in most markets we track.

Our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high, thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and the strength of our ecosystem.

 

In the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 97% for the iPhone 12 family.

Turning to services, as I mentioned, we reach an all-time revenue record of $17.5 billion with all-time records for cloud services, music, video, advertising and payment services, and June quarter records for the App Store and Apple Care.

 

Our newest service offerings Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple card, Apple Fitness+ as well as the Apple One bundle, continue to scale across users, content and features and are contributing to overall services growth.

The key drivers for our services business all continue to move in the right direction.

 

First, our installed base of devices reached an all-time high across each geographic segment.

Second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the June quarter in each geographic segment, and paid accounts increased double digits.

 

Third, paid subscriptions continue to show strong growth.

We now have more than 700 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 150 million from last year, and nearly four times the number of paid subscriptions we had only four years ago.

 

And finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love, while also continuing to improve the breadth and quality of our current services offerings.

For example, during WWDC in June, we previewed our new iCloud+, and Apple Wallet features, which we believe will create a more secure and differentiated customer experience.

 

Wearables, home and accessories grew 36% year-over-year to $8.8 billion, setting new June quarter revenue records in every geographic segment.

We continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this category.

 

This quarter, we began shipping our new Apple TV 4K with a redesign Siri remote and our brand new air tags, and the customer response to both products has been very strong.

In addition to its outstanding sales performance globally, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.

 

For Mac, despite supply constraints, we set a June quarter record of $8.2 billion up 16% over last year, with June quarter revenue records in most markets we track around the world.

It is remarkable that the last four quarters for Mac have been its best four quarters ever.

 

This exceptional level of sales success has been driven by the very enthusiastic customer response to our new Macs, powered by the M1 chip, which we most recently brought to our newly redesigned iMac.

iPad performance was also strong with revenue of $7.4 billion up 12% in spite of significant supply constraints.

 

During the quarter we also started shipping our new iPad Pro powered by the M1 chip and customer response has been outstanding.

Both iPad and Mac have taken computing to the next level, and when you combine their performance over the last 12-months, they're now the size of a Fortune-50 business, thanks to the best product lineups we've ever had, very high levels of customer satisfaction and a loyal growing installed base.

 

In fact, around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product.

And in most recent surveys of U.S.

 

consumers from 451 research customer satisfaction was 92% for Mac and 95% for iPad.

In enterprise, our customers are excited about the superior performance, battery life and security that the new M1 Macs bring.

 

MassMutual for example, is offering M1 MacBook Pro to all of its employees and equipping all conference rooms with M1 Mac minis in preparation for return to work.

And with its incredible performance and affordable entry price, the MacBook Air with M1 is gaining rapid adoption among many leading enterprise organizations.

 

Italgas, Italy's largest natural gas company, which will soon be using its extensive network to distribute renewable gases is replacing every employee's Windows laptop with the new MacBook Air powered by Apple's M1 chip to bring the latest technology to its workforce.

And Grab, Southeast Asia's leading super app that provides transportation, food delivery and digital payment services is adding M1 MacBook Air to its company-wide M1 Mac deployment.

 

Let me now turn to our cash position, we ended the quarter with $194 billion in cash plus marketable securities.

We retired $3 billion of term debt and increased commercial paper by $3 billion, leaving us with total debt of $122 billion.

 

As a result, net cash was $72 billion at the end of the quarter.

As our business continued to perform at a very high level, we were also able to return $29 billion to shareholders during the June quarter.

 

This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalence, and $17.5 billion through open market repurchases of 136 million Apple shares.

We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 32 million shares.

 

As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call.

Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near-term, we're not providing revenue guidance.

 

But we are sharing some directional insights, assuming that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we're projecting today for the current quarter.

We expect very strong double digit year-over-year revenue growth during the September quarter.

 

We expect revenue growth to be lower than our June quarter year-over-year growth of 36% for three reasons.

First, we expect the foreign exchange impact on our year-over-year growth rate to be three points less favorable than it was during the June quarter.

 

Second, we expect our services growth rate to return to a more typical level.

The growth rate during the June quarter benefited from a favorable compare, as certain services were significantly impacted by the COVID lockdowns a year ago.

 

And third, we expect supply constraints during the September quarter to be greater than what we experienced during the June quarter.

The constraints will primarily impact iPhone and iPad.

 

We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%.

We expect our OpEx to be between $11.3 billion and $11.5 billion.

 

We expect OI&E to be around zero, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.

Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividends with $0.22 per share of common stock payable on August 12, 2021, to shareholders of record as of August 9, 2021.

 

With that, let's open the call to questions.



Tim Cook

Thank you, Luca.

 

We ask that you limit yourself to two questions.

Operator, may we have the first question, please.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our first question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.

Please go ahead.

 

Katy, your line is open.

Please check your mute function.

 

We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.



Chris Caso

Thank you.

 

Good morning.

Just dig into the commentary on guidance a little bit.

 

Just starting with the fact that last year, obviously there was a later launch of iPhone than what was typically seen in other years.

Could you talk us through that, and perhaps some of the other products, what may be different as compared to last year?

 



Luca Maestri

Well, as I explained that, first of all, we are expecting to grow very strong double digits, that's I think Chris the starting point here.

 

We expect this very strong level of growth that we've experienced during the course of the year, to continue into the September quarter.

We said that the growth rate is going to be below 36%.

 

And I've listed three factors.

The first factor is that the dollar continues to be favorable on a year-over-year basis in the sense that it's weakened against most currencies on a year-over-year basis.

 

But that benefit is going to be about three points less in the September quarter than what we've experienced during the June quarter, because the dollar strengthened against most currencies in recent weeks.

Second, I mentioned that the services growth rate that we've experienced in the June quarter 33%, that's significantly higher than what we've had in recent history.

 

And that was due to the fact that there were a couple of services categories, namely, our advertising business and Apple Care, that were significantly impacted a year ago, because of the COVID lock downs.

And therefore, they're relatively easy compare in the June quarter.

 

So we don't expect that to continue into the September quarter.

And so we expect to see significant growth in services, but not to the level that we've seen in June.

 

And then I mentioned that the supply constraints that we've seen in the June quarter will be higher during the September quarter.

Back in when we talked here three months ago, we said that we were expecting supply constraints for the June quarter between $3 billion and $4 billion, to affect primarily iPad and Mac.

 

We were able to mitigate some of those constraints during the June quarter, and so we came in at a number that was slightly below the low-end of that range that we accorded at the beginning of the quarter.

But we expect that number to be higher for the September quarter.

 

And so when you put all that together, again, very strong double digit growth for September, with this caveat, that I just mentioned.



Chris Caso

Thank you.

 

If I could follow-up with regard to the supply constraints, and do you expect those supply constraints to persist through the December quarter as well?

What effect will that have on the holiday selling season?

 

And then, in conjunction with that, what additional costs are you absorbing because of the supply constraints?

Is that having an effect on gross margins or just product costs in general, as you perhaps pay a little more to get more supply?

 



Tim Cook

Chris, it's Tim.

 

In terms of the cost, we're paying more for freight than I would like to pay.

But component costs continue in the aggregate to decline.

 

In terms of supply constraints, and how long they will last, I don't want to predict that today.

We're going to take it sort of one quarter at a time.

 

And as you would guess we'll do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances were dealt.



Luca Maestri

And Chris, on the cost side, as I mentioned during my comments, our results for gross margins for the June quarter 43.3%, we really saw some really nice cost savings during the quarter.

 

And I think you've seen that we provided guidance for 41.5% to 42.5% for September, which is obviously a level that we are very pleased with.



Chris Caso

Right.

 

Thank you.



Tejas Gala

Thank you, Chris.

 

Can we have the next question please?
Operator

Thank you.

 

We'll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment Research.

Please go ahead.

 



Jim Suva

Thank you very much, and congratulations to you and your global team for great operations during a challenging time.

 

Tim and Luca, I just have one question and either of you or both of you could figure out who's best to answer it.

But we look at a world of pretty unprecedented whether it be COVID, the Delta variant, China floods, supply chain, components.

 

Just wondering for your, like R&D and innovation, is it being materially impacted by that such where a normal cadence is unfair?

Or, is it kind of happening during a slow time of year where you're able to empower people to work remotely, and still have the typical innovations and product launches that you've had historically in the past?

 



Tim Cook

Jim, the company has been incredibly resilient.

 

The employees are really doing double duty.

And I could not be more pleased with the cadence that we're coming out with new things.

 

As you can see from the software announcements that we made at WWDC, and the corresponding launches of the software that we plan on in the fall, and then all of the products that we've been able to bring out over the last 12 to 18-months, it's amazing.

So I'm very pleased with it.

 



Tejas Gala

Thanks, Jim.

 

Can we please the next question please?



Jim Suva

Thank you.

 

Congratulations again.



Tim Cook

Thank you.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

We'll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.



Shannon Cross

Thank you very much, Tim, I'm curious, what have you learned from this iPhone cycle regarding customer preferences and pricing and maybe subscriptions and that?

 

And if there's a difference, if you could talk about on a geographic basis.

Thanks.

 



Tim Cook

If you look at our results in Q3, Shannon, we had strong double digit growth for switchers and for upgraders.

 

And, in fact, it was our largest upgrade quarter for Q3 ever.

And so we feel really, really great about both categories.

 

And as Luca kind of said, during the preamble or opening comments, our results are really strong for iPhone around the world.

And so it's been a very, very strong cycle.

 

And yet we're -- the penetration on 5G is obviously still very, very low.

And so we feel really good about the future of the iPhone.

 



Shannon Cross

Okay.

 

And maybe if you can talk a bit about China, up 58%, where are you seeing the growth?

What are you hearing from customers there?

 

Obviously 58% is not sustainable, but how sustainable is the strength?

Thank you.

 



Tim Cook

It was an incredibly strong quarter, it set a June quarter revenue record for Greater China for us.

 

And so we're very proud of that.

And, doing the best job we can to serve customers there.

 

We had a particularly strong response to the 12 Pro and the 12 Pro Max.

Those results were particularly strong.

 

But if you look at the balance of our products, we also set June quarter records for Wearables, Home and Accessories, for Mac and for services.

So it was sort of an across the board strength.

 

And we're seeing plenty of new customers come to the market.

For example, Mac and iPad, about two-thirds of the customers who bought in the last quarter were new to that product.

 

For the Apple Watch that number was 85%.

And so, we could not be happier with the results.

 



Shannon Cross

Was 85% China or overall?

 



Tim Cook

85% was China.

 

I was talking about specifically the numbers of reference were specifically for China.



Luca Maestri

And Shannon, for the world with the Watch is 75%.

 



Shannon Cross

Right.

 

Great.

Thank you so much.

 



Tejas Gala

Thanks, Shannon.

 

Can we have the next question, please?
Operator

Thank you.

 

We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.

Please go ahead.

 



Amit Daryanani

Perfect.

 

Thanks a lot for taking my question, I have two, as well.

I guess first off Luca, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the gross margins and maybe the expectations you laid out for September, I think sequentially implies down 100 basis points or so.

 

So can you just touch on what are the puts and takes that would be helpful, because I think historically, September tends to be a flattish maybe even up a little bit gross margin number for you folks?



Luca Maestri

Yeah, I think it's important to go back to the Q3 results, it's 43.3%.

 

And one of the things that I mentioned is that in addition to getting really good cost savings on a sequential basis, we also had a very high mix of services as part of the total.

And particularly with advertising doing really, really well, because of the rebound that we saw from COVID lockdowns a year ago.

 

So as we move forward sequentially, we do expect a different mix and so that that drives the guidance that we provided which again, as you know, is significantly higher than just a year ago, for example.

A year ago, we were at 38.2%, so almost 400 basis points of expansion on a year-over-year basis.

 

And so, I think it's important to take that into account, just a different mix.



Amit Daryanani

Got it.

 

No, absolutely.

I don't think anyone expected gross margins to be north of 40 this quickly for you folks.

 

So that is impressive.

As a follow-up on services, and I know you've called out the 33% growth this quarter, as a bit of an aberration that compares easier.

 

But if you look at your services growth rate over the last four quarters, let's just say, what do you think is enabling this growth?

Is it you're able to have a higher ARPU more monetization of the installed base?

 

Or, is the installed base growing and choose which one's bigger?

And then over time, how do you think those two components stack up for you?

 



Luca Maestri

It's a combination of multiple factors.

 

Obviously, the fact that our installed base continues to grow, and it sets new all-time highs all the time, obviously, it gives us a larger opportunity all the time.

And second, we have more and more people that are engaged in our ecosystem, both transacting for free, which is a very large number, and people that are willing to pay for some of the services.

 

And that percentage of people that are paying for our services continues to grow nicely.

I mentioned, we grew double digits again this quarter.

 

So that obviously helps on the revenue side.

And of course, we continue to increase both the quality and the quantity of the services.

 

As you know, during the last few years, we've launched a lot of new services from Apple TV+, Fitness+, Apple Arcade, News+, of course, the Apple Card.

And so these are businesses that we are scaling right now, and so all that additional revenue helps.

 

And I think it flows through our growth rates, as you said, during the last four quarters we are well into the mid-20s.

So I think it's obviously very nice for us to see.

 



Amit Daryanani

Perfect.

 

Thank you.



Tejas Gala

Thanks, Amit.

 

Can we have the next question, please?
Operator

Thank you.

 

We’ll hear next from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.

Please go ahead.

 



Katy Huberty

Thank you.

 

Good afternoon.

Can you hear me okay?

 



Luca Maestri

Yes, we can.

 



Katy Huberty

Okay, good.

 

So first question, there's a debate in the market around how much Apple benefited from the pandemic, given increased spend in areas like Mac and App Store.

But of course, you've mentioned over the past several quarters that there are other areas that were limited by the pandemic, and store closures and less foot traffic.

 

When you net out all the puts and takes was your business helped?

Or, was it hindered by the pandemic?

 



Luca Maestri

Well, of course, Katy, we don't have the crystal ball that tells us exactly what these different variables, how they impacted our business.

 

We do know that I would say on the positive side of the ledger, obviously, especially during the periods of extreme lockdowns, digital services did very well because entertainment options were limited.

And so obviously, our digital services did really, really well.

 

Obviously with more people working from home, more people studying from home, we know that iPad and Mac demand was very, very strong.

On the other side we add certain services like advertising because of the reduced economic activity, Apple Care because our stores were closed, they were affected negatively.

 

And certain products like the iPhone or the Watch that are may be more complex types of sales because of the complexity of the transaction.

They were also affected because so many points of sale were closed all around the world, not only our stores but also our partner stores.

 

It’s difficult for us to gauge because we've been constrained for quite a long period of time.

And the reality is that maybe the new normal after we exit COVID may be different from the past.

 

For example, maybe there's going to be hybrid models around work, for example.

And so, it's difficult to tell you on a net basis what that is.

 

Clearly, and this is very fluid because it tends to change over time.

I can certainly tell you that we're all looking forward to a COVID free world, I think that would be very good for us and for our customers as well.

 



Katy Huberty

And just to follow-up on iPhones, specifically, if you look historically, after a really strong product cycle, which you've experienced this year with iPhone 12.

 

iPhone revenues come under pressure, because the upgrade rate slows, the mix often shifts to the lower end of the portfolio.

Is it fair to assume a similar trend will play out over the next year?

 

Or if not, time… [ph]



Tim Cook

Katy, it's Tim.

 

We're not predicting the next cycle.

But I would point out a few things.

 

One is we have a very large and growing installed base.

As you know with the iPhones passed a billion active devices earlier this year.

 

Two, we have loyal and satisfied customers.

The customer set we're seeing on the new iPhones are just amazing.

 

It's just jaw dropping.

And the geographic response is pervasive across the world.

 

In the U.S., we have the top three selling models.

In the UK, we have four out of the top five.

 

In Australia, we have the top two.

In Japan, we have the top three.

 

In urban China, we have the top two.

And so the response from customers all around had been great.

 

Obviously, the product itself is amazing.

The 12 lineup was a huge leap that introduced 5G and have A14 Bionic and a number of other fantastic features that customers love.

 

The next thing I think to consider is that we're in the very early innings of 5G.

If you look at our 5G penetration around the world there's only a couple of countries that are in the double digits yet.

 

And so that's an amazing thing, nine months or so into this.

And the last thing is we're going to continue to deliver great products.

 

We're going to continue to do what we do best is integrate hardware, software and services together into an amazing experience.

And so those are the things that I would consider if I were coming up with forecast.

 



Katy Huberty

That's great color.

 

Thank you.



Tejas Gala

Thanks, Katy.

 

Can we have the next question, please?
Operator

Thank you.

 

We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.



Harsh Kumar

Yeah.

 

Hey, guys, first of all, congratulations, fantastic execution that resulted in consistency for your results.

Tim, this is actually perfect timing for this question.

 

You talked about your installed base of a billion odd units.

I was curious if you could help us understand how all of that installed base is?

 

And the reason that I'm asking this question is we're clearly seeing people upgrade to 5G phones.

That's the case and that continues, that could be a larger force than most other forces for your revenues to continue to grow as people migrate to the 5G family of phones.

 

So I was curious, if you can shed light on how the upgrades are happening and then also, how old that base is?



Tim Cook

Yeah, what I would tell you is first of all, it's difficult to answer your question precisely.

 

But what I would tell you is on both switchers and upgraders, we did extremely well in Q3.

Both were up strong double digit, and the geographic representation of iPhone year-over-year comps looks extremely well.

 

And so we're really pleased with it.

I would remind you that the billion number that I quoted also was iPhone, where we quoted a number earlier in the year in the January call, I believe, of 1.65 billion devices is the total active devices just for clarification.

 

And so the net is very strong switchers, very strong upgraders, best upgrade quarter for the June quarter that we've seen.

And we feel really great about the momentum.

 

But at the same time, we recognize that the 5G penetration is quite low around the world.

And, they're very, very low.

 

We're at the front end of this.



Harsh Kumar

Fair enough.

 

For my follow-up, Apple's probably one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world.

How does Apple determine what's strategic, and something that Apple wants to make itself versus non-strategic?

 

And also was curious, there's a lot of -- well, it's public news now the Arm is getting acquired by Nvidia.

And I was just curious how Apple views that?

 

Is that something that's beneficial to Apple or not meaningful or negative?



Tim Cook

I think that acquisition has lots of questions that people are asking, and I'll sort of leave that up to everyone else.

 

And in terms of us and how we decide to make silicon, we ask ourselves, if we can do something better, if we can deliver a better product, if we can buy something in the market.

And it's great, and it's as good as what we could do, we're going to buy it.

 

We will only enter where we believe we have a ability to do something better, and therefore make a better product for the user.

And so the M1 is a great example of that.

 

We have the ability within our silicon team to deliver product that we feel is appreciably better than we could buy.

And so, we've taken our great hardware and software expertise, and combine those and have brought the M1 out.

 

And the response to the M1 has been unbelievable.

It's powering Mac sales that are constrained, it's powering now iPad, which also has constraints on it.

 

And so, that's how we look at whether we should enter into a market or not.



Harsh Kumar

Thank you.

 



Tim Cook

Thanks for the question.

 



Tejas Gala

Thank you.

 

Can we have the next question, please?
Operator

Certainly, we will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.

 

Please go ahead.



Krish Sankar

Hi, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong results.

 

First one for Luca, you mentioned services growth should normalize in the September quarter.

And I understand the last few quarters' services business was strong, driven by work from home, et cetera.

 

So what is the normalized growth rate for the services business as folks return back to the office in this post-COVID world?

And then I have a follow-up.

 



Luca Maestri

Well, I think, you can go back several quarters and try to do a bit of an average and that's what we were talking about.

 

Of course, there's always a bit of variability around results, right.

But certainly, we haven't done 33% in years and so that was a bit of an anomaly.

 

And again, I explained it's around a couple of the businesses that had a relatively easy compare during the June quarter.

So our services growth has been for many, many quarters in strong double digits and we feel confident around that level.

 



Krish Sankar

Got it.

 

And then just a follow-up for Tim or Luca.

I think, Tim, you mentioned in your prepared comments that in September quarter, there's going to be greater impact on supply constraints on the iPhone and iPad.

 

So I'm kind of curious, this is the first time I heard you talk about component shortages impacting the iPhone.

Can you be more specific?

 

Is it display drivers?

Or, what exactly is the choke point on the supply?

 



Tim Cook

The majority of constraints we're seeing are of the variety that I think others are saying that are I would classify as industry shortage.

 

We do have some shortages, in addition to that, that are where the demand has been so great and so beyond our own expectation that it's difficult to get the entire set of parts within the lead times that we try to get those.

So it's a little bit of that as well.

 

As I said before, I think probably maybe with the basis of your question, sort of the latest nodes, which we use in several of our products have not been as much of an issue.

The legacy nodes are where the supply constraints have been on the silicon.

 



Krish Sankar

Thanks, Tim.

 



Tim Cook

Yeah.

 



Tejas Gala

Thanks, Krish.

 

Can we have the next question, please?
Operator

Thank you.

 

We’ll hear the next question from David Vogt with UBS.



David Vogt

Great.

 

Thank you guys for the question.

So maybe just a point of clarification.

 

So based on the data and the comments about upgraders and switchers being strong, as well as emerging markets were relatively strong in the quarter.

What does that specific set of data points strength mean for the iPhone portfolio?

 

And I guess my question around that is, when you think about switchers and price points, I think last year, you launched the SE2 to really address maybe some of the lower price point markets like the emerging markets.

So does that mean thinking about the portfolio going forward, there's less of a need for a lower priced product going forward, and the current portfolio and the new cycle going forward would be more high-end in nature, as we currently have today?

 

And then I have a follow-up.



Tim Cook

David, we had an incredible quarter for the emerging markets in Q3.

 

We set June quarter records in Mexico, and Brazil, and Chile, in Turkey, and UAE, and Poland and Czech Republic, India.

Obviously, in China, as I've talked about before, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, I could go on in the name a few more, it's a very long list.

 

And so those results are for the entire line of products that we have.

And keep in mind, we still do have SE in the line, we launched it a year ago, but it's still in the line today.

 

And it’s sort of our entry price point.

And so, I'm pleased with how all of them are doing.

 

And I think we need to sort of that range of price points to accommodate the types of people that we want to accommodate.

So we've put something for the entry buyer who really wants to get into an iPhone, and then something for the pro buyer who wants the very best iPhone that they can buy.

 

And I think that's true in the emerging markets as good as it's true in the United States or other developed markets.



David Vogt

No, that's helpful.

 

I appreciate that, Tim.

So does that mean sort of the emerging market buyer that wants to get into the iPhone is looking for a device that has 5G capability as well?

 

Obviously, we're early innings in a lot of markets, or how do we think about that over the intermediate to longer-term in terms of consumer preference for 5G in those markets, if available from an infrastructure perspective?



Tim Cook

In most of the markets I read, it is really, really, really early on 5G, really early.

 

But I think the top end buyer is buying for the future as well, because they may hold their phone for two years or longer in some cases.

So, 5G becomes an important part of their buying decision.

 



David Vogt

Great.

 

Thank you very much.



Tejas Gala

Thank you.

 

Can we have the next question, please?
Operator

Thank you.

 

We'll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research Company.



Ben Bollin

Good evening, everyone.

 

Thanks for taking the question.

I wanted to start Luca or Tim, could you walk us through a little bit about how you think Apple One bundles are influencing the trajectory of services and the economics?

 

And then a second part on services, I'm curious how you think IDFA is developing and influencing the trajectory of the advertising business within services?



Tim Cook

In terms of Apple One as you know, we're offering Apple One because it makes enjoying our subscription services easier than ever before, including Apple Music and Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade and iCloud and more.

 

And so we really put the customer at the center of that and have recently began to remind people about Apple One in a way that we probably waited a few months before doing that.

And so, I'm very pleased with what we're seeing on Apple One right now.

 

I think it's a great ramp for the future services.

And more importantly, it's a great customer benefit because many of our customers like to try out more than one of these services, and it allows them to do that with one easy bundle and subscription service.

 

In terms of IDFA or the advertising in general, I take it your question is around ATT.

With ATT we've been getting quite a bit of customer positive reaction to being able to make the decision on a transparent basis about whether to be tracked or not.

 

And it seems to be going very well from a user point of view.



Tejas Gala

Thank you.

 

Can we have a question, please?
Operator

Thank you.

 

We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.



Wamsi Mohan

Yes, thank you, I have two as well.

 

To begin with Luca, you noted significant product revenue deleverage but yet your product gross margins were roughly flat, you know that cost savings.

Can you maybe talk about whether these are tactical in nature, or more structural like vertical integration that will continue to drive benefits to product gross margins?

 

And on services side, you noted several times about the strength in ad growth, which is obviously very high margin contributor, but the sequential trajectory on services margins was flat.

So what were some of the offsets there?

 

And I’ve a follow-up for Tim.



Luca Maestri

Yeah.

 

On the product side, I talked about cost savings.

Tim mentioned that, maybe on the freight side, we're seeing some level of cost pressure that is a bit out of the norm, at this point in the cycle.

 

For everything else, for all the major commodities and components, we continue to see a very typical cycle where we are getting good cost savings on a sequential basis.

And so far, it's been very good as you can tell from the absolute level of gross margins, because on the product side, we're up more than 600 basis points on a year-over-year basis.

 

So it feels something that we've been able to accomplish, and we were able to maintain, at least in the near-term, nothing that was abnormal during the quarter or a one-off in nature.

It was pretty structural.

 

On the services side, again, up a lot on a year-over-year basis.

So, the baseline has gone up a lot.

 

The sequential decline, as you said, it was very, very small.

And as I mentioned several times in the past, we have a very large services portfolio with very different margin profiles in our services.

 

And so even a slight change in mix can drive some sequential differences, and this was the case this quarter, just a different mix.

I mentioned for example, that Apple Care has rebounded.

 

And so the relative success of our services in the marketplace can drive some slight changes in gross margins.

Again, step back for a second, 69.8% gross margin we're very, very happy with where we are with the services margin trajectory.

 



Wamsi Mohan

Okay.

 

Thanks, Luca.

And Tim, there is increasing regulatory focus in China in particular on some of the Chinese companies.

 

It's not a direct impact of Apple, but how should investors handicap the indirect impact, given some of these companies are pretty large contributors to Apple's App Store revenues?

And also, is there -- are you seeing any impact at all from these?

 

And is the limiting of the usage of some of these apps influencing how people are either interacting with your devices, or is there any other ancillary impact that you're seeing?

Thank you.

 



Tim Cook

For the quarter, as you can see we grew 58% so it was a strong quarter.

 

And embedded in that was a quarterly record for services, which includes the App Store world.

So, we're seeing strength in China.

 

The economy has really bounced back there fairly quickly from COVID.

In terms of the regulatory focus, what we are focusing on from our angle is to serve users there and make sure that they're very satisfied with the products and services that we’re showing.

 

And we work with a lot of different companies to ensure that.

So that's our focus.

 



Tejas Gala

Thank you, Wamsi.

Colette Kress

Thank you, Simona.

 

Q3 was another exceptional quarter with record revenue of $4.73 billion, up 57% year-on-year, up 22% sequentially and well above our outlook.

Our new NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture is ramping with excellent demand across our major market platforms.

 

Q3 was also a landmark quarter, both for us and the industry as a whole.

As we announced plans to acquire Arm from SoftBank for $40 billion, we are incredibly excited about the combined company’s opportunities and we are working through the regulatory approval process.

 

For today, we will focus our remarks on our quarterly performance.

Starting with gaming.

 

Revenue was a record $2.27 billion, up 37% year-on-year, up 37% sequentially, and ahead of our high expectations.

Driving strong growth was our new NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GeForce RTX 30 series of gaming GPUs.

 

The GeForce RTX 3070, 3080 and 3090 GPUs offer up to two times the performance and two times the power efficiency over the previous Turing-based generation.

Our second generation NVIDIA RTX combines ray tracing and AI to deliver the greatest ever generational leap in performance.

 

First announced on September 1st and ranging in price from $499 to $1,499, these GPUs have generated amazing reviews and overwhelming demand.

PC World called them staggeringly powerful, while Newegg cited more traffic than Black Friday.

 

Many of our retail and e-tail partners sold out instantly, the RTX 30 series drove our biggest ever launch.

While we had anticipated strong demand, it exceeded even our bullish expectations.

 

Given industry-wide capacity constraints and long cycle times, it may take a few more months for product availability to catch up with demand.

In addition to the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture, we announced powerful new tools for gamers as well as for tens of millions of live streamers, broadcasters, eSports professionals, artists and creators.

 

NVIDIA Reflex is a new technology that improves reaction time in games, reducing system latency by up to 58%.

NVIDIA Reflex is being integrated into popular eSports games, such as Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone, Fortnite and Valorant.

 

NVIDIA Broadcast is a universal plugin for video conferencing and live streaming applications that enhances the quality of microphones, speakers and webcams with NVIDIA AI effects such as audio noise removal, virtual background effects, and webcam audio frame.

With this, remote workers and live streamers can turn any room into a broadcast studio.

 

Blockbuster games continue to adopt NVIDIA’s RTX ray tracing and AI technology.

Epic Games announced that Fortnite, which has more than 350 million players worldwide, is adding NVIDIA RTX real-time ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS AI super-resolution and NVIDIA Reflex, making the game more beautiful and even more responsive.

 

Other major new titles featuring RTX this holiday season include Watch Dogs: Legion, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, and much anticipated Cyberpunk 2077.

Gaming laptop demand was also strong with double-digit year-on-year growth for the 11th quarter in a row.

 

NVIDIA GeForce laptops support the most demanding applications for creators and designers while doubling as a powerful gaming [indiscernible].

We also have record gaming console revenue on strong demand for the Nintendo Switch.

 

And we continue to grow our cloud gaming service, GeForce NOW, which has doubled in the past seven months to reach over 5 million registered users.

GeForce NOW is unique as an open platform that connects to popular game stores, including Steam, Epic Games, and Ubisoft Connect, allowing gamers access to the titles they already own.

 

750 games are currently available on GFN, the most of any cloud gaming platforms, including 75 free to play games, with more games added every Thursday.

GFN supports many popular clients, including PCs, Macs and Chromebooks.

 

Stay tuned for more devices to come in the near future.

In addition, GFN’s reach continues to expand through our telco partners in a growing list of countries, including Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Russia, and Saudi Arabia.

 

We are also providing technology that enables the cloud gaming services to an expanding number of partners.

Following our earlier announcement with Tencent, Amazon and Facebook are beginning to offer cloud gaming services powered by NVIDIA.

 

Moving to ProViz, Q3 revenue was $236 million, down 27% year-on-year and up 16% sequentially, ahead of our expectations.

Sequential growth was driven by strength in notebooks, which posted record revenue, boosted by work-from-home initiatives and a shift to thin and light mobile workstations.

 

This is particularly offset by decline in desktop workstations, which continued to be impacted by the pandemic and drove the year-on-year decline.

From an industry demand perspective, stronger verticals including healthcare, public sector, higher education and research, and financial services, we continue to win new business in a number of areas.

 

In healthcare, we added Medtronic for visual surgical applications and [indiscernible] for medical imaging.

In technology and media and entertainment, we gained wins for design, rendering and broadcast applications.

 

During the quarter, we announced the Omniverse, the world’s first 3D collaboration and simulation platforms has entered open beta.

Omniverse enables the tens of millions of designers, architects and creators to collaborate real time, on-premises or remotely.

 

Fusing the virtual and physical worlds, Omniverse brings together NVIDIA breakthroughs in graphics, simulation and AI.

It will help enterprises address evolving requirements as workforces become increasingly distributed.

 

Initial market response from this transformative platform has been phenomenal.

Over 400 individual creators and developers in diverse industries have been evaluating Omniverse, and early adopters including Ericsson, BMW, Foster and Partners, and Lucasfilm.

 

The pandemic is accelerating development of AR, VR and mixed reality technologies, which will have a profound impact on how we work and play.

For example, our work with NASCAR to enable a variety of AR and VR services at the edge is revolutionizing the racing experience for millions of fans across the globe.

 

With our industry-leading real-time ray tracing graphics, AI and simulation hardware and software stacks, NVIDIA is in a unique position to enable the future of blending the physical and virtual worlds.

Moving to automotive, Q3 revenue was $125 million, down 23% year-on-year and up 13% sequentially.

 

Sequential growth was driven by a recovery in global automotive production volumes, as well as continued growth in AI cockpit revenue.

The year-on-year decline was due to the expected ramp-down of legacy infotainment revenue.

 

In September, Mercedes-Benz debuted its redesign of S-class sedan, featuring an all new NVIDIA powered MBUX AI cockpit system with an augmented reality heads-up display, AI voice assistant, and rich interactive graphics to enable every passenger in the vehicle to enjoy personalized, intelligent features.

Also in September, Li Auto, a leading electric car brand in China announced that it will develop its next generation of vehicles using the software defined NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin platform.

 

Orin delivers nearly 7 times the performance and 3 times the energy efficiency of our previous generation SOC, making it uniquely capable to power next generation autonomous electric vehicles.

We have excellent traction with EV startups.

 

Finally, last week NVIDIA and Hyundai Motor Group announced that the automaker’s entire lineup of Hyundai, Kia and Genesis models will come standard with NVIDIA DRIVE in-vehicle infotainment systems, starting in 2022.

This feature-rich software-defined computing platform will allow vehicles to be perpetually upgraded with the latest AI cockpit features.

 

Now moving to data center.

Revenue was a record $1.9 billion, up 162% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially, driving growth with a strong ramp of our A100-based platforms, continued growth with Mellanox and record T4 shipments for inference.

 

Let me give you a little bit of color on each.

Our new NVIDIA Ampere architecture gained further adoption by cloud and hyperscale customers and started ramping into vertical industries.

 

Over the past weeks, Amazon Web Services, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Alibaba Cloud announced general availability of the A100, following Google Cloud platform and Microsoft Azure.

A100 adoption by vertical industries drove strong growth, as we began shipments to server OEM partners whose broad enterprise channels reach a large number of end customers.

 

We also ramped the DGX A100 server and began shipping NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, the first turnkey AI infrastructure.

These range from 20 to 140 DGX A100 systems interconnected with Mellanox’s HDR InfiniBand networking and enable customers to install incredibly powerful AI supercomputers in just a few weeks’ time.

 

In fact, we have announced plans to build an 80-node DGX SuperPOD with 400 petaflops of AI performance, called Cambridge-1, which will be in the UK’s fastest AI supercomputer.

So, it will be used by NVIDIA researchers for collaborative research within the UK’s AI and healthcare community across academia, industry and startups.

 

It joins other systems in NVIDIA’s complex of AI supercomputers powered by our R&D and autonomous vehicles, conversational AI, robotics, graphics, HPC and other domains.

This includes Selene, now the world’s fifth fastest supercomputer and fastest commercial supercomputer and a new NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, which ranks first on the Green500 list of the world’s most energy efficient supercomputers.

 

A great example of the tremendous opportunities for AI in healthcare is our new partnership with GSK, for applying computational to the drug and vaccine discovery process.

GSK’s London-based AI hub will utilize biomedical data, AI methods, and advanced computing platforms to unlock genetic and clinical data with increased precision and scale.

 

In addition to this investment in NVIDIA’s DGX A100 system, GSK will have access to NVIDIA’s Cambridge-1, the NVIDIA drug discovery software and NVIDIA scientists.

In Q3, the A100 swept the industry standard MLPerf benchmark for AI inference performance, following our suite in the prior quarter’s MLPerf benchmark for AI training.

 

Notably, our performance was in AI inference actually extended compared with last year’s benchmark.

For example, in the ResNet-50 test for image recognition, our A100 GPU beat CPU-only systems by 30 times this year versus 6 times last year.

 

Additionally, A100 outperformed CPUs by up to 237 times in the newly added recommend data test, which represents some of the most complex and widely used AI models on the internet.

Our winning performance in AI inference is translating to continued strong revenue growth.

 

Alongside the continued ramp of the A100, T4 sales set a record as the NVIDIA AI inference adoption is in full throttle.

We estimate that NVIDIA installed GPU capacity for inference across the seven largest public clouds now exceeds that of the aggregate CPU capacity in the cloud, testament to the tremendous performance and TCO advantage of our GPUs.

 

Hundreds of companies now operate AI-enabled services on NVIDIA’s inference platforms, including the A100 or T4 GPU, and our Triton, inference serving software.

For example, Tencent uses NVIDIA AI inference to recommend video, music, news and apps, supporting billions of queries per day.

 

Microsoft uses NVIDIA AI inference for grammar correction in Microsoft Office, supporting 0.5 trillion queries a year.

And American Express uses it for real-time fraud detection.

 

We also gained tremendous traction in supercomputing.

We announced that NVIDIA technology, including Ampere architecture GPUs, and HDR InfiniBand networking will power five systems awarded by EuroHPC, a European initiative to build extra scale supercomputing.

 

This includes CINECA, a university consortium in Italy and one of the world’s most important supercomputing centers, which will use NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform to build the world’s fastest AI supercomputer.

CINECA supercomputer named Leonardo advances the age of exascale AI, delivering 10 exaflops of AI performance to enable AI and high-performance computing converge applications use cases.

 

It is built with nearly 14,000 NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GPUs and Mellanox HDR 200 gigabit per second InfiniBand networking.

And just released top 500 list of supercomputers show that NVIDIA GPUs or network empowered nearly 70%, and 8 of the 10 top supercomputers on the list.

 

Mellanox had another record quarter with double-digit sequential growth well ahead of our expectations, contributing 13% of overall Company revenue.

The upside reflected sales to China OEM that will not recur in Q4.

 

As a result, we expect a meaningful sequential revenue decline from Mellanox in Q4, but still growing 30% from last year.

Mellanox reached record revenue in both InfiniBand and Ethernet, driven by cloud, enterprise and supercomputing customers.

 

Strong demand for high-performance interconnects where Mellanox is leader is being fueled by AI increasingly complex applications, which demand faster, smarter, more scalable networks.

As the data center becomes the new unit of computing in the age of AI, Mellanox networking is foundational to modern scalable architectures.

 

At GTC in October, we unveiled the BlueField-2 DPU, or data processing unit, a new kind of processor, which offloads critical networking, storage and security tasks from the CPU.

A single BlueField-2 DPU can deliver the same data center services that consume up to 125 CPU cores.

 

This frees up valuable CPU cores to run a wide range of other enterprise applications.

In addition, it enables zero trust security features to prevent data breaches and cyber attacks and accelerates overall performance.

 

VMware announced that it will offload, accelerate and isolate its industry leading ESXi hypervisor with NVIDIA’s BlueField-2 DPU, boosting vSphere and data center performance and efficiency.

We also unveiled our three-year DPU roadmap, unified Mellanox’s leading network capabilities with NVIDIA’s GPUs and the new NVIDIA DOCA or data-center-on-a-chip architecture.

 

Software development kit for building DPU accelerated applications.

We believe that over time DPUs will ship a millions of servers, unlocking a $10 billion total addressable market.

 

BlueField-2 is sampling now with major hyperscale customers and will be integrated into the enterprise server offerings of major OEMs.

This was our busy period for product launches.

 

Earlier this week at Supercomputing 2020, we announced the new double capacity, A100 80 gigabyte GPUs and DGX systems for organizations to build, train and deploy massive AI models.

We also announced the new DGX Station A100, a powerful workgroup server with four A100 GPUs and a massive 320 gigabyte GPU memory for data scientists and AI researchers working in offices, research facilities, labs or at home.

 

All these additions to the NVIDIA Ampere architecture family of products will be available early next year.

At SC20, we also announced the next generation NVIDIA Mellanox 400 gigabit per second InfiniBand architecture, giving AI developers and scientific researchers the fastest available networking performance.

 

This doubles data throughput and adds new in network computing engine to provide additional acceleration.

Solutions based on this new architecture are expected to sample in the second quarter of calendar 2021.

 

Moving to the rest of the P&L.

Q3 GAAP gross margin was 62.6% and non-GAAP gross margin was 65.5%.

 

GAAP gross margin declined year-on-year, primarily due to charges related to the Mellanox acquisition, partially offset by product mix.

The sequential increase was driven by the absence of non-recurring inventory step-up expense related to the Mellanox acquisition.

 

Non-GAAP gross margins increased by 140 basis points year-on-year, reflecting a shift in product mix with higher data center sales, including the contribution from Mellanox.

Non-GAAP gross margin was down 50 basis points sequentially, in line with our expectations, driven by product mix.

 

Q3 GAAP operating expenses were $1.56 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.1 billion, up 6% and 42% from a year ago, respectively.

Q3 GAAP, EPS was $2.12, up 46% from a year earlier, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.91, up 63% from a year ago.

 

Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.28 billion.

With that, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.

 

As a reminder, Q4 includes a 14th week, which we expect to be incrementally -- addition to revenue and operating expenses.

We expect gaming to be up sequentially in what is typically a seasonally down quarter, as we continue to ramp up our new RTX 30 Series products.

 

We expect data center to be down slightly versus Q3.

With that, we expect computing products to grow in the mid-single-digit sequentially, more than offset by sequential decline in Mellanox.

 

We expect continued sequential growth in auto and ProViz but not yet returning to year-on-year growth.

And we expect a seasonal decline in OEM.

 

Revenue is expected to be $4.8 billion, plus or minus 2%.

GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.8% and 65.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.

 

GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.64 billion and $1.1 8 billion, respectively.

GAAP and non-GAAP, other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $55 million.

 

GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 8%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items.

Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million to $325 million.

 

Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.

In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community.

 

We’ll be virtually attending the Credit Suisse Technology Conference on November 30th, Wells Fargo TMT Summit December 1st and the UBS TMT Conference on December 7th.

Our earnings call to discuss the fourth quarter and full-year results is scheduled for Wednesday, February 24th.

 

We will now open the call for questions.

Operator, would you please poll for questions?

 
Operator

Certainly.

 

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.

Your line is open.

 



John Pitzer

Can you hear me?

 



Jensen Huang

Yes.

 



John Pitzer

Yes.

 

Hey, guys.

Congratulations on the solid results.

 

Thank you for letting me ask the question.

Just Colette, going back to your commentary around Mellanox, it seems like you’re guiding the January quarter to about $500 million, which means the core data center business is still growing nicely, call it, 6%, 7% sequentially.

 

I’m just kind of curious, when you look at the core data center business, I know there’s not a direct correlation to server business.

But, we’re clearly going through a cloud digestion in server and core vertical markets, enterprise, the servers are weak.

 

When you look at your core data center business, do you feel as though that’s having an impact, and this is sort of the digestion that you saw kind of in late fiscal ‘20 -- sorry, fiscal ‘19 into ‘20, but you’re doing it still growing significantly year-over-year, or how would you characterize the macro backdrop?



Colette Kress

Sure.

 

Let me clarify for those also on the call.

Yes, we expect our data center revenue in total to be down slightly quarter-over-quarter.

 

The computing products, NVIDIA computing product is expected to grow in the mid-single-digits quarter-over-quarter as we continue the NVIDIA AI adoption and particularly as A100 continues to ramp.

Our networking, our Mellanox networking is expected to decline meaningful quarter-over-quarter as sales to that China OEM will not recur in Q4, though we still expect the results to be growth of 30% or more year-over-year.

 

The timing of some of this business therefore shifted from Q4 to Q3, but overall H2 is quite strong.

So, in referring to overall digestion, the hyperscale business remains extremely strong.

 

We expect hyperscale to grow quarter-over-quarter in computing products as A100 continues to ramp.

The A100 continues to gain adoption, not only across those hyperscale customers, but again we’re also receiving great momentum in inferencing with the A100 and the T4.

 

I’ll turn it over here to Jensen to see if he has more that he would like to add.



Jensen Huang

Yes.

 

Colette captured it very well.

The only thing I would add is that our inference initiative is really gaining great momentum.

 

Inference is one of the hardest computer science problems.

Compiling these gigantic neural network computational graphs into a target device really, really -- has proven to be really, really hard.

 

The models are diverse when you count vision to language to speech.

And there are so many different types of models being created that model sizes are doubling every couple of months.

 

The latency expectations are increasing all the time, -- or latency is decreasing all the time.

And so, the pressure on inference is really great.

 

The technology pressure is really great.

And our leadership there is really pulling ahead.

 

We’re in our seventh generation tensorRT.

We, over the course of the last couple of years, developed an inference server.

 

It’s called Triton, has been adopted all over the place.

We have several hundred customers now using NVIDIA AI to deploy their AI services.

 

This is in the early innings, and I think this is going to be our largest near-term growth opportunity.

So, we’re really firing on all cylinders there between the A100s ramping in the cloud, A100s beginning to ramp in enterprise, and all of our inference initiatives are really doing great.

 



John Pitzer

Jensen, maybe to follow on there just on the vertical markets, clearly work-from-home and COVID this year kind of presented a headwind to new technology deployments on-prem.

 

I’m kind of curious, if we expect sort of an enterprise recovery in general next year, how do you think that will translate into your vertical market strategy?

And is there anything else above and beyond that you can do to help accelerate penetration of AI into that end market?

 



Jensen Huang

Yes.

 

John, that’s a good point.

I mean, it’s very clear that the inability to go to work is slowing down the adoption of new technology in some of the verticals.

 

Of course, we’re seeing rapid adoption in certain verticals, like for example using AI in health care to rapidly discover new vaccines and early detection with outbreaks and robotic applications.

So, warehouses, digital retail, last mile delivery, we’re just seeing just really, really great enthusiasm around adopting new AI and robotics technology.

 

But in some of the more traditional industries, new capabilities and new technologies are slow to deploy.

One of the areas that I’m really super excited about is the work that we’re doing in remote work and making it possible for people to collaborate remotely.

 

We have a platform called Omniverse.

It’s in early beta.

 

The feedback from the marketplace has been really great.

And so, I’ve got a lot more to report to you guys in the upcoming months around Omniverse.

 

And so -- but anyways, I think, when the industry recover, we serve -- our fundamental purpose as a company is to solve the greatest challenges that impact the industry where ordinary computers can’t.

And these challenges are -- serve some of the most important applications in the verticals that we address.

 

And they’re not commodity applications.

They’re really impactful, needle-moving applications.

 

So, I have every confidence that when the industries recover, things will get designed.

Cars will be designed, and planes will be designed, and ships will be designed, and buildings will be designed.

 

And we’re going to see a lot of design, and we’re going to see a lot of simulation.

We’re going to see a lot of robotics applications.

 
Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of C.J.

 

Muse from Evercore.

Your line is open.

 



C.J. Muse

You talked about in your prepared remarks limited availability of capacity components.

 

You suggested perhaps a few months to catch up.

Curious if you can speak to the visibility that you have for both, gaming and data center into your April quarter?

 



Jensen Huang

Yes.

 

Colette, do you want me to take that real quick and maybe you can help me out?



Colette Kress

Yes, absolutely.

 



Jensen Huang

So, C.J., first off, we have a lot of visibility into the channel, as you know, especially for gaming.

 

And we know how many weeks of inventory is in what parts of the channel.

We’ve been draining down the channel inventory for Turing for some time.

 

And meanwhile, we’ve also expected a very, very successful launch with Ampere.

And even with our bullish demand expectation and all of the Amperes that we built, which is one of the fastest ramps ever, the demand is still overwhelming.

 

And this I guess in a lot of ways is kind of expected, the circumstances are -- it’s been a decade since we’ve invented a new type of computer graphics.

I mean, two years ago, we invented [indiscernible] and it set the industry on course to create the type of images that we see today.

 

But, it’s very clear that the future is going to look something much, much more beautiful.

And we invented NVIDIA RTX to do that.

 

And it has two capabilities, one based on ray tracing and the other one is based on artificial intelligence image generation.

The combination of those two capabilities is creating images that people are pretty ecstatic about.

 

And at this point, it’s defined the next-generation content.

And so when we -- it took us 10 years to invent it.

 

We launched it two years ago and took our second generation to really achieve the level of quality and performance that the industry -- that they really expect.

And now, the demand is just overwhelming.

 

And so, we’re going to continue to ramp fast.

And this is going to be one of our most successful ramps ever.

 

And it gives our installed base of some 200-million-plus GeForce gamers the best reason to upgrade in over a decade.

And so, this is going to be a very large generation for us is my guess.

 

And then, with respect to data center, we’re ramping into A100.

A100 is our first generation of GPUs that does several things at the same time.

 

It’s universal.

We position it as a universal because it’s able to do all of the applications that we in the past had to have multiple GPUs to do.

 

It does training well.

It does inference incredibly well.

 

It does high-performance computing.

It does data analytics.

 

And so, it’s able -- the Ampere architecture is able to do all of this at the same time.

And so, the utilization for data centers is -- and the utility is really, really fantastic, and the reception has been great.

 

And so, we’re going to ramp into all of the world’s clouds.

I think, starting this quarter, we’re now in every major cloud provider in the world, including Alibaba or Golan, [ph] and of course the giants, the Amazon, the Azure and Google Clouds.

 

And we’re going to continue to ramp into that.

And then, of course, we’re starting to ramp into enterprise, which in my estimation, long term will still be the largest growth opportunity for us, turning every industry into a AI, turning every company into AIs and augment it with Al and bringing the iPhone moment to all of the world’s largest industries.

 

And so, we’re ramping into that, and we’re seeing a great deal of enthusiasm.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.

 

Your line is open.



Stacy Rasgon

You said that the extra week was contributing incrementally to revenue and OpEx.

 

Can you give us some feeling for how much is contributing to revenue and OpEx in Q4?

And does that impact, at least on the revenue side, differ, say between like gaming and data center?

 

And then, how should we think about it impacting seasonality into Q1 as that extra week rolls off?



Colette Kress

Sure.

 

Let me try this one, Jensen.

Yes, we’ve incorporated that 14th week into our guidance for both, revenue and OpEx.

 

We will likely have incrementally positive impact on revenue, although it is tough to quantify, okay?

Our outlook also reflects incremental OpEx for Q4 in primarily two different areas in terms of compensation and depreciation.

 

And given that our employees with such a material power of our OpEx, it will -- it can be close to one-fourteenth of the quarter.

Now, when we look a little bit farther, we should think about the incremental positive in both, gaming and data center from that extra week as there hopefully will be extra supply, but not likely as much as one-fourteenth of the quarter of revenue as enterprise demand is essentially project-based, and game demand though is tied to the number of gaming that gamers that might be shopping for the overall holiday.

 

So, again, still very hard for us to determine at this time.

Normally, between Q4 and Q1 there is seasonality in gaming, seasonality downward.

 

But, we’ll just have to see as we are still supply-constrained within this Q4 to see what that looks like.

From an OpEx standpoint, we’ll probably expect our OpEx to be relatively flattish as we move from Q4 to Q1.

 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.

 



Vivek Arya

Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth.

 

Jensen, my question is on competition from internally designed products by some of your larger cloud customers, Amazon and Google and others.

We hear about competition from time to time.

 

And I wanted to get your perspective.

Is this a manageable risk?

 

Is the right way to think that they are perhaps using more of your product in their public cloud, but they are moving to internal products for internal workloads?

Just how should we think about this risk going forward?

 

Thank you.



Jensen Huang

Thanks, Vivek.

 

Most of the cloud vendors, in fact, I believe all of the cloud vendors use the same infrastructures largely for their internal cloud and external cloud, or have the ability to or largely do.

And, there’s -- the competition, we find to be really good.

 

And the reason for that is this.

It just suggests that acceleration -- they make it very clear, that acceleration is right path forward for training and inference.

 

The vast majority of the world’s training models are doubling in size every couple of months, and it’s one of the reasons where our demand is so great.

The second is inference.

 

The vast majority of the world’s inference is not on CPUs.

And nothing is better than the whole world recognizing that the best way forward is to do inference on accelerators.

 

And when that happens, our accelerator is the most versatile.

It is the highest performance.

 

We move the fastest.

Our rate of innovation is the fastest because we’re also the most dedicated to it, we’re most committed to it, and we have the largest team in the world to it.

 

Our stack is the most advanced, giving us the greatest versatility and performance.

And so, we see spots of announcement here and there.

 

But, they’re also our largest customers.

And as you know that we’re ramping quite nicely at Google, we’re ramping quite nicely at Amazon and Microsoft and Alibaba and Oracle and others.

 

And so, I think, the big takeaway is that -- and the great opportunity for us if you look at the vast amount of workload -- AI workload in the world, the vast majority of it today is still on CPUs.

And it’s very clear that this is going to be an accelerated workload.

 

And we’re the best accelerator in the world.

And, this is going to be a really big growth opportunity for us in near term.

 

In fact, we believe it’s our largest growth opportunity in near term.

And we’re in the early innings of it.

 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP Morgan.

 

Your line is open.



Harlan Sur

Good afternoon.

 

Thanks for taking my question, and great job on the quarterly execution.

The Mellanox networking connectivity business was up 80% year-over-year.

 

I think, it was up about 13%, 14% sequentially.

I know there was upside in October from one China customer, but it did grow 70% year-over-year last quarter, and you’re still expecting 30% year-over-year growth next quarter.

 

If I remember correctly, I think, InfiniBand is about 40% of that business; Ethernet Cloud is about 60%.

Jensen, what are the big drivers, especially since we’re in the midst of a cloud spending digestion cycle?

 

And I just saw that the team announced their next-gen 400-gig InfiniBand solution, which should drive another strong adoption cycle with your supercomputer customers.

When does this upgrade cycle start to fire?

 



Jensen Huang

Yes.

 

Let’s see.

Our data center business consists of supercomputing centers, which is small, high-performance computing, which is a much larger part of super computing, much larger than supercomputing, and then hyperscale and enterprise, which about 50-50.

 

Of the data center business, the accelerated computing part is not very much associated with digestion than others.

It’s much more associated with workloads and our new product cycles, the TCO that we bring in and AI inference, the type of models that the cloud service providers are deploying, whether they’re deploying new AI models, based on deep learning, and how much of it that we -- how much of those workloads that we’ve completed, the porting to our accelerators and ready it for deployment.

 

And so, those are the factors associated with accelerated computing.

It’s really about the apps, it’s really about the workloads and really driven by AI.

 

On the other hand, the networking part of our business is more connected to CPU business because they’re much more broad-based.

The networking part of our business is driven by this idea of new hyperscale data center architecture called disaggregation.

 

It’s software disaggregation, not necessarily hardware disaggregation.

Software disaggregation, where this type of software called Kubernetes orchestrate microservices that are deployed across the data center.

 

So, one service, one application isn’t monolithic running on one computer anymore.

It’s distributed across multiple computers and multiple nodes, so that the hyperscale data centers can more easily scale up and scale out according to the workloads and according to the demand on the data center.

 

And so, this disaggregation has caused the networking between the compute nodes to be of all vital importance.

And because Mellanox is the lowest-latency, highest-performance, highest-bandwidth network that you can get the TCO benefit at the data center scale is really fantastic.

 

And so, when they’re building out data centers, Mellanox is going to be much more connected to that.

In the enterprise side of it, depending on new CPU cycles, it could affect them.

 

If a CPU cycle were to delay a little bit, it would affect them by a quarter, it would pull-in by a quarter -- it would affect them by pull-in of a quarter.

And so, those are kind of the dynamics of it.

 

I think, that the net-net of it is that it’s a foregone conclusion at this point that AI is going to be the future of the way software is run.

AI is the most powerful technology force of our time.

 

And acceleration is the best path forward.

And so, that’s what drives our computing business.

 

And the networking business has everything to do with the way architecture of data centers, cloud data centers, which is architected with micro services now.

And that’s what foundationally drives their -- our networking work business demand.

 

And so, we’re really well-positioned in these two fundamental dynamics because as we know, AI is the future and cloud computing is the future.

Both of those dynamics are very favorable to us.

 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.

 

Your line is open.



Timothy Arcuri

Thanks a lot.

 

I wanted to ask a question that was asked before in a bit of a different way.

If I look at the core business, excluding Mellanox, the core data center business, it was up about 6% sequentially the past two quarters, and your guidance sort of implies up about that much again in January, which is certainly good, and there is some cloud digestion.

 

But, of course you have Ampere still ramping as well, which should be a pretty good tailwind.

So, there seems to be some offsetting factors.

 

So, I guess, I wonder if you feel like your core data center revenue is still being constrained right now by some market digestion.

And kind of how you sort of balance or handicap these two factors?

 

Thanks.



Jensen Huang

Our growth is -- in the near term is more affected by the cycle time of manufacturing and flexibility of supply.

 

We are in a good shape to -- and all of our supply is -- informs our guidance.

But, we would appreciate shorter cycle times; we would appreciate more agile supply chains.

 

But, the world is constrained at the moment.

And so, we just have to make the best of it.

 

But, even in that condition - even in that condition, we’ve -- all of that is building for our guidance, and we expect to grow.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.

 

Your line is open.



Aaron Rakers

Yes.

 

Thanks for taking the question, and also congratulations on the quarter.

I wanted to go back to kind of the Mellanox question.

 

I know prior to the acquisition, Mellanox was growing maybe in the mid to high-20% range.

These last two quarters, it’s grown over 75%.

 

I guess, the simple question is how do you think about the growth rate for Mellanox going forward?

And on that topic, we started to hear you talk more about BlueField and data processing units.

 

I think, in your commentary, you alluded to server OEM design wins incorporating these DPUs.

What are you looking at, or when should we think about the DPU business really starting to inflect and become a material driver for the business?

 

Thank you.



Jensen Huang

Long term, every computer in the world will be built like a data center.

 

And every node of a data center is going to be a data center in itself.

And the reason for that is because we want the attack surface to be basically zero.

 

And today, most of the data centers are only protected as a periphery.

But in the future, if you would like cloud computing to be the architecture for everything and every data center is multi-tenant, every data center is secure, then you’re going to have to secure every single node.

 

And each one of those nodes are going to be a software-defined networking, software-defined storage, and it’s going to have per application security.

And so, the processing that it will need to offload, the CPUs, is really quite significant.

 

In fact, we believe that somewhere between 20% to 40% of today’s data centers -- cloud data centers is the capacity, the throughput, the computational load is consumed running basically the infrastructure overhead.

And that’s what the DPUs intended -- was designed to do.

 

We’re going to offload that, number one; and number two, we’re going to make every single application secure.

And confidential competing, zero trust computing will become a reality.

 

And so, the importance is really quite tremendous.

And I believe therefore that every single server in the world will have a DPU inside someday, just because we care so much about security and just because we care so much about throughput and TCO.

 

And it’s really the most cost-effective way of building a data center.

And so, I expect our DPU business to be quite large.

 

And so, that’s the reason why we’re putting so much energy into it.

It’s a programmable data center on a chip, think of that way, and data center infrastructure on a chip.

 

It is the reason why we’re working with VMware on taking the operating system in the data center, the software-defined operating system in the data center, putting bring it on BlueField.

And so, this is a very important initiative for us.

 

I’m very excited about it, as you can imagine.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets.

 

Your line is open.



Ambrish Srivastava

Yes.

 

Thank you very much.

Colette -- and I apologize if I missed it, but for Mellanox, do you expect it to get back to the growth trajectory on a sequential basis in the April quarter?

 

And I’m assuming that the shortfall in the current quarter is from a pull-in from Huawei?



Colette Kress

So, our impact to our Q4 guidance for Mellanox, yes, is impacted by a sale to a China OEM for Mellanox.

 

That will not recur in Q4.

And as we look forth into Q1 of April, we’re going to take this a quarter at a time and provide thoughts and guidance for that once we turn the corner to the new fiscal year.

 



Jensen Huang

At the highest level, Colette, I think, the -- it’s safe to say that high-speed networking is going to be one of the most important things in cloud data centers as we go forward.

 

And the vast majority of the world’s data center is still built for the traditional hyper-converged architecture, which is all moving over to microservices-based disaggregate --software-defined disaggregated architectures.

And that journey is still in its early days.

 

And so, I fully expect future cloud data centers -- all future data centers are going to be connected with high-speed networking inside.

They call it east-west traffic.

 

And, all of the traffic will be secured.

And so, imagine building firewalls into every single server.

 

And imagine every single transaction, every single transmission inside the data center to be high speed and fully encrypted.

And so, pretty amazing amount of computation is going to have to be installed into future data centers.

 

But, that’s an accepted requirement now.

And I think, our networking business, Mellanox is in the early innings of growth.

 
Operator

Your final question today comes from the line of William Stein from Truist Securities.

 

Your line is open.



William Stein

Great.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

You’ve given us some pieces of this puzzle.

 

But, I’m hoping maybe you can address directly the sort of SKU-by-SKU rollout of Ampere.

We know that we didn’t have a ton of SKUs last quarter.

 

There were more in this quarter that you just announced.

Now, you’re doing sort of this refresh it sounds like with double the memory on the A100.

 

Is the T4 going to be refreshed?

And if so, when does that happen?

 

And, are there other, either systems or chips that are still waiting for the Ampere refresh that could potentially contribute to an extended cycle as we look at the next year?



Jensen Huang

Yes.

 

In terms of the total number of SKUs that we’ve ramped of Ampere, we’re probably somewhere along a third to a half of the SKUs at this point, maybe a little bit less.

Yes, it’s less.

 

The way that you could think through it, you could reverse engineer it, it is like this.

You know what our gaming lineup looks like for desktops.

 

And so, traditionally, we try to have a new architecture in every single segment.

And we’ve not gone below 499 yet.

 

And so, there’s a very big part of the marketplace that we’re still in the process of addressing.

And then, the second thing is laptops.

 

None of the Ampere architecture has launched for laptops.

And then, there’s workstations.

 

And you do the same thing with desktops and workstations and laptops workstations.

And none of those have gone out yet.

 

And then, there’s data center.

And our data center business for cloud, you’ve seen some of the early versions of it, A100.

 

But, then, there’s cloud computing for graphics, there’s cloud gaming.

For those enterprise, edge enterprise applications, enterprise data analytics applications.

 

And so, there’s a fair number of exciting new products we still have in front of us.

This was a terrific quarter.

NVIDIA is firing on all cylinders.

 

And the RTX has reinvented graphics and has made real-time ray tracing the standard of next generation content, creating the best ever reason to upgrade for hundreds of millions of NVIDIA gamers.

AI, where software writes software no humans can, is the most powerful technology force of our time and is impacting every industry.

 

NVIDIA AI again swept MLPerf training and now inference as well, extending our leadership in this important new way of doing computing.

NVIDIA AI’s new Triton inference server, a platform that I will speak a lot more about in the future and a lot more frequently because it’s important, and our full stack optimized platform are gaining rapid adoption to operate many of the world’s most popular AI-enhanced services, opening a major growth opportunity.

 

Data centers are the new unit of computing.

Someday, we believe there will be millions of autonomous data centers distributed all over the globe.

 

NVIDIA’s BlueField DPU programmable data center on a chip and our rich software stack will help place AI data centers in factories, warehouses, 5G base stations and even on wheels.

And with our pending acquisition of Arm, the company that builds the world’s most popular CPU, we will create the computing company for the age of AI, with computing extending from the cloud to trillions of devices.

Satya Nadella

Thank you, Brett.

 

It was a record quarter powered by our continued strength of our commercial cloud.

Over a year into the pandemic, digital adoption curves aren't slowing down.

 

In fact, they're accelerating and it's just the beginning.

Digital technology will be the foundation for resilience and growth over the next decade.

 

We are innovating and building the cloud stack to accelerate the digital capability of every organization on the planet.

Now, I'll highlight our growing opportunity and momentum starting with Azure.

 

As the world's COGS become more digital, computing will become more ubiquitous and decentralized.

We are building Azure to address organizations' needs in a multi-cloud multi-edge world.

 

We have more data center regions than any other provider, including new regions in China, Indonesia, Malaysia as well as United States.

Azure has always been hybrid by design and we are accelerating our innovation to meet customers where they are.

 

Azure Arc extends the Azure control plane across on-premise, multi-cloud, and the edge and they're going further with Arc-enabled machine learning and Arc-enabled Kubernetes.

Companies like Fujitsu and KPMG are using Arc to simplify hybrid management and run Azure data services anywhere.

 

Our differentiation across the cloud and the edge is driving deeper and more strategic partnerships with leading companies in every industry from Total and Repsol and Energy to Kaiser Permanente in healthcare and Amadeus in travel.

Now to data and analytics.

 

Core to the competitiveness of every company going forward will be their ability to turn data into predictive and analytical power.

The next-generation analytics service, Azure Synapse, accelerates time to insight by bringing together, data integration, enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics into one unified service.

 

No other provider offers the limitless scale, price performance and deep integrations of Synapse.

With Spark integration, for example, organizations can handle large-scale data processing workloads.

 

With Azure machine learning, they can build advanced AI models.

With Power BI, anyone in the organization can access insights.

 

We are seeing adoption from thousands of customers, including AB InBev, Dentsu and Swiss Re.

Queries performed using Synapse have increased 105% over the last quarter alone.

 

We are leading in hyperscale SQL and non-SQL databases to support the increasing volume variety and velocity of data.

Customers continue to choose Azure for their relational database workloads with SQL Server on Azure VMs use, up 129% year-over-year.

 

And Cosmos DB is the database of choice for cloud-native app development at any scale.

Transaction volume increased 170% year-over-year.

 

Now on to developers.

As every organization looks to build its own digital capability, they will need to modernize existing apps, build new apps and have a standard way of doing both.

 

We offer the most popular tools to help developers rapidly grow from idea to code and code to cloud.

Visual Studio has more than 25 million monthly active users and GitHub is home to nearly 65 million developers.

 

Over the past 12 months, the number of monthly active organizations using GitHub increased 70%.

In fact, some of the most groundbreaking technological achievements of the past year, including critical COVID-19 vaccine trials, as well as the first powered flight on Mars were only possible because of the contributions of the open-source communities on GitHub.

 

At the PaaS layer, we are innovating to help developers infuse AI into the solutions they build.

Large-scale AI models are becoming platforms and we've seen dramatic advances in research and development by OpenAI whose models are trained and hosted exclusively on Azure.

 

GPT-3 is generating 4.5 billion words per day on average with hundreds of apps in production across a range of industries.

With Azure Cognitive Services, organizations can build applications that see, hear, speak, search, understand and accelerate decision-making.

 

New capabilities enable developers to add semantic search to their apps and help companies like AT&T, Duolingo and Progressive build custom neural voices for their products.

And we're doing -- going further with Azure Percept, a complete platform from silicon to service, which simplifies the process of developing, training and deploying AI at the edge.

 

As the virtual and physical worlds converge, the metaverse comprised of digital twins, simulated environments and mixed reality is emerging as a first-class platform.

We are leading and seeing traction across public and private sector.

 

Bentley Systems is building a digital twin of the city of Dublin to reimagine urban planning used our Azure Digital Twins as well as Azure IoT.

PepsiCo is simulating its manufacturing processes to improve product consistency using our autonomous systems platform.

 

And from Airbus and Toyota to L'Oreal and Intel, customers in every industry are transcending space and addressing complex challenges using mixed reality.

The U.S.

 

Army, for example, will use HoloLens-based headset augmented with our cloud services.

The new Microsoft Mesh builds on this momentum allowing for holographic interactions with true presence in a natural way on any device.

 

We've already seen early adoption by Accenture, which is using mesh to build immersive virtual office experiences.

Power Platform is becoming the next-generation business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts in all functions.

 

We have taken a unique approach to what is an expansive and high-growth TAM, bringing together robotic process automation, low-code, no-code tools, virtual agents and business intelligence.

Using power platform and domain -- any domain experts can automate a workflow, create an app, build a virtual agent or analyze data rapidly driving productivity gains across the organization through smart automation.

 

Just like Office-revolutionized productivity gains for knowledge workers, Power Platform will do the same for domain experts.

All up Power, Platform is being used by nearly 16 million monthly active users, up 97% year-over-year.

 

Revenue increased 84% year-over-year.

Telstra, T-Mobile, Toyota North America and Unilever have all built centers of excellence for Power Platform with thousands of workers who are using those low-code, no-code tools to build apps and workflows for everything from COVID-19 screening to product quality control.

 

In robotic process automation, Coca-Cola saved months of development time by integrating Power Automate with legacy systems to automate shipment verification, payroll processing and much more.

And in analytics, Daimler chose Power BI to surface insights across the organization, while maintaining the highest levels of security.

 

Now on to business applications.

Dynamics 365 had a breakthrough quarter as companies turn to intelligent business applications to adapt and grow.

 

Revenue increased 45% as we continue to take share from competition.

We are adding capabilities across Dynamics 365 to address organization's most pressing challenges.

 

New integrations with Teams make it simple to meet, chat, call and collaborate directly within Dynamics 365.

A new Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management helps company’s support omnichannel fulfillment.

 

We are seeing increased adoption of Dynamics 365 across every industry from ABN AMRO in Financial Services to BMW in automotive.

More broadly across the Microsoft Cloud, we are leading with industry and cross-industry solutions and expanding our investments to help organizations use our complete tech stack along with industry specific customizations to improve time to value, increase agility and lower costs.

 

This quarter we introduced new industry clouds for financial services, manufacturing and nonprofits, building on the momentum of existing clouds for health care and retail.

And our pending acquisition of Nuance will bring our solutions directly into the physician patient loop, which is central to health care delivery.

 

Now on to LinkedIn.

We once again saw record engagement as LinkedIn's 756 million members use the network to connect, learn, create content, and find jobs.

 

Conversations increased 43%, content share was up 29%, and the hours on LinkedIn increased by 80%.

We are helping creators use LinkedIn to expand their economic opportunity, thousands of expert instructors are monetizing their content on LinkedIn Learning.

 

Freelancers can now attract clients with dedicated pages.

And with the creator mode, members can build a following and engaged communities.

 

In a world facing a growing skills gap, we are helping employers create feedback loops between skills, learning, credentials, and jobs.

60% of the Fortune 500 use LinkedIn Learning to skill and upskill their employees.

 

Nationwide Insurance, for example, is using LinkedIn Learning to provide personalized curriculum to 26,000 associates.

And new tools bring together courses with skills assessments helping companies like BlackRock, Gap and TaskRabbit source job candidates based on proven proficiencies.

 

Businesses continue to turn to LinkedIn as the trusted way to reach professionals ready to do business.

LinkedIn Marketing Solutions revenue was up more than 60% year-over-year.

 

Over the past 12 months revenue has surpassed $3 billion and is growing nearly three times faster than the B2B digital advertising market.

Now on to Microsoft 365 and Teams.

 

Hybrid work will require a new operating model.

That's why we built Teams as the organizing layer for all the way people work, learn, and collaborate.

 

Teams now has over 145 million daily active users, almost double the number a year ago.

In markets where employees have returned to the workplace including Australia, China, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan we have seen usage continue to grow.

 

And the number of organizations with more than 1,000 users integrating their third-party and line of business applications with Teams has increased nearly 3x year-over-year.

We're accelerating our innovation, adding more than 300 features over the past year including more than a hundred new capabilities so far in 2021.

 

New inclusive meeting experience for hybrid work including custom gallery views enable anyone to be seen, heard and participate whether they are at-home, in a meeting room, at an office or on a factory floor.

And customers like GM and Sanofi are using Teams for unified communications including for voice.

 

Teams is extending beyond communications, creating an entirely new category of modern collaborative applications as organizations use Power Platform to build custom apps, bots and workflows within teams.

American Airlines, for example, highlighted in their earnings call the cost savings it's driving by using a Power app within Teams to help their frontline workers manage critical data operations.

 

Teams is transforming not only internal collaboration, but companies how they do business.

We added support for shared workspaces with people outside the organization and we are seeing Teams used for everything from virtual retail showrooms and personal shopping to interactive webinars.

 

We introduced Microsoft Viva this quarter creating a new market category for employee experience.

Viva brings together knowledge, learning, communication and insights in an integrated experience directly within Teams and Microsoft 365.

 

Companies like Coca-Cola and Unilever will use Viva to help their employees thrive in a new era of hybrid work.

All up Microsoft 365 users generated more than 38 billion collaboration minutes in a single day this quarter.

 

Office 365 now has nearly 300 million paid seats.

And organizations across the private and public sector like the City of Helsinki, Bausch Health, Stryker are increasingly choosing our premium offerings for advanced security, compliance voice and analytics.

 

People are turning to Windows PCs more than ever to stay connected productive and secure.

Windows 10 now has more than 1.3 billion monthly active devices and Microsoft 365 consumer surpassed 50 million subscribers for the first time.

 

Now on to security.

The threat landscape has never been more complex or challenging and security has never been more critical to our customers.

 

This is driving increased demand for our end-to-end capabilities across identity, security compliance and management backed by cloud-scale AI and human expertise encompassing all clouds and all platforms.

What differentiates us and drives customer value is the interconnection between identity endpoint apps, cloud data and infrastructure across our cloud-native XDR and SIEM.

 

All informed by our operational security posture, which analyzes more than eight trillion signals each day.

Our approach enables organizations to adopt a Zero Trust architecture, while also reducing the complexity cost and risk created by stitching together point solutions.

 

That's why more than 400,000 customers use our offerings including many of the world's most established firms like Boston Consulting Group, HCA Healthcare, Lowe's and UBS.

And Signal is using Azure Confidential Computing to protect the data and use for its millions of customers.

 

We are going further to help protect organizations.

We are delivering on our ambition to eliminate passwords introducing password-less sign-in to Azure AD.

 

Our Azure AD paid customer base has more than doubled year-over-year to over 300,000, new capabilities in Microsoft 365 Defender help organizations better understand, prevent and mitigate active threats.

Defender has blocked 30 billion threats on e-mail and nearly seven billion on endpoints over the past 12 months alone.

 

And our compliance manager now offers more than 300 out-of-the-box assessments for regulations such as GDPR.

Now on to gaming.

 

We're expanding our opportunity as we help both gamers and creators play, connect and build across communities on any device.

People are turning to Xbox more than ever to play and chat with friends and we saw record engagement this quarter led by the strength on and off console.

 

With Game Pass we are redefining how games are distributed played and viewed.

Just last week we added cloud gaming via the browser expanding our reach across PC and mobile.

 

Content is the flywheel behind the services growth.

And upon the closing of our acquisition of ZeniMax Media this quarter we made 20 of the world's most iconic and beloved games accessible via Game Pass with more to come.

 

As games evolve into metaverse economies, we are building new tools to help anyone sell creations on our platform.

Minecraft is nearly 140 million monthly active users up 30% year-over-year making it one of the leading platforms in the creator economy.

 

Creators have generated over $350 million from more than one billion downloads of mods, add-ons and other experiences in Minecraft.

This is not counting and including activity outside of our marketplace.

 

We are also seeing a vibrant marketplace emerge in Flight Simulator with partners now able to sell content directly within the game.

In closing, we're innovating across the entire tech stack as we differentiate and lead in areas that will be critical to the success of every customer going forward.

 

I'm optimistic about our opportunity ahead.

With that I'll hand it over to Amy who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook and I look forward to rejoining you for questions.

 



Amy Hood

Thank you, Satya and good afternoon everyone.

 

My comments today reflect the impact of the ZeniMax acquisition for approximately three weeks this quarter as well as our outlook.

There is no impact from the Nuance acquisition that is expected to close by the end of the calendar year.

 

Our third quarter revenue was $41.7 billion, up 19% and 16% in constant currency and earnings per share was $1.95 and increased 39% and 34% in constant currency when adjusted for the tax benefit related to the recent India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes.

Many trends across industries, customer segments, and geographical markets continued to improve, which coupled with strong execution by our sales and partner teams, drove another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth.

 

In our commercial business accelerating digital transformation enabled by our unique Microsoft Cloud value, drove healthy demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings.

Strong Azure consumption, increased platform commitments, and higher usage of Teams Power Platform and our security offerings were key beneficiaries.

 

Within our small and medium business customer segment, continued improvement in cloud purchasing trends more than offset transactional licensing weakness.

And in LinkedIn's Talent Solutions business, annual contracts and job postings improved with the job market.

 

In our consumer business, Windows OEM and Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions benefited from a much stronger than expected PC market despite significant ongoing constraints in the supply chain.

Improvement in the advertising market again benefited our Search and LinkedIn businesses and in gaming, we continue to see record engagement and strong monetization across our platform as well as demand that significantly exceeded supply for Xbox Series X and S consoles.

 

Moving to our overall results, commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations increasing 39% and 38% in constant currency on a growing expiration base and low prior year comparable.

Growth was driven by consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and an increase in the number of larger long-term Azure contracts.

 

As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 31% and 32% in constant currency to $117 billion with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within and the portion beyond the next 12 months and our annuity mix increased two points year-over-year to 94%.

Commercial cloud revenue also better than expected grew 33% and 29% in constant currency to $17.7 billion.

 

Commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded three points year-over-year to 70%, driven by the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets.

Excluding this impact, commercial cloud gross margin percentage was up slightly with improvement in Azure gross margin mostly offset by sales mix shift to Azure.

 

With a weaker US dollar, FX increased revenue growth by approximately three points about one point more favorable than anticipated.

FX increased COGS and operating expense growth by approximately two points, both in line with expectations.

 

Gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency.

Gross margin percentage was 69% relatively unchanged year-over-year with roughly one point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate noted earlier.

 

Excluding this impact, company gross margin percentage was down, driven by strong revenue growth in cloud and gaming that resulted in sales mix shift.

Operating expense increased 5% and 3% in constant currency, lower than anticipated, primarily driven by investments that shifted to future quarters.

 

Overall, company headcount grew again this quarter up 12% year-over-year, reflecting our focused investments across key areas like cloud engineering, sales, and customer deployment.

Year-over-year growth in operating expense includes roughly two points of impact from continued COVID-related savings.

 

Operating income increased 31% and 27% in constant currency and operating margins expanded four points year-over-year to 41% including nearly two points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate and roughly one point of favorable impact from COVID-related savings.

Now to our segment results.

 

Revenue from productivity and business processes was $13.6 billion and grew 15% and 12% in constant currency, primarily driven by Office 365 and LinkedIn.

Office Commercial revenue grew 14% and 10% in constant currency.

 

Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 22% and 19% in constant currency, again driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU.

Demand for our high-value security, compliance and voice offerings drove strong momentum in E5 again this quarter.

 

Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 15% year-over-year to nearly $300 million with acceleration to the cloud in our small and medium business segment and a recovery in growth in our first-line worker offerings.

The accelerated cloud adoption, negatively impacted Office Commercial licensing, which declined 25% and 27% in constant currency, a bit below expectations.

 

In Office Consumer, revenue grew 5% and 2% in constant currency, slightly below expectations, primarily due to transactional weakness in Japan.

Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions grew to $50.2 million, up 27% year-over-year.

 

Dynamics revenue grew 26% and 22% in constant currency, better than expected, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth accelerating to 45% and 40% in constant currency with particular strength in Power Apps in our finance and operations offering.

LinkedIn revenue increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, ahead of expectations.

 

Our Marketing Solutions business accelerated again this quarter to 64% revenue growth.

Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 12% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year with nearly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate.

 

Operating expense increased 4% and 2% in constant currency and operating income increased 26% and 20% in constant currency including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate.

Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment.

 

Revenue was $15.1 billion, ahead of expectations, increasing 23% and 20% in constant currency.

Server products and cloud services revenue increased 26% and 23% in constant currency, ahead of expectations.

 

Azure revenue grew 50% and 46% in constant currency, better than anticipated, driven by continued strength in our consumption-based business.

And in our per user business growth in our Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base accelerated again this quarter, up 30% to over 174 million seats.

 

And on a strong prior year comparable that benefited from the end of support for Windows Server 2008, our on-premise's server business increased 3% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with strong annuity performance, driven by continued customer preference for our hybrid and premium offerings.

Enterprise Services revenue grew 10% and 8% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance in Microsoft Consulting Services.

 

Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% to 24% in constant currency.

Gross margin percentage increased 2 points year-over-year with roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate.

 

Operating expense increased 12% and 10% in constant currency and operating income grew 41% and 36% in constant currency with roughly 7 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate.

Now to More Personal Computing.

 

Revenue was $13 billion increasing 19% and 16% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance in gaming, Windows OEM and Search.

In Windows, the stronger PC market resulted in overall OEM revenue growth of 10%, driven by continued customer demand.

 

OEM non-Pro revenue grew 44% and OEM Pro revenue declined 2% on a prior year comparable that included the end of support for Windows 7.

Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 10% and 7% in constant currency with a lower-than-expected mix of in-quarter recognition from multiyear agreements.

 

In Surface, revenue grew 12% and 7% in constant currency lower than expected, primarily due to execution challenges in the commercial segment.

Search revenue ex TAC increased 17% and 14% in constant currency benefiting from the improved advertising market noted earlier.

 

And in Gaming, revenue increased 50% and 48% in constant currency.

Xbox hardware revenue grew 232% and 223% in constant currency driven by our new consoles.

 

Xbox content and services revenue, which now includes ZeniMax grew 34% and 32% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance of first-party titles, particularly Minecraft.

Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 11% in constant currency.

 

Gross margin percentage decreased two points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to gaming.

Operating expense decreased 3% and 4% in constant currency and operating income grew 27% and 22% in constant currency.

 

Now back to total company results.

Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6 billion in line with expectations driven by ongoing investment to support growing global demand from increased customer usage of our cloud services.

 

Cash paid for PP&E was $5.1 billion.

Cash flow from operations was $22.2 billion and increased 27% year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections.

 

Free cash flow was $17.1 billion, up 24%.

Other income and expense was $188 million higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments.

 

As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio.

Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 14%.

 

And finally, we returned $10 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

Now let's move to the outlook.

 

As a reminder in Q4, we begin to see growth rates that reflect the first full quarter impact of COVID-19 a year ago both across revenue and operating expenses.

Last year across Windows, OEM, Gaming and Surface we saw surges in purchasing and usage that will negatively impact Q4 growth rates.

 

In our Search and LinkedIn businesses, Q4 growth rates will be positively impacted given the advertising and job markets a year ago.

And in our transactional business, the slowdown in purchasing in Office and Server last year will benefit Q4 growth rates, particularly in our small and medium business segment.

 

Next in our largest quarter of the year, we expect the accelerating trends Satya discussed, our differentiated market position and continued solid execution to results in another strong quarter.

Growth in commercial bookings should again be healthy, but impacted by a declining expiry base.

 

As always, an increasing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing can drive quarterly volatility in bookings.

Commercial cloud gross margin percentage should increase roughly four points year-over-year with less than two points from the change in accounting estimate.

 

As a reminder, the favorable impact continues to lessen over time.

Excluding the accounting change, Q4 gross margin percentage will also benefit a bit from investments we made a year ago to support increased usage needs in remote work scenarios.

 

Longer term commercial cloud gross margin percentage will continue to be impacted by revenue mix shift to Azure, increased usage of our productivity and collab solutions and ongoing strategic investments to support our customers' success.

In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services.

 

Now to FX.

Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total company Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately three points, More Personal Computing revenue and total operating expense growth by approximately two points and COGS growth by approximately one point.

 

Next to our segment guidance.

In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $13.8 billion and $14.05 billion.

 

In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy seat growth and upsell opportunity to E5.

In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the high teens consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud.

 

In Office consumer, we expect mid to high teens revenue growth driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions against the low prior year comparable impacted by the transactional purchasing weakness noted earlier.

In LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-30% range, driven by continued strong engagement on the platform and improvements in the advertising and job markets.

 

And in Dynamics, continued momentum in Dynamics 365 will drive revenue growth similar to last quarter.

For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $16.2 billion and $16.45 billion.

 

In Azure, revenue will again be driven by strong growth in our consumption-based business.

And our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect some moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base.

 

In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium annuity offerings against a low prior year comparable and the transactional purchasing noted earlier.

And in Enterprise Services, revenue growth to be roughly in line with last quarter.

 

In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $13.6 billion and $14 billion.

In Windows, overall revenue should grow mid-single digits driven by Windows Commercial products and cloud services growth and continued demand for PCs, partially offset by ongoing supply chain impacts and the comparable noted earlier.

 

In Surface on a strong prior year comparable, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-teens as we work through the supply chain and executing challenges noted earlier.

In Search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth in the mid-40s driven by improvements in the advertising market.

 

In gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single-digits.

Significant demand for the Xbox Series X and S will continue to be constrained by supply.

 

And on the strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid- to high single-digits.

Now back to company guidance.

 

We expect COGS of $13.7 billion to $13.9 billion and operating expense of $13.1 billion to $13.2 billion.

As a reminder, in operating expense in Q4, we will benefit from continued COVID-related savings as well as the prior year comparable, which included roughly four points of impact from a $450 million charge related to the realignment of our retail store strategy.

 

In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other.

And finally, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 16%.

 

Now I'd like to share some closing thoughts as we look to next fiscal year.

Overall, we have performed well through three quarters of our fiscal year in a challenging environment, and we fully expect a strong Q4 to lay the foundation for FY 2022.

 

We will, of course, continue to focus on delivering strong revenue growth in the short term.

But even more importantly, this year has reinforced the critical importance of investing boldly to capture the significant list of opportunities ahead of us.

 

Excellence in daily execution, coupled with a thoughtful vision for the future that creates value as well as opportunity for our customers globally will lead to long-term revenue and profit growth.

With that, Brett, let's go to Q&A.

 



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Amy.

 

We'll now move to Q&A.

Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question.

 

Operator, can you please repeat the instructions?
Operator

Absolutely.

 

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.

Please proceed with your question.

 



Keith Weiss

Excellent.

 

Thank you, guys, for taking the question and great quarter.

I guess this is a question both for Satya and Amy.

 

We're seeing these really great commercial bookings results come through 39% growth in the current quarter.

And Satya, you've been talking to us a lot about these more strategic deals and the acceleration of digital transformation.

 

Can you give us a little bit of color of what comes in these more strategic deals?

How does it change the dynamics of what types of solutions people are using for Microsoft, the scope of sort of how deeply you're getting into these customers and sort of how much of the IT budget you're getting?

 

And then maybe talk to us a little bit about the timeframe for which this comes into revenues.

What should our expectation be when you get one of these big strategic deals?

 

How long does it take to really ramp up this customer onto the broader Microsoft platform?



Satya Nadella

Thank you, Keith, for the question.

 

I think we feel very good both, I would say, of consumption and usage today, as well as, as you mentioned, the bookings because both of those at any given point in time is what we look at.

The overall approach to the Microsoft Cloud, if you look at the breadth of what any customer may be doing with us, they may be doing hybrid cloud infrastructure with us.

 

They may be, for the first time, doing Tier 1 workloads on the cloud with us, right, whether it's in core financials or in retail or in health care.

Also they could be deploying their centers of excellence around Power Platform.

 

And Power Platform sits at the intersection of pretty much Dynamics, Azure and Teams, for example.

And of course, we're seeing the growth of Teams and Teams, as I've always maintained, is not just about one thing.

 

It's not about just meetings or it's not about just chat.

But most importantly, it's a platform that drives in fact line of business and business application termination inside of a collaboration workflow.

 

And so that's what we're seeing.

And then the other thing I would say that we are now seeing is also that industry level differentiation of the all-up Microsoft cloud.

 

So whether it's in retail, whether it's in healthcare or in financial services, we feel that we now can bring the power of the entire cloud together in a much more strategic way.



Amy Hood

And maybe just to build on what Satya was saying, Keith, if you think about bookings or the remaining performance obligation, what I tend to think of is, when you hear those words, I think, often we pivot toward these Azure contracts we talk a lot about because they create some volatility.

 

But really, the foundation for these long-term strategic contracts is the Microsoft Cloud holistically.

So what you'll see is not just Office 365, but the suite of Microsoft 365.

 

You'll see higher-level additions of security or compliance workloads.

You'll see Dynamics 365 as a pillar with Power Platform, because they're spanning end-to-end industry solutions to combine it back to what Satya is saying.

 

So you see it add a good bookings number, which is fundamentally about, do you renew what's up for renewal, do you add workloads, do you add users and do you -- and does it have a component of an Azure commitment.

All of those things together are what creates this change.

 

And if you look at remaining performance obligation, you see there a good bit of it, that's going to be recognized in the next 12 months and another equally balanced portion that's beyond that.

So it's not all long-term.

 

This transition happens quickly, usage builds, it's both per user, it's also for workload and it's consumptive based.

So it's really a more holistic view that I would have people take as opposed to thinking about an Azure contract as long dated.

 



Keith Weiss

Okay, Amy.

 

Thank you, guys.



Brett Iversen

Operator, next question, please?

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

The next question is from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.

Please proceed with your question.

 



Brent Thill

Thanks.

 

Satya, on healthcare, if you could just frame your aspirations long-term, where you'd like to be in this industry?

And if you could just comment on where you still think the lowest hanging fruit is as it relates to the opportunity set, specifically building on the Nuance acquisition?

 



Satya Nadella

Sure, Brent.

 

Thanks for the question.

When I look at the industry cloud opportunities, we think of healthcare is a very critical opportunity for us and a huge and expansive addressable market.

 

If you think about as a percentage of GDP, obviously, healthcare is significant.

And fundamentally, when I think about the provider market, in particular, digital tech is going to play a huge role for every provider to do the things that they care the most about, which is improve the patient outcomes and reduce cost and reduce the burden on the physicians.

 

So that's where the Nuance acquisition is a great fit for us.

We've been partnered with them.

 

It also enhances our platform approach, Brent.

What we have always done has gone into an industry with a platform and an ecosystem approach.

 

For example, with Nuance, they've done a fantastic job of taking what's perhaps the most defining technology of our times, which is AI and applying it to healthcare, which is the most important application space.

And they've done that again by really partnering, partnering deeply with EMR systems and the rest of the healthcare ecosystem ultimately to benefit the providers.

 

And so we're really looking forward to that acquisition closing and we're already partnered with them in our cloud.

But this allows us to take that and integrate more deeply with what we're doing with Teams and some of our AI capabilities even more deeply.

 

And we think we can add a significant amount of value both to our partners in the healthcare ecosystem as well as most importantly to the providers.



Brent Thill

Thank you.

 



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Brent.

 

Operator, next question please.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question is from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.

Please proceed with your question.

 



Mark Moerdler

Thank you very much and again congratulations on the quarter and how well the company is executing.

 

I'd like to change gear a little bit and drill in a bit on the Dynamics 365 business.

Frankly, was this part of any other company or even a standalone business, it would be such a center of enthusiasm by investors given how fast it's grown.

 

Satya, when you said Dynamics 365 is taking share from competitors, are you talking about ERP or CRM or is it both?

Or is it something different?

 

And what are the key drivers of that strength and growth?

And how sustainable do you believe that is?

 

Thank you.



Satya Nadella

Thanks so much for the question, Mark.

 

And first of all, we're very, very excited about what's happening again with Dynamics 365.

And when you ask where is the share coming and where is the growth coming?

 

It's coming from all those categories.

But the most interesting thing is, as somebody wants to deploy even an omni-channel solution, for example, in a world where what's physical and what is digital need to come together, unlike anything before because the pandemic is bringing about such structural change.

 

You need both, that federated inventory management, distributed inventory management system I referenced in my remarks.

And you need the customer insights product that is probably one of the fastest-growing modules, which is that 360-degree view on customers and customer engagement and then including the supply chain.

 

So bottom line is that, every customer is looking to digitize and bring together the data silos, in fact, silos of CRM and ERP systems.

And that's probably one of the most interesting things we have observed is, it's not about replacing even an existing ERP or an existing CRM, it's about buying Dynamics and helping them bridge even some of the disparate CRM and ERP systems they may have.

 

So we do see this, as a huge opportunity as the world modernizes and puts in a complete next-generation, more proactive versus reactive business systems.

And that's what Dynamics has been architected for.

 

So I feel like coming out of this pandemic and the architecture and all the hard work that team has done over the multiple years now, positions us very well.



Mark Moerdler

Thank you.

 

I much appreciate it.



Brett Iversen

Thanks Mark.

 

Operator, next question please.
Operator

Thank you.

 

The next question is from Karl Keirstead with UBS.

Please proceed with your question.

 



Karl Keirstead

Thanks.

 

Question for Amy on OpEx.

Amy the OpEx growth has been extraordinarily low the last several quarters.

 

The growth rate looks like it's going to inch up a little bit in the June quarter.

But you mentioned the investments are shifting to future quarters.

 

You probably don't want to give too much on fiscal 2022.

But I'm just wondering whether we should extrapolate that into thinking that OpEx growth in fiscal 2022 should get back to the pre-COVID levels of plus 10%.

 

And if you don't want to be that specific, maybe you could just help us outline some of the variables we should keep in mind as we model that line item post-COVID recovery in fiscal 2022?

Thank you.

 



Amy Hood

Thanks Karl.

 

And I do think in Q4, and its why, I specifically called out the four points of impact from a year ago because it does start to get to a more normalized rate in Q4.

And I say that, because our headcount growth which I noted earlier has been 12%.

 

And so, overall, you would expect, OpEx growth to at least marry your headcount growth over any period of time and we've certainly benefited through the year from COVID-related savings.

We'll continue to have that in Q4.

 

And as we get to 2022, I would expect to see a little less of that as people get back to the workplace at some level and resume some other normal levels of activity.

And so, I do think, you're heading in the right direction on that.

 

And listen, I think that type of growth with the type of opportunity we're seeing, the number of TAM expansive opportunities really Satya went through in his comments, where we feel like we've got a unique position and opportunity to take share.

I feel pretty confident in being able to certainly land that OpEx growth number.

 



Karl Keirstead

Got it.

 

Thank you, Amy.



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Karl.

 



Satya Nadella

I mean, I think just to add to it, Amy, I think I hope in all of your models you have new rows at least when we think about it from even just last year to this year, we are in many more new categories and in those categories with significant differentiation.

 

So when we think about OpEx, it's not about adding OpEx to the stuff that we had in the past.

It's -- there's leverage there.

 

In fact it's OpEx going into new TAMs.



Brett Iversen 

Operator, next question please.

 
Operator

Absolutely.

 

Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.

Please proceed with your question.

 



Kirk Materne

Yes.

 

Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter.

Satya, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about Viva.

 

I realize it's early days on that.

But just the kind of feedback you're getting on that product?

 

And how do you see that sort of fitting in?

There seem to be some nice adjacencies with Dynamics with Office 365.

 

So I was just kind of curious if you could give us a little bit of a hand on how it's going and sort of your excitement level about it over the next quarter next couple of years?

Thanks.

 



Satya Nadella

Thank you so much for the question.

 

It's speaks a lot.

It's very much a great example of what I was saying in terms of creating a new category right.

 

When I look back multiple years now, we started talking about Power Platform.

And as I said even in my script today, we now have a full suite of tools that essentially created this next-generation business, process automation and productivity suite in Power Platform that set scale and growing at scale.

 

Similarly, we think of the experience cloud as a distinct cloud opportunity for us.

It brings together even today what have been disparate tools, whether it's the knowledge mining and management systems in an enterprise, connecting it to learnings and ultimately the employee experience and communication system.

 

So we -- it obviously is a very massive adjacencies to what we're doing with Microsoft 365 and Office 365 in particular Teams.

But also to your point connects up with line of business systems, HRM systems and all of the other things we do in Dynamics as well as other third-party SaaS applications.

 

So it's very early days.

And so we'll take the same approach we have taken, whether it's in Security, whether it's in Power Platform, whether it's Dynamics and many other places where you've seen us grow substantial new businesses essentially as part of Microsoft Cloud.

 

But we're very excited about what this opportunity represents.



Kirk Materne

Thank you.

 



Brett Iversen 

Thanks, Kirk.

 

Operator, next question please.
Operator

Absolutely.

 

Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.

Please proceed with your question.

 



Kash Rangan

Hi.

 

Thank you very much.

Congratulations on the quarter.

 

Satya, I know, you've said that you expect tech as a percentage of GDP to track about 5% or roughly double over the next 10 years or so.

How should we think about Microsoft's share in that context?

 

Is it going to be steady?

Or do you see that expanding?

 

And if it is going to expand, what are the key products and markets that will drive your relative share growth as you outperform tech and as tech outperforms GDP.

Thank you so much.

 



Satya Nadella

No, thanks Kash for the question.

 

I think that, first of all, we are big believers in two things.

One is, we need to be competitive in each layer and then the coming together of each layer into a cohesive coherent architecture of the full stack or the Microsoft cloud creates that differentiation.

 

And that will define what we think is going to be increasing share for us, as tech itself as a percentage of GDP doubles.

So if you look at it -- whether it's on the hybrid infrastructure or the multi-cloud, multi-edge world, which I believe is going to be the world 10 years from now, we are very well positioned.

 

We have led in it we currently lead in it and we plan to continue that.

When it comes to data when I look at even what we've been able to do with Synapse even in the just last year and what that can do both at the cloud and the edge.

 

When it comes to AI what we are doing with OpenAI and our cognitive services or what we're doing with Power Platform.

Developer SaaS one of the most exciting things again, that I believe is the next 10 years is going to be about developers and the digital capability in every enterprise and we are the leaders there.

 

When you think about VS Code as well as GitHub.

And then, of course, all of the things that we're doing with Microsoft 365 and Dynamics on the industry side.

 

So, ultimately, we don't take anything for granted.

But that said, we're well positioned for what is expansive TAM and with competitive differentiation both in the individual layers of the stack as well as the cohesiveness of the stack itself.

 



Kash Rangan

Got it.

 

Thank you so much.

That just sound like a share gain story.

 

Thank you so much.

Appreciate it.

 



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Kash.

 

Operator, next question please.
Operator

Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho.

 

Please proceed with your question.



Gregg Moskowitz

Okay, very much for taking the question.

 

Satya, in your prepared remarks, you spoke about an increase in verticalization of Azure.

Can we double click on that a bit more?

 

How much incremental opportunity do you see in industries like financials, like manufacturing?

And are there other verticals that may make sense to more as we pursue over time as well?

 



Satya Nadella

Thank you for the question.

 

We absolutely think that ultimately, customers are looking to increase their time to value lower cost and improve agility.

So being able to customize these workflows, to come up with industry schemers because when you think about increased digitization and workflow automation, it does take that next level of schematization of what is perhaps today not digital inside an industry.

 

And so therefore, what we do by stitching together, coming together of even Microsoft 365, Teams, Power Platform with certain workflows, with data inside of Azure, as well as Dynamics, that absolutely improves the ability for any customer in any one of these industries to improve their time to value.

So yes, it is going to both help us with adoption rates increase, the speed with which it increases and it also differentiates us.

 

And we'll continue to look.

And one of the other things that we're doing is it's not just one industry at a time.

 

It's also the cross-industry workflows.

So we absolutely believe that that -- we already talk about not just any individual part of our cloud, we talk about only one thing, it's called the Microsoft Cloud.

 

And now we're increasingly talking about Microsoft Cloud by industry and cross industry.



Gregg Moskowitz

Very helpful.

 

Thank you.



Satya Nadella

Thanks Gregg.

 

Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator

Our final question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.

 

Please proceed with your question.



Raimo Lenschow

Hey, thanks for squeezing me in.

 

I wanted to ask about security and what we see in terms of changes of the industry and how Microsoft is kind of fit in there where, obviously in the last quarter, that was kind of a big topic.

Can you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of customers realizing the broadened offering from Microsoft and how the cloud is playing a changing role there?

 

Thank you.



Satya Nadella

No.

 

Thank you for the question.

Obviously, security is a super important topic for every customer, every board, every executive team.

 

And the fundamental approach we have is, how do we ensure that every customer has implemented a zero trust architecture.

But that's the name of the game which is, how can Microsoft through participation in the security industry, accelerate essentially the cyber defense of the entire digital factor and beyond.

 

And so to me, what we have done is taken a pretty unique approach of bringing identity, endpoint application, infrastructure all together with XDR and SIM, which is cloud native.

That's pretty unique because we really don't let the get in the way.

 

We'll make sure that any customer who is able to sort of deploy these systems together has more defense in depth, but also the aggregate data to be able to detect and respond to any intrusion because that's sort of the key posture.

And then you couple that with our operational security posture when you're processing 8 trillion events and using that to continuously help our customers is increasing to your point, the cloud adoption rate.

 

So if you look at some of the challenges like HAFNIUM, the cloud was not impacted.

And when we did sort of a lot of work to make sure that the patches were out even for servers that were out of support for multiple years.

 

And so -- but at the same time, any business that had moved already to the cloud had none of those issues.

So, therefore, I think we are going to see increased cloud adoption.

 

We're going to see increased usage of end-to-end security suites like what we offer.

And most importantly, great hygiene and great operational security posture all the time with zero trust architecture.

 



Raimo Lenschow

Thank you.

 



Brett Iversen

Thanks Raimo.

Albert Bourla

Thank you, Chris.

 

Hello, everyone.

I'm happy to report that Pfizer generated another solid performance in the third quarter recording 130% operational revenue growth compared with third quarter of 2020.

 

When excluding direct sales and alliance revenues provided by our COVID-19 vaccine, we generated 7% operational revenue growth compared with the previous year quarter.

We also are raising our 2021 total Company guidance for both revenues and adjusted EPS.

 

While we are proud of our financial performance, we're even more proud of these financial results -- of what these financial results represent in terms of the positive impact we are having on human lives around the world.

In the first nine months of 2021, our innovative medicines and vaccines reached nearly a billion people.

 

It's fair to say millions of lives have been saved because of this.

Excluding our COVID-19 vaccine, we reached nearly 300 million people during that time.

 

These are humbling numbers for all of us at Pfizer.

At the same time, we delivered to our shareholders the 331st consecutive quarterly dividend.

 

We also continue to advance our R&D pipeline.

Some key milestones include the first COVID-19 vaccine authorized for emergency use in the U.S.

 

for children 5 to 11 years of age.

The first patient dosed in our large Phase III RENOIR study for our RSV bivalent vaccine candidate and the initiation of Phase II/III studies for both IV and oral protease inhibitor candidates for COVID-19.

 

Let me start with commentary on some of our key growth drivers in the quarter.

The biggest of which was Comirnaty, which contributed $13 billion in global revenue during the third quarter.

 

Today, we have produced 2.6 billion doses and shipped 2 billion doses to 152 countries or territories.

So far, 75% of our Comirnaty revenues have been generated outside the U.S.

 

and we continue to sign agreements with governments around the world.

We also remain on track to produce 3 billion doses this year, of which at least 1 billion will go to middle- and low-income countries.

 

In addition, our weekly market set of COVID-19 vaccines administered continues to increase.

In the U.S., our four-week average market share increased from about 56% in April to about 74% as of October 31st.

 

And in the EU, it went from about 70% to about 80% during the same time period.

These market increases are primarily the result of our booster being the first to receive emergency use authorization, and our two-dose series being preferred by some countries around the world for use in certain younger populations.

 

We also continue to follow the science to help ensure we stay ahead of the virus.

Let me speak to two examples.

 

First, top line results from our Phase III randomized controlled trial demonstrated a booster dose administered to individuals, 16 years of age and older who previously received the Pfizer-BioNTech primary two-dose series, restored vaccine protection against COVID-19 to the high levels achieved after the second dose.

Second, the U.S.

 

Food and Drug Administration has authorized our COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use for children 5 through 11 years of age, the first and only vaccine to receive such authorization.

For this age group, the vaccine is to be administered in a two-dose regimen of 10 microgram doses given 21 days apart.

 

The 10-microgram dose level was carefully selected based on safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data.

Last week, we announced that the U.S.

 

government exercised its final purchase option under the existing U.S.

supply agreement to purchase 50 million additional doses of Comirnaty.

 

This brings the total number of pediatric doses purchased by the U.S.

government to 115 million, which is enough to vaccinate every U.S.

 

child.

Overall, the U.S.

 

has now purchased a total of 600 million doses across all age ranges under this supply agreement.

Now, let's take a look at some of the quarter's other key growth drivers.

 

Eliquis has continued to deliver strong performance with global revenues up 19% operationally to $1.3 billion in the third quarter.

In the U.S., sales growth for Eliquis was driven mainly by a 16% growth in prescription volume.

 

Vyndaqel and Vyndamax revenues were up 42% operationally to $501 million globally.

Our disease education efforts in the U.S.

 

continue to support increases in appropriate diagnosis.

While the main driver of growth in Japan has been the successful establishment of several referral networks in select areas resulting in new patient starts.

 

Ibrance continue outside of the U.S., revenues outside of the U.S.

were up 9% operationally to $500 million.

 

This growth was driven by accelerating demand as the delays in diagnosis and treatment initiations caused by COVID-19 show signs of recovery across several international markets.

Global revenues for Ibrance were up only 1% operationally as the international growth was largely offset by a 3% decline in the U.S.

 

The U.S.

decline was driven by an increase in the proportion of patients accessing Ibrance through our Patient Assistance Program.

 

We continue to be pleased with the performance of our Oncology Biosimilars Portfolio, which is now the largest in the industry with six biosimilars approved in the U.S.

for patients living with cancer.

 

Global revenues from this portfolio grew 51% operationally during the quarter to $398 million.

This growth was primarily driven by continued strong results from our U.S.

 

therapeutic monoclonal antibody launches.

In international developed markets, oncology biosimilars contributed 29% operational growth, driven by new launches of ZIRABEV and continued growth of TRAZIMERA.

 

Of course, with such a broad portfolio of life-changing and life-saving products, it will be uncommon to not have a few challenges.

U.S.

 

revenues for our Prevnar family, Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20, for example, were down 2%, primarily due to a 36% decline in the adult indication of Prevnar 13 due to the ongoing prioritization of primary and booster vaccination campaigns for COVID-19 and the later start of the flu season compared with last year.

Other contributing factors were the continued impact of the lower remaining unvaccinated eligible adult population and the June 2019 change to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the change of ACIP, recommendation for the Prevnar 13 adult indication to shared clinical decision-making.

 

Just two weeks ago, ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 20 for routine use to help protect adults against invasive disease and pneumonia caused by the 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes in the vaccine.

Specifically, the ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 20 for adults aged 65 and older, and adults aged 19 to 64 with certain risk conditions without the need to be followed by PPC V23 vaccination.

 

This recommendation recognizes for the first time the significance of helping protect more population under age 65 with comorbid and immunocompromising conditions who are at increased risk of disease against these 20 diseases causing serotypes.

This new one-dose regimen option, once endorsed by the CDC director, also will help simplify longstanding adult pneumococcal recommendations.

 

As a reminder, Prevnar 20 is the only vaccine the FDA has approved not only for invasive pneumococcal disease, but also for Pneumonia.

In September, I assume many of you saw that the FDA issued a drug safety communication related which completed review of the Xeljanz oral survey on trial.

 

We are in continuing dialogue with the FDA about its assessment and the resulting final context in Xeljanz label.

With this important step taken, we hope we are a step closer to having an update regarding the new drug application for abroticinib in atopic dermatitis, and the supplemental NDA for Xeljanz in [Indiscernible] both of which are currently under FDA review.

 

In terms of Xeljanz, it's currently approved indication in the U.S., we believe that Xeljanz prescribing behavior will adjust in the coming months based on the FDA's update, resulting in an initial correction in the short-term.

But based on the trends we have observed and the broad application of Xeljanz across its approved indications, we believe Xeljanz has the potential to return to growth.

 

Again, once the final risk label is issued and physicians have adjusted their prescribing habits accordingly as we go into 2022 and beyond.

[Indiscernible] received marketing authorization for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in both doses.

 

It also received a positive of being in adults from the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use.

We are hopeful this momentum will continue.

 

We have applications currently filed for review with regulators around the globe, including in the U.S.

and Australia.

 

Overall, we remain confident in the importance of the JAK inhibitor class for appropriate patients with inflammatory diseases, and they are pursuing a variety of options for advancing additional JAK inhibitor assets within our portfolio.

For example, Pfizer has granted an exclusive license to Brepocitinib and TYK2 both in Phase IIII development to a new Company, formed in collaboration with a partner that has a proven track record in late-stage inflammation and immunology drug development.

 

The new Company will direct all future development decisions while Pfizer will have a 25% stake and retain certain ex-U.S.

commercial rights for Brepocitinib and TYK2.

 

This transaction will enable the allocation of resources to advance development of Brepocitinib and TYK2 while allowing Pfizer to focus on diversifying its pipeline.

And either way, in which we are continuing to bolster our pipeline is through strategic business development agreements.

 

This slide highlights 10 such agreements we have entered into -- in recent years, spanning four different therapeutic areas.

To further build on our strength in cancer research, we acquired Array BioPharma.

 

The team in Boulder, Colorado has become a center of excellence for targeted therapies in not only cancer, but other diseases as well.

With an expected 1-2 new compounds entering the clinic every year.

 

Leveraging our strength in gene therapy, we entered into a collaboration with Vivet Therapeutics for a potential gene therapy for Wilson Disease, a rare genetic disorder that can cause severe hepatic damage, neurological symptoms, and potentially death.

Our acquisition of Therachon builds on our rare disease team's 30 years commitment to develop innovative medicines that address significant unmet medical needs of people with rare diseases.

 

Regarding our worldwide exclusive licensing agreement with Akcea, we believe our expertise and breadth of experience in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases makes us well suited to accelerate clinical development of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, an investigational antisense therapy being developed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.

We are excited about our collaboration with Valneva to develop and commercialize Valneva's Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15, the only active Lyme disease vaccine program in clinical development today.

 

Of course, our collaboration with BioNTech on the COVID-19 vaccine led to the first mRNA vaccine ever approved, and this relationship was born out of our companies' initial collaboration to develop an improved flu vaccine based on mRNA tech.

Building on our strengths in prostate cancer and women's health, we have entered into an agreement with Myovant.

 

Joined them in development and commercialize Orcovix Relugolix in advanced prostate cancer, and Relugolics combination tablet in women's health in the U.S.

and Canada.

 

Our global collaboration with our Arvinas to develop and commercialize RV 471 and investigational oral product estrogen receptor protein degrader built on our metastatic breast cancer franchise, allowing us to potentially go into earlier non-metastatic patients and add to efficacy of [Indiscernible] in a metastatic setting.

Trillium CD47, SIRP-Alpha focus technology has the potential to be a foundational in cancer immunotherapy as [Indiscernible] have been.

 

We look forward to that acquisition closing later this year and in the first half of 2022.

With pre approvals, four EUAs and multiple submissions in the readouts, these transactions are already bearing fruit and positioning us to reach even more pace.

 

Before I close, I want to welcome to the call Aamir Malik, who joined us in August as Executive Vice President and Chief Business Development -- and Chief Business Innovation Officer.

Aamir came to us from McKinsey, where during his 25-year career, he has developed growth strategies, guided mergers and acquisitions, and implemented large-scale programs to improve patients' lives and transform performance for life science companies.

 

This includes working closely with Pfizer on several strategic initiatives.

I have known Aamir for more than 50 years, and I'm certain he will be an incredible addition to Pfizer as we look to the next era of innovation.

 

Looking ahead, we continue to focus on driving operational excellence across the organization and pursuing the kinds of first-in-class science that will define the new Pfizer.

Given our Third Quarter performance and our current expectations for the near-term, we continue to expect a revenue CAGR of at least 6% on a risk-adjusted basis through the end of 2025 and double-digit growth on the bottom line.

 

I would remind you that these projections do not include any potential impact from Comirnaty, recent or subsequent business development activities, or potential future mRNA programs.

Rather, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve these growth rates because of the strength of our current product portfolio and R&D pipeline.

 

Now, I will turn it over to Mikael to speak more about our R&D efforts, and then Frank will provide financial details on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2021, which looks solid.

Mikael.

 



Mikael Dolsten

Thank you, Albert.

 

I appreciate the chance to share updates on Pfizer's robust R&D pipeline.

As the measure of the transformation that we've instituted in our R&D organization, we track our average clinical success rates against peers.

 

In every phase and in trend we achieved greater success rates than peer average in 2020, and have continued to sustain those higher rates in '21.

Today I will provide updates from our vaccines, rare disease, inflammation immunology portfolios, and on our overall protease inhibitor.

 

In several cases, I will reference publicly available data on other agents so that you can understand our enthusiasm about what we're seeing in our development program.

Of course, head-to-head clinical trials would be necessary to support any comparative claim.

 

Last Friday, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization for 5 to 11-year-old and the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is meeting today to discuss recommendation.

On the left, we show with the comparable immune response observed with 10 microgram dosing in children 5 through 11, compared to 30 microgram dosing in 16 to 25 year.

 

On the right, we show 90.7% vaccine efficacy observed.

This too, is comparable to what we have seen in older population.

 

The rate and severity of fever and chills of the first and second doses were less in the younger children than either adolescents or adults.

We believe that vaccinating younger children is one important step in making our way through this pandemic.

 

Looking ahead, we expect initial pivotal data from the studies in 2 to less than 5-years-old this quarter.

And in 6 months to less than 2-years old next quarter, with full data readouts to follow.

 

On the right, we show improved handling conditions that have been approved for vials to those 5 to 11-year olds.

Of note are the smaller pack sizes and the ability to refrigerate for up to 10 weeks.

 

We plan to submit data to regulators for potential approval of similar handling conditions for vials used to dose the 12 and older population.

We are the first manufacturer to report Phase III clinical efficacy data on a third dose boost and, to the best of our knowledge, are the only Company with an ongoing pivotal efficacy boost study.

 

In a study of participant 16 and older, shown on top, a booster demonstrated a relative vaccine efficacy of 95.6% compared to the original two-dose schedule during a period in which Delta was the prevalent strain, affirming the protective impact of the early immunological data which led to the EUA.

It's projected that the third dose boost vaccine efficacy is even higher compared to the unvaccinated population, potentially above 98%.

 

This assumes that vaccine efficacy for those vaccinated with two-doses versus unvaccinated is above 55% at this time point.

We observed consistent efficacy in younger and older adults.

 

While the majority of cases were in the older age group, as would be expected, we recorded a relative vaccine efficacy of 100% in individuals aged 16 to 30 years.

Data from Israel shown at the bottom and published by Professor Mark Lipsitch of Harvard and others in Lancet, showed that the third dose, protected individuals against severe COVID-19 related outcome.

 

We plan to monitor the participants in our clinical study, and at an appropriate time, consider a randomized fourth dose boost the study to document the impact of additional and possibly annual repeat vaccination.

This will be supplemented with real-world evidence data.

 

Countries have started to recognize the favorable risk-benefit profile of our vaccine.

In each country shown here, our vaccines recommended were the only one permitted in younger populations, and indicates of [Indiscernible] not restricted for boosting.

 

News over the weekend from another manufacturer suggest that their vaccine may not be available in the near-term for younger population.

We are encouraged by these science-driven decisions, which have helped make Comirnaty one of the most used COVID-19 vaccines globally.

 

Next, gene therapy.

In hemophilia A, we have temporarily and voluntarily paused screening and dosing in our Phase III study evaluating Factor VIII gene therapy, which we're developing with Sangamo, in order to implement a protocol amendment following their observance of Factor VIII levels greater than 150% in some trial participants.

 

To date, no patient has experienced a [Indiscernible] event and some patients are being treated with oral anticoagulant to reduce the risk of thrombosis.

We are committed to resuming dosing as quickly as possible once the protocol amendment, which is intended to provide guidelines for clinical management of elevated Factor VIII levels is implemented.

 

Separately based on recent interaction with the FDA, Pfizer no longer plans to conduct an interim analysis of Phase III data from our EMA and B gene therapy programs.

We anticipate pivotal data readout to be based on full analysis of at least 50 study participants for EMA and 40 participants for the hemophilia B program.

 

This will push out the timing of readout of those trial compared to our previous expectation.

For Hem A, we're working to evaluate the impact of both the FDA feedback as well as the protocol amendment on timelines and we'll share an update at the appropriate time.

 

For hemophilia B, we anticipate a readout in the First Quarter of '23.

We continue to collect long-term fall updates in our Phase 1b DMD study, in which 19 ambulatory boys in the U.S.

 

have been treated and plan to represent the 1-year dataset at a scientific meeting.

We recently shared information on muscle weakness, [Indiscernible].

 

In some cases, with [Indiscernible] in three participants in Phase III ambulatory trial with a specific subset of dystrophin truncation notation.

They were treated with higher doses of steroids and all improved within a few weeks, were discharged from the hospital and have recovered or are still recovering.

 

The Data Monitoring Committee have confirmed that immunological assessment performed in the trial support the hypothesis that the immune response against the immunity's [Indiscernible] protein [Indiscernible] This type of reaction is a risk potentially inherent of any gene replacement therapy, and similar severe adverse events report in other programs to support the notion that is since classified.

We have proposed the protocol change to exclude patients with [Indiscernible] affecting X-somes 9 through 13 inclusive or a deletion that affect both X-somes 29 and 30.

 

A few sites have resumed new patients’ activities and we anticipate that nearly all ex-U.S.

trial sites will have restarted clinical activity by the end of this month.

 

These mutations are estimated to represent less than 15%, 15 of patients with DMD.

We recognized the devastating impact the DMD has on this boy and their families and plan to include patients with some of these excluded mutations in future study.

 

In addition, we continue to work with FDA to address outstanding R&D questions related to the Phase III studies, including technical aspects of our potency assay matrix.

We have made considerable progress with development of the [Indiscernible] as per FDA guidance, and are now in an active phase of filing this update.

 

While we cannot speculate as to when site may open, we're working to reach alignment with the FDA as soon as possible.

In addition, we have 12 pre-clinical gene therapy programs and are anticipating approximately 1-2 [Indiscernible] each year.

 

We'll now turn to a high potency PDE4 plus immune modulator, we are exploring in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.

Topical delivered high potency PDE4 plus inhibition may offer differentiated efficacy and safety profile compared to other mechanism of action whether used orally or topically.

 

PDE4 inhibition could provide both rapid and deep responses versus other agents, with the potential for further improvement at higher doses.

Even at a significant lower dose, we observed promising clinical efficacy compared to what we have seen with PDE4 topicals in other trials.

 

We expect to initiate Phase 2b studies in both diseases in 2022, exploring higher doses.

On the left, we show in vitro potency at the low dose versus Roflumilast and Crisaborole.

 

Our assets demonstrated approximately 240-fold greater inhibition of IL-4 and approximately 25-fold great inhibition of IL-13 versus Roflumilast.

On the right, we observed the clinical and significant improvement in excema area severity versus comparatives in other studies, with a 45% reduction from baseline at Week 6.

 

Our assets show stronger or similar efficacy at Week 6 as compared to reported data from another study at Week 8 with the recently approved topical JAK 12 inhibitor Ruxolitinib.

There was no stinging observed at application site.

 

On the left, we saw an approximately 80% reduction in IL-23 versus activated skin [Indiscernible] vehicle in an in vitro skin model.

This displays a relevant mechanism of action for high potency DD4 plus in psoriasis.

 

On the right, patients we saw significant clinical improvement in psoriasis area and severity versus a comparator in a separate study with a 4.5-point reduction from baseline at Week 6.

Let's turn to a TL1A inhibitor, which targets a newly identified member of the TNFs super family being explored for ulcerative colitis.

 

In a Phase 2a study, we saw a promising endoscopic improvement.

Based on the benefit risk profile seen, there's a potential for TL1A inhibition to be used earlier in the treatment paradigm.

 

Phase 2b studies inflammatory bowel disease is ongoing with estimated primary completion in the Fourth Quarter of '22.

On the left, our TL1A inhibitor demonstrated greater endoscopic improvement than what Tofacitinib demonstrated in a similar trial with 34% of patients responding at Week 14.

 

We matched the population based on the characteristic of those involved in our TL1A study using propensity score matching.

The Week 4 [Indiscernible] Tofacitinib is interpolated based on Week 8 data of the induction study and Month 12 data from the maintenance and open-label studies.

 

On the right, a post-talk analysis found that 48% of patients who had biomarkers achieved endoscopic improvement versus 13% of patients who were biomark negative.

Approximately 70% of patients were positively biomarker and we believe a precision medicine approach utilizing key biomarkers may enhance patient selection and improve patient outcomes.

 

Next, it's an [Indiscernible] base inhibitor, a potential breakthrough therapy for dermatomyositis that we develop in a research collaboration with Mass Gen Brigham.

This is a disease with very limited treatment option.

 

In an ongoing Phase II clinical trial, we have observed significant reduction in clinical disease activity in skin compared to placebo.

We anticipate the readout of the full Phase II study in the First Quarter of '22.

 

On the left, in this figure, treatment compared -- demonstrated an 83.6 decrease in gene signature scores from baseline at Week 12 compared to 11.8 with placebo.

On the right, treatment also showed significant decrease in clinical disease activity at Week 12 compared to placebo.

 

An important step in addressing the pandemic will be the availability of effective outpatient treatments for people who acquired COVID-19.

In a paper published today in science, we share the design and pre-clinical profile of our novel investigational oral protease inhibitor, including its industrial pan-coronavirus antiviral activity, in vivo efficacy, selectivity and pre-clinical safety profile.

 

A robust program to study the breadth of both treatment and prevention in high risk, standard risk, and household contact populations is well underway.

Projected pivotal readouts start potentially this quarter and extend through mid '22.

 

Finally, our recent milestones are a reflection of those high clinical success rates that are shared at the beginning, and we look forward to continuing the momentum in '22.

Select milestones expected in the Fourth Quarter include a pivotal data readout for our C.

 

difficile candidates, a proof-of-concept readout for [Indiscernible] for severe hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular risk reduction.

And a proof of concept readout for [Indiscernible] or diabetes.

 

Milestones expected in the first half of 2022 include Phase III results for our RSV adult and maternal vaccine candidate.

A potential pivotal Phase II results for [Indiscernible] in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma.

 

A proof-of-concept readout for our mRNA flu vaccine candidate a phase to be proof-of-concept readout for the potential Lyme disease vaccine on which we are collaborating with Valneva.

A proof-of-concept readout for ROBO2 FC or focal segmental [Indiscernible], a proof of concept readout for Danuglipron for obesity, and Phase III results of Talzenna and Xtandi in first-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

 

In addition, we expect continued active business development to further augment the clinical portfolio.

Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your questions.

 

Now, let me turn it over to Frank.



Frank D’amelio

Thanks, Mikael.

 

I know you've seen our release, so let me provide a few highlights regarding the financials.

The COVID-19 vaccine, once again, had a significant positive impact on our quarterly results and Albert has already addressed the key points on the COVID-19 landscape.

 

Turning to the income statement, revenue increased to a 130% operationally in the Third Quarter of 2021, driven by COVID-19 vaccine sales and strong performance from a number of our other key growth drivers.

And looking at the revenue growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine contribution from direct sales and Alliance revenues as Albert said earlier, we saw a continuation of solid performance from the businesses again this quarter, delivering 7% operational revenue growth despite a negative 5% impact from price.

 

Getting us to a robust volume growth of 12% for the business, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine contribution.

The 12% volume growth is in spite of an approximately 2% negative impact to growth from Chantix recall and distribution pause.

 

This supports our projected revenue CAGR of at least 6% from 2020 through the end of 2025.

Of course, there will be some variability in quarterly growth rate to a variety of factors, but we continue to expect at least 6% CAGR through 2025.

 

There was no impact from the number of selling days in the quarter as compared to the year-ago period, like we saw on our First Quarter, where we had more selling days compared to the year-ago period.

I'd remind you that the offset to this imbalance will be seen in the Fourth Quarter results, where we will have fewer selling days as compared to the year-ago quarter.

 

For the full year, this results in essentially the same number of selling days in 21 as 2020.

I will come back to this in a little bit when I discuss the updated guidance.

 

The adjusted cost of sales increased shown here, reduced this quarter's gross margin by approximately 22% percentage points compared to the Third Quarter of 2020, which is almost entirely driven by the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Adjusted SI&A expenses increased primarily due to a level of promotional spend, sales force activity, or similar to pre-pandemic levels.

 

The increase in adjusted R&D expense this quarter, was primarily driven by increased investments in COVID-19 related programs, as well as other programs within our pipeline.

The growth rate for reported diluted EPS was 445%, while adjusted diluted EPS grew a 129% [Indiscernible].

 

Foreign exchange movements resulted in a 4% benefit to revenue, as well as a 4% benefit or $0.02 to adjusted diluted EPS.

Let's move to our revised 2021 guidance.

 

We have again provided total Company guidance which includes the business with the COVID-19 vaccine.

And then we provided some additional sub ledger details on our assumptions on the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution and the business without the COVID-19 vaccine.

 

Our revenue guidance has increased, and we now expect total Company revenue to be in a range of $81 to $82 billion, increasing by $2.5 billion at the midpoint.

With the COVID-19 vaccine revenue for the year now expected to be approximately $36 billion, an increase of approximately $2.5 billion compared to our prior guidance.

 

The projected COVID-19 vaccine revenue as a percentage of total Company revenue at the midpoint has increased to 44% as compared to 42% at our previous ' 21 guidance.

I'll come back to that in a minute.

 

We also adjusted our cost and expense guidance, mostly to reflect actual performance to date.

Let me give you some more detail here.

 

Adjusted cost of sales to range has decreased to between 39.1% to 39.6%.

On adjusted SI&A, we have tightened the range and now expect $11.6 to $12.1 billion a decrease for a $150 million at the midpoint.

 

In addition, we increased our adjusted R&D guidance range to $10.4 to $10.9 billion, an increase of $400 million at the endpoint to reflect anticipated incremental spending on COVID-19 and other mRNA -based projects.

We are keeping our assumption for the effective tax rate for the year flat compared to prior guidance at approximately 16%.

 

This yields an increased adjusted diluted EPS range of $4.13 to $4.18, or 84% growth at the midpoint compared to 2020, including an expected 4% benefit from foreign exchange.

Let me quickly remind you of some assumptions in context on the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution and our collaboration agreement.

 

As discussed earlier, the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine collaboration construct is a 50/50 gross profit split.

Pfizer books the vast majority of the global collaboration revenue, except for Germany and Turkey where we receive a profit share from BioNTech, and we do not participate in the China region.

 

We continue to expect that we can manufacture 3 billion doses in total by the end of 2021.

The $2.5 billion increase in expected COVID revenues to 36 billion primarily represents the impact of contracts signed since mid-July, which was the cut-off for our prior guidance.

 

This assumes deliveries of approximately 2.3 billion doses in fiscal year 2021 compared to prior guidance of deliveries of 2.1 billion doses and continues to assume that we will produce 3 billion doses during calendar year 2021.

This difference of 700 million doses represents doses which will be delivered in fiscal year 2022.

 

To refresh your memory, our cost of sales for the COVID-19 vaccine revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs, applicable royalty expenses, and a payment to BioNtech representing the 50% gross profit split.

We continue to expect that the adjusted income before tax margin for the COVID-19 vaccine contribution, to be in the high 20s as a percentage of revenue.

 

This margin level also includes the anticipated spending on additional mRNA programs and spending on the COVID-19 protease inhibitor antiviral programs.

If we remove the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution from both periods, you will see that we slightly decreased to 2021 revenue range to$ 45 to $46 billion.

 

So, representing approximately 6% operational revenue growth at the midpoint.

The decrease in guidance at the midpoint largely reflects the impact from the [Indiscernible] and pause in shipments.

 

Terms of adjusted diluted EPS without the contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, we have increased the range to be between 260 to 265 for the year which represents approximately 12% operational growth at the midpoint.

These growth rates are all consistent on how we've been publicly positioning the business post the Upjohn separation.

 

You may notice that the implied Q4 guidance suggests non-COVID-19 operational revenue to decline by 1%, especially as compared to the revenue growth that we've seen year-to-date of 8%.

Let me walk through the drivers of this.

 

The largest driver of the decline, is a difference in number of selling days, compared to the comparable quarter in 2020.

You will remember my discussion as extra selling days in Q1 when we had 3 more selling days in the U.S.

 

and 4 more selling days in the international markets.

And I talked then about how Q4 would largely offset that impact, leaving 2021 as a whole with approximately the same number of selling days, 2020.

 

In Q4, we will now have four fewer selling days each in domestic and international, eight less in total as compared to Q4, 2020.

This is expected to decrease sales by approximately $600 million, and have a negative impact of the growth rate of 6% for the Company, excluding COVID vaccine sales.

 

We expect the Chantix sales to be zero in Q4 due to recall and pause in shipments, representing another 2% headwind to growth.

And while it is not on normal practice to discuss 2022 outlook during the Q3 conference call, I wanted to make a brief comment related to potential Comirnaty sales next year, and we've noticed some estimates of those sales would be very high.

 

While we have the capacity to produce 4 billion doses in 2022 at this point, we expect to recognize revenues for 1.7 billion doses in 2022, representing COVID vaccine direct sales and Alliance revenues approximately $29 billion.

We continue to engage with governments regarding potential future orders for 2022 including doses for which certain governments have the option to order and take deliveries in 2022.

 

And going forward, we will continue to be prudent in our capital allocation activities with the opportunities for deployment shown here on this slide.

In summary, a strong quarter and first nine months of the year, based on continued strong performance for our growth drivers.

 

We have increased our revenue and EPS guidance for the remainder of the year, mainly driven by increased expectations for Comirnaty sales.

Our pipeline continues to advance and we have invested to support that advance.

 

We look forward to an expected closing of the Trillium acquisition as soon as this quarter or in the first half of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions.

With that, let me turn it over to Chris to start to start the Q&A session.

 



Chris Stevo

Thanks, Frank.

 

Sylvia, we're ready for our first question, please.
Operator

Your first question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore.

 



Umer Raffat

Hi, guys.

 

Thanks so much for taking my questions.

I have three today, if I may.

 

Perhaps first, Albert, do you expect vaccine efficacy on hospitalizations to fade overtime?

I know this has been a big point of discussion and has direct implications for the longer-term booster usage.

 

Do you expect the hospitalization efficacy to dip below, let’s say, an 80% number?

Number two, on the protease inhibitor, I was curious if you guys are expecting different activity in the high-risk versus a low-risk trial?

 

I acknowledge the endpoints are different, but is there any reason to expect viral load reduction to look different between the two?

And then finally, on the DMD gene therapy trial, I was curious if you have evaluated anti dystrophin antibodies, perhaps beyond the patients with exon 9-13 or 29, 30.

 

I am just trying to understand if there's a bit of an immune response against the dystrophin being made in other patients as well and whether that will be relevant for the primary endpoint or not.

Thank you so much.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you very much.

 

I think I will give all three questions to Mikael because they are clearly in his domain.

Mikael, what do you think about the vaccine efficacy, the protease activity and the DMD?

 



Mikael Dolsten

Thank you very much.

 

Our own studies, the real-world evidence is these coming from Israel all show that you do get waning over time, driven by the immune system, as expected, gradually reducing antibodies in the blood and activate the immune cells, as well as the appearance of more aggressive strain, in this case, the Delta strain.

We think that the data show that you first lose protection against symptomatic disease as you have noted in our trials.

 

And then you lose some protection, but more stage loss over severe disease and hospitalization.

We were really pleased to share with you today that when you look at the real-world evidence data, we're able, in a very meaningful and substantial way, improve with a third dose boost against all facets of disease, whether symptomatic, whether severe postpartum utilization, and even death.

 

So yes, there is just a shift in time, and that's why we already now are preparing for revaccination when the third boost immunity may start to fade possibly off the year, which we think would be the type of data to generate to support more of an annual vaccination similar as flu.

For the oral protease inhibitor, we think there is an opportunity with our approach where we are able to have high levels of the oral drug to get robust efficacy against high risk and low risk.

 

And that's obviously what we would like to see as the trial reads out and we have to wait for data.

I just wanted to emphasize that our standard risk group includes vaccinated breakthrough infection and non-vaccinated with their standard risk.

 

This is the only trial currently running to the best of my knowledge that contains a study population that are vaccinated and we'll get possibly breakthrough infection.

It's really unique indication, which is expected to have more and more prominence once the majority of people are vaccinated.

 

And finally, the household study - exposure study, in that one, we expect based on previous experiences from Tamiflu and other antiviral drug that you're likely to get a good probability for even higher, hopefully a very high, antiviral effect.

On DMD gene therapy, we're looking at ways to support this patient group that lack a part of the DMD protein, so they are not tolerant to their own protein and hence they generate an immune response to that part when they get the new gene.

 

I don't think that will happen in any individuals that are born with all components of the dystrophin, but maybe mutated to be not highly functional.

So, our focus right now is to executing the majority of patients 85% and then developing supportive protocols, which we think are very feasible also for those that have less tolerance and are more prone direct when they're given the full normal dystrophin transgene.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you very much, Mikael.

 

Let's go to the next question.
Operator

Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities.

 



Vamil Divan

Great.

 

Thank you so much for taking my questions.

So maybe just a couple like the one -- I appreciate, Frank, the comments you made around 2022 by in terms of the COVID vaccine sales.

 

Can you maybe just share updated thoughts on how you guys are seeing the revenue stream from these vaccines are playing out over time?

A lot of focus beyond ‘23, ‘24, ’25.

 

And so connected with that, or maybe a broader question about a year ago, you guys hosted that R&D Day and kind of went through the whole pipeline and talked about the $18 billion to $20 billion of revenue that you expect to lose because of that exploration starting in 2026.

At that point, you mentioned that the pipeline you felt with the least provision to replace that revenue stream?

 

I'm curious, given everything that’s happened in the past year, kind of what's your updated expectations on your ability to overcome those patent losses in the future?

Thank you.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you.

 

Frank, do you want to take out this?

And then also Angela, you can chime in on the revenue stream.

 



Frank D’amelio

Thanks, Albert.

 

Hi, Vamil.

So, Vamil, the way I would think about '22 is kind of a rhythm that's similar to '21.

 

And what I mean is, we'll continue to update the numbers for '22, based on the contracts that we've signed and then obviously the deliveries that will be shipped in '22 that go with those contracts.

So, think about this year, as we've updated our guidance each quarter, we've been able to increase our revenue guidance to the COVID vaccine because of incremental contracts signed from one quarter to the next.

 

We're using that same approach for 2022.

So right now, 1.7 billion, I call that kind of banked, if you will, in terms of the doses and the $29 million that goes with that.

 

Obviously, we've got to ship those doses, but we have contracts in hand that support the 1.7 billion doses and the $29 billion revenue.

So that'll be the rhythm of the numbers, the way to think about it going forward in '22.

 

Beyond '22, obviously, we're working our way through those numbers.

We continue to believe that the vaccine has durability and that there will continue to be significant revenues beyond '22, but in terms of specifics there, we're continuing to work on that.

 

Albert, I can turn that over to Angela if you'd like.



Albert Bourla

Yes please, Angela.

 



Angela Hwang

Sure.

 

Thank you.

And maybe just one more add to that, which is that, as you look into '22 and also the out-years, as Frank said, we will update you as the contracts get confirmed.

 

But many of our contracts already have been confirmed and those are multi-year contracts.

So, we already know that looking into '22 and the out years, that there are some that are going to continue to be government-driven.

 

And then maybe the one other thing that will change over the next in the foreseeable future, is just the development of a private market.

And most likely, we’ll see that developing in the U.S.

 

sooner than the others, because that's -- ex-U.S.

is where the multiyear contracts have already been secured.

 

But I think that that will be something -- a new dynamic that we are absolutely ready to manage.

And we're already transitioning our portfolio.

 

And if you look at the presentations of the vaccine that we have into smaller pack sizes, this instead of stability, different storage enhancements that we're making all with the view of preparing to transition into vaccinations in the community setting, and preparing for a durable business.

So, I would just add that to what Frank just mentioned.

 



Albert Bourla

Thanks Angela.

 

And what I will add in this question in addition to what Angela said, I will add that also commercial that's a position of strength for us.

I think moving into a private market that's where we know how to make a difference as well.

 

The other thing that I will say it is as you've noticed from the numbers, we are moving ahead to produce 4 billion doses.

And we have already secured the contracts for 1.7 billion doses.

 

And there are some more that we have secure in terms of options.

And clearly, we have a big number of countries that we're negotiating with us.

 

But again, I will raise my concern what I had raised in August of last year when most of the negotiation for doses in the next year are coming from high-income countries and some middle-income countries.

I think we are producing enough, but for the low- and middle-income countries who received non-for-profit at the lower income countries with very severely discounted price for the middle-income countries they need to place orders.

 

That's including COVAX and to WHO all of them.

So, the $4 billion doses that they're going to produce, they are still highly negotiated by the high-end upper middle-class countries and I don't want to reach that level, but again, the low-end middle-income counties would be behind in deliveries because they didn't place their orders amount, so that's one.

 

As regard the broader question of the 6%, I think nothing has changed, if anything, I think the probabilities are improving in terms of how our pipeline can cover the gap to make sure that we have a 6%.

So, when it comes to the 6% for all the years to after '25, we think we feel very, very confident that we will achieve it.

 

And then I remind everyone that this is excluding all this new mRNA that we're working, excluding COVID.

So, all of that is -- COVID vaccines -- all of that I think are in a very, very good state.

 

And we are very encouraged with the modern pipeline, the pipeline that comes to fill the gap between '25 and '30.

And this is also where we believe that right now, we can bring it significantly up.

 

What the street projects as a severe decline, I think already with our pipeline, our projections are saying that we will take it to slight growth -- flat to slight growth.

And we are very much looking forward to higher programs and we're looking forward to business development to -- because the goal is to sustain a 6% growth from the second part of [Indiscernible] as well, if possible.

 

Thank you.

Next question, please.

 
Operator

Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.

 



Tim Anderson

Thank you.

 

On the oral protease inhibitor, it's closely watched by investors now that Merck has positive results with Molnupiravir but it seems like in your prepared remarks, you spend more time talking about various [Indiscernible] programs in your pipeline versus this one where we'll have readouts sooner.

So, I'm wondering if this suggests a lower level of confidence by Pfizer in these upcoming readouts.

 

And then can you just talk about your views of Molnupiravir and also the recent data they released.

And also, how do you think drugs like this, whether it's your own PI or Molnupiravir will be used in a real-world setting?

 

Will it primarily be used in the studied populations which is really unvaccinated patients or will it be used more broadly?



Albert Bourla

Thank you very much.

 

We're very bullish on the oral inhibitor.

This is why, earlier this year during summer, I approved another billion-dollar investment at risk to start manufacturing [Indiscernible] and, of course, to start -- to run three studies in parallel; one for the high-risk population, one for the standard population and one for the household, or let's say context population.

 

We -- the studies are ongoing, so there is not much to say right now, other than we feel optimistic.

But we need to see the results of the studies and if possible, we'll be ready.

 

And we -- the way that those will be used, I think it is a -- there's significant part in the high-risk population, but because the cost of these medicines is way cheaper than the antibodies, I think the standard population also will have a significant uptake.

And of course, there is a high-volume opportunity in the contact population -- in household contact population, that could really change the paradigm.

 

There will be unvaccinated population but what unfortunately, will have them majority of the infections.

And I think these medicines will be predominantly coming to them, but there will be also breakthrough infections either with people of high risk or with other people.

 

But vaccinated people also will be in need of something like that.

Actually, Mikael made the comment about that when he spoke about the study that we're running for standard risk of population to our knowledge is the only one that it is around.

 

Just to make sure that there's no misunderstandings here, we are investing very heavily and recount we are cautiously optimistic that the studies will reveal the data, but we will speak when the data are here.

Now, as regards [Indiscernible], I will ask Mikael to make some points, but I would like to say that I don't think it is appropriate for us to comment on other oral inhibitor.

 

I think the fact that Merck's product announced the 50% efficacy.

I think that's great news for patients and a great news for the medical community.

 

But hopefully if the product is approved, they will have an option in their hand.

Mikael, do have anything to add to that without going to [Indiscernible] Merck's product that they should be the ones to speak about it.

 



Mikael Dolsten

Absolutely.

 

I think you outlined it very well.

We are optimistic, enthusiastic, but as always, we're waiting for the data that we hope to come before year-end for the high-risk.

 

The standard risk as you heard, we are only one running such a study for an oral drug.

It's really unique opportunity, and it will be a growing need for those that do not get repeat vaccinations.

 

And I think for the household study, a protease inhibitor, with its well-known safety is really intriguing.

As you know, protease inhibitor of this kind does not possess risk for the type of side effects [Indiscernible] that seen off sometimes with polymerase inhibitor and require longer follow-up before you know about the potential impact.

 

That's why we think the protease inhibitor is really perfect shift for the pandemic moving over gradually, hopefully to an endemic.

And we're just waiting eagerly to see it will help.

 

Thank you.



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Mikael.

 

Next question, please.
Operator

Your next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein.

 



Ronny Gal

Good morning, and thanks for taking my question.

 

I have three, if I may.

First, regarding your [Indiscernible] biosimilar, you kind of noticed the switch drive has been successful.

 

You've not comment specifically on filing for interchangeability.

Can you clarify that point?

 

Second, going across the wires are some comments from DC about negotiating drug prices for 30 drugs by 2028 as part of the negotiated agreement.

Is this something that drug industry can live with or not?

 

Is this something you're objecting to, or is this something that within a great bargain that will settle drug prices for the Drug Price legislation for the next 3 years, is this something the drug industry is comfortable with?

And last, regarding your oral GLP-1, [Indiscernible] are you expecting results in diabetes in the Fourth Quarter of this year?

 

Some of your peers suggested that the intraday variation in blood concentration of GLP-1 is bound to lead to higher side effect profile for the efficacy delivered.

Can you discuss what is your view here?

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you very much Ronny.

 

I will answer the drug price and Angela, I will pass you the biosimilar question and the rest of the oral GLP-1 to Mikael.

So let me start with negotiating the drug price.

 

First of all, I think that we have an issue, I said in multiple times with drug price.

But the issue is not the cost to the healthcare system.

 

[Indiscernible] the cost out-of-pocket for the patients for taking their medicines.

The cost of drug pricing to the overall healthcare system, it is 12%.

 

So, by definition, it cannot be the big problem.

And this cost is going down.

 

In the U.S.

in the First Quarter was minus 5, in the Second Quarter it was minus 5, in the Third Quarter is minus 5, in our audited numbers of Pfizer but the -- in fact -- of price.

 

Problem is that none of our patients that are taking our medicines are experienced minus 5 in what they pay.

Actually, they are experiencing increases.

 

And this is because there is a problem with insurance system that forces, tremendous out-of-pocket when it comes to medicines which is not the case when it comes to other, let's say, medical interventions, diagnostics, [Indiscernible] fees, hospitals you name it.

Now, what needs to be done is, to have a reform in a way that will affect out of pocket for the patients.

 

And I truly believe that there is a deal to be made right now in Washington.

I truly believe that.

 

And I think that the Congress should not miss the opportunity to find a deal right now that will reduce the out of pocket cost of patients which is the main, main issue right now.

When it comes to negotiating drug pricing, negotiation is good and are happening right now.

 

Medicare negotiates very effectively with us.

What people, some parts of the political spectrum, wants to see, is not negotiation, it is price fixing.

 

What they're suggesting is negotiation it is that we will be tell the price that if we disagree with this price, then they will tax us 90%, 95% on everything that we sell in the private market.

So, this is not negotiation, this is clearly a price fixing.

 

That I think we -- is going to be a very big mistake to see that happening [Indiscernible] we are objecting.

But what I want to emphasize here is not if we are disagreeing in negotiating with our pricing, I think it's a great opportunity to have a deal right now in the Congress and -- that will significantly reduce the out-of-pocket cost of the patients when they are taking their meds.

 

Now, with that I'm passing to Angela to speak about the [Indiscernible]



Angela Hwang

For the biosimilar for [Indiscernible], we will have interchangeability studies and we're finding that in December 2021.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Angela.

 



Angela Hwang

Mikael?

 



Mikael Dolsten

Yes.

 

The oral GLP-1, I think it's a class with a lot of promise.

I think [Indiscernible] is currently the most advanced true oral small molecule.

 

It has not at all the same type of full defects in direction as been seen with oral delivered peptide.

As you stated, we will have soon this year a readout with a slower titration for diabetes to optimize efficacy, convenience, and tolerability.

 

This is well known for all introduced GLP-1 peptides.

We'll later next year have an obesity readout and you noted [Indiscernible] an oral has an opportunity to be possibly the most powerful within the oral segment, and are much more convenient form for the injectable, particularly for the new emerging segments of obese patients that need metabolic control.

 

This is very attractive type of treatment to come.

And we look forward to generate more data and understand these types of new emerging through oral, how to optimally position it.

 

Thank you.



Albert Bourla

Thank you.

 

Next question, please.
Operator

Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.

 



Steve Scala

Thank you.

 

A couple of questions.

First on the oral COVID antiviral, the initial data seems to have been delayed from the Third Quarter or the Fourth Quarter of this year to the Fourth Quarter of this year and the First Quarter of next year.

 

So, what is the reason for the delay, for instance, are the events tracking below expectations?

And secondly, a follow-up on [Indiscernible].

 

So, the readout in obesity in the first half of next year is quite intriguing.

How quickly thereafter, assuming it's positive, could a Phase III study in obesity alone generate results?

 

Thank you.



Albert Bourla

Thank you, a very good question.

 

By the way, I don't think that we ever expected the oral in Q3.

I'm not sure if something like that was ever said.

 

I think we were always expecting it in the Q4 and still this is a very big chance that this would be the expectation.

We'll give a range of Q4 to Q1 of next year, but still this is the expectation that there's very highly chance that we'll have it by the end of the year.

 

But again, things are improving nicely in all three studies of the oral.

But sometimes you need to stop and wait for the data to speak for themselves.

 

So that's our attitudes we are preparing for it.

We are manufacturing and we will be ready if hopefully the data are positive.

 

And now about our obesity drug, Mikael, can you take this question?



Mikael Dolsten

Yes.

 

Just wanted to echo what you said, Albert, we have 305 enrolling well, across all the oral PI and we have used this target date for the quite loss periods.

So, we are on track.

 

And all looks well, we'll just wait for the readouts.

[Indiscernible] in obesity, we optimize obviously for the titration, as I discussed, because that's important in order to deliver this quite encouraging data that has recently been seen with GLP-1 class injectable.

 

Some reports have shown much above 10% body weight with metabolic gains.

So that's really the purpose to get the right titration, stage titration.

 

And this is a small molecule that we have developed manufacturing processes.

So, pending data and dialogues with regulators.

 

I think this is study that could progress quite fast to Phase III as the CMC is not complicated and the drug class is very well-known for regulators, just that this is an oral with an upside.



Albert Bourla

Thank you.

 

Next question, please?
Operator

Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor.

 



Louise Chen

Hi, thanks for taking my question.

 

My first question is on the oral antiviral for COVID.

Just curious how much you think you can manufacture -- how much you can manufacture, what do you think about the durability of these sales?

 

And then is there any first-mover advantage to getting on the market with this?

And then my second question is just on CD47, quite a few in development.

 

So how do you plan to differentiate your Trillium assets?

Thank you.

 



Albert Bourla

On the oral, as I said, we keep manufacturing and depends on how much -- we will have already product available this year.

 

And then of course, as we are moving into next year, our manufacturing capacity is ramping up.

The durability of this franchise, is more or less analog to the durability of the vaccines franchise, because as long as you had COVID around, you will have a need to vaccinate and protect and then you will have a need to treat and save lives.

 

And I think the durability I expect to be -- given that COVID has been really across the globe and in so many parts of the globe, and I think we're speaking about the years of durability.

But of course, that remains to be seen, that's only my assessment.

 

Mikael, can you speak about the CD47?



Mikael Dolsten

Yeah.

 

Now, that's a great question.

We think there are several aspects of unique differentiation and that's obviously why we were keen to work on the Trillium product.

 

Number 1.

This is ligand trap with an effusion to provide longer half-life.

 

So, it has a lower binding to CD47 than a typical antibody.

And it has shown both the in pre-clinical studies and now in clinical studies that you do not get the problematic on target anemia that you see with antibodies.

 

So that's an important unique thing, it matters a lot, particularly for blood cancer patients which already have a fragile bone marrow function, but also for potential solid cancers that are treated with various chemotherapy backbone.

Number 2 is this product is to the best of my knowledge the only one that have showed single agent activity in blood cancers and we have the most advanced dataset coming out in lymphoid malignancies, both related to B-cell malignancies, lymphomas and myelomas.

 

And we see opportunities to combine it with several existing Pfizer assets to give us unique life cycle management.

So, several unique aspects, we look forward to posts -- to see potential deal closure, and to work with the staff in Trillium to accelerate these exciting assets.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Mikael.

 

And Angela, I didn't ask if you have to add anything on the oral in terms of the durability of the revenues other than what I said?



Angela Hwang

Well, the market that we're looking at, we estimate to be about 150 -- up to 150 million people.

 

When we look at the -- just vaccination rate, infection rates, and then the various risk groups that we talked about today; the high risk, the low risk, as well as those who just maybe in contact with those that are infected, this is the size of population that we're looking at.

I think that this opportunity will allow -- is a very attractive one.

 

And I think that, again, the disease patterns will determine where we go with this, but certainly, it looks to be a durable opportunity as well.

And also, not to forget that this is probably something that governments would likely -- would be interested in stockpiling, like the way -- like we saw in the flu.

 

I think that that's an additional commercial opportunity to consider here.



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Angela.

 

Next question, please.
Operator

Your next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.

 



Matthew Harrison

Great.

 

Good morning.

Thanks for taking my questions.

 

I have three, if you don't mind.

So first one is, can you talk about the 2022 revenue for the for the COVID vaccine and just give us some sense of what is -- what of that is primary series and what of that is boosters and just how you think about that developing over time?

 

Then second on your flu data for your mRNA vaccine.

Can you, I guess comment one, on if you've had any regulatory discussions and if you think you could get approved for just tighter data alone, or you need to run an actual efficacy study, and then secondly, what should we expect to see with that initial readout?

 

And then third, can you just detail what the protocol changes for Hem A and what you think the underlying factors are that are driving those high levels of factor?

Thank you.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you.

 

The 2022 revenues are mostly from the countries in --for COVID that Frank spoke.

This $29 billion that we have already signed committed contracts of 1.7 billion doses.

 

Those doses, when it comes to high income countries, they are mainly boosters.

When it comes to middle income countries and to low-income countries, there is a mix of second doses -- of primary doses, particularly second because you will be given a lot this year [Indiscernible], and also some of them are boosters.

 

And this is why I said that the low and middle-income countries or even the low-income countries where we do not -- we give it at cost.

They need to place orders so that they can secure allocations of our quantities for their boosters.

 

They need to think.

Now, I will ask Mikael to speak a little bit about our regulatory discussions on the efficacy, or not, for flu, and then why we're doing the protocol changes.

 

Sorry.



Mikael Dolsten

We're very intrigued by the use of mRNA for flu as it can generate both an antibody response against hemagglutinin and a T-cell response that can be protective, particularly for more severe flu cases.

 

The current flu vaccine, the protein-based are not very potent on T-cell responses, and generate more intermediate level of antibodies.

Whether you can register products on those type of immune parameters is something we are, of course, considering and as we generate data, we'll have dialogues with regulators.

 

But, of course, advantageous not just to get the approvals but to have a strong data set on an outcome such as vaccine efficacy.

The program will include both outcomes.

 

As always, you do not need inferiority of antibodies and you may have additional immune parameters that do not exist very much with the traditional flu, but the entire program will, of course, look at vaccine efficacy to also take into account, is broader immune response.

But we'll obviously always keep our regulatory dialogues open for opportunities to serve patients as quick as possible.

 

On the protocol change to Hem A we saw that we had some patients that got very high levels of Hem A gene therapy, 150%.

We didn't see actual -- we have not recorded any issues in the haemophilia patients with this.

 

We want to just have an abundance of caution, to have a protocol that would allow active management.

And of course, if there are any patient with some risk’s factors, they could easily use oral anti-coagulants, such as Eliquis.

 

I want to just put this into context as we finalize the regulatory submission on this protocol update, that having high Factor VIII level has also some potential longer-term advantage on sustainability of gene therapy.

The Factor VIII data that you've seen also from others in the field have shown some more attenuation over time for the Factor VIII molecules.

 

We have reported so far very good efficacy with no need for transfusion and no bleeding.

But to be in the upper range, where we are, on average 60% to 70%, maybe something that allow much longer gene therapy benefit than if you were on the lower end of the spectrum, particularly for Factor VIII patients.

 

Thank you.



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Mikael.

 

And also, let me add in my previous answer when I said that for the high-income countries is predominantly boosters, of course, there are also, as vaccine rates are getting higher there are primary doses.

But also, I forgot to mention the pediatric.

 

And the pediatric, they will be predominantly in next year's revenues.

Keep in mind that in Europe, Japan, all the international markets all revenues of COVID that will be realized next month are going to the next financial year and over there will be a lot of pediatrics.

 

Of course, in the U.S.

we'll have also some pediatric booked this year.

 

So, with that, the next question, please.
Operator

Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.

 



Chris Schott

Great.

 

Thanks so much.

Just two for me.

 

First coming back to the vaccine targets for '22.

As we think about the doses beyond the 1.7 billion that you've now contracted for.

 

Is there still sale -- incremental sales opportunity in developed markets for next year or most governments contracted already?

I'm just trying to get a sense if we should be thinking about most of those doses, I guess you mentioned in the call a few times, going to emerging markets and low-priced geographies where the vaccines sold closer to cost, or could there actually be some still higher price per dose business to be had?

 

My second question on the vaccine is also just on the margin.

Is that high 20% margin that we saw this year a reasonable assumption for next year given the R&D work going on, etc.?

 

And then just a final question was on the COVID PI just talk about that standard risk trial when you're looking at both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.

Is that study powered to look at those populations separately, if we were to see different outcomes in that readout as we think about later this year or next year?

 

Thanks so much.



Albert Bourla

Thank you.

 

I'll start with Angela to answer about the COVID vaccines remain doses next year.

Frank, if you can give an answer on the margin, and then Mikael, understands our risk study.

 

Angela.



Angela Hwang

Thanks for the question Chris.

 

No, we are not all done with the developed markets.

Certainly, the contracts are in place and many of them are in place.

 

But also, don't forget that many of these contracts have options attached to them, and those have not been realized.

So, I think that there is still opportunity in 2022 for the developed world to acquire additional doses.

 



Albert Bourla

Frank?

 



Frank D’amelio

And the increase on the IBT is a percentage of revenue for the COVID vaccines.

 

Remember that IBT as a percentage of revenue includes; manufacturing and distribution, applicable royalty expense, and then the gross profit split with BNT so that gets you to I'll call it gross margin.

And then we also include in that IBT percentage all of the R&D associated with COVID-related programs for both prevention and treatment and other mRNA-related programs.

 

When you put all of that together, we've guided this year to IBT as percentage of revenues in the high 20s.

For next year, you should assume the same thing and then obviously we'll provide updated guidance on all of the P&L line items on our next earnings call when we close out Q4, provide guidance for 2022.

 



Albert Bourla

Mikael?

 



Mikael Dolsten

Yeah.

 

Thank you for your interest in the standard risk oral PI trials.

As I said, no other oral drug, actually the monoclonal antibodies were not used either.

 

So, it's really unique population, which we also recognized as we enrolled the trial, it's enrolling now very well in the trial.

And yes, we have secondary endpoints that we'll look at the 2 different groups.

 

And I do think if the vaccine efficacy is what we hope, [Indiscernible] treatment efficacies, what we hope, that should be within our reach to get the claims on both vaccinated breakthrough and all commerce that includes unvaccinated.

And as I said, it will be to the best of my knowledge, the only trial on standard risk debt are not vaccinated, but it has this unique opportunity where antibodies are difficult to use in vaccinated, and there is no other way of running it.

 

This is a growing population and in countries that may be late with revaccinations, of course, this is a really interesting drug profile.

Also, for new variant, please remember, I didn't emphasize it that much, our oral PI, to date has shown robust activity against all variants of -- from Delta to Alpha variants, all variants we have tested, we believe it's going to be active against many different coronaviruses.

 

So, Angela spoke about stockpiling.

It also has a stockpiling opportunity for new things coming up in the Corona family, even if they're quite remote from SARS-Cov-2.

 

So, it's a real important drug before the world and fingers crossed as we look forward to readout.



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Mikael.

 

Next question, please.
Operator

Your next question comes from Geoffrey Porges, from FVB, Leerink.

 



Geoffrey Porges

Thank you very much.

 

A few quick questions.

First, on Prevnar, could you give us a sense of whether you believe Prevnar will return to growth next year and have -- what is the supply that you expect to have in terms of number of doses for next year?

 

Secondly, on the question of overall guidance, it seems to me that next year should be another growth year for Pfizer given what you're saying about the many opportunities for both the COVID vaccine and the antiviral.

I know you haven't given guidance, but can you give us a sense of whether that's your expectation as well?

 

And then lastly on capital, it seems pretty clear that you'll almost be in a net positive cash position by the end of this year given the cash that's coming in for the COVID vaccine, there have been some suggestions that you might redeploy that capital into returning to the consumer business.

Is that of any interest or you got to maintain the focus on strictly innovative biopharma?

 

Thanks.



Albert Bourla

Angela, on Prevnar?

 



Angela Hwang

Sure.

 

As we think about the Prevnar adult revenues, I think we have to look at it at the different age ranges.

For the 65 plus, the opportunity will be obviously those who are aging in the nearly 65 that are becoming every year, as well as the opportunity and we're actually waiting for the CDC and MMWR to give us guidance as to whether those who have been previously vaccinated with PCV 13 will be candidates for re-vaccination.

 

That's how I think about revenue on the 65 plus.

And then in addition to that one, what is completely new is the 18 to 64 efforts.

 

This is a whole new population.

It is a large population.

 

And this will be the other opportunity that we'll be looking to for PCV 20 in '22 and beyond.



Albert Bourla

Geoff, look on the guidance.

 

First of all, this year we have record -- recorded record sales and I'm very happy that you're predicting that like last year we may grow.

We will provide guidance as always in the first month of the year in our fourth call earnings, which I think is late January.

 

As regards the capital allocation, Frank has spoken multiple times about lot of priorities and capital allocation.

We are maintaining a growing dividend, that's very clear, and then our second priority is clearly to invest in the business, to invest in developing the business, and actually I will turn to Aamir Malik, which is his first call here to speak a little bit about opportunities in business development and how he sees them.

 



Aamir Malik

Thanks, Albert.

 

Thanks, Geoffrey.

We see business development frankly as a very important part of our strategy and we plan to be very active in deal-making.

 

Specifically, we're going to be interested in compelling later-stage assets that can contribute positively to the top-line growth in the back half of the decade, and we're also going to be interested in accessing medical breakthroughs that are in earlier stages of development.

And we frankly see, focusing in these areas as being much more value-creating than synergy-driven deals that require lots of resource-intensive integrations that can take a long time to complete.

 

Obviously, we don't speak in absolutes and we never say never, but right now our focus will be as I described.

On compelling later-stage assets and earlier-stage medical breakthroughs in biopharma.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Aamir and we rightly, as you can understand, we are very active as we speak in a lot of these discussions.

 

So next question, please.
Operator

Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.

 



Andrew Baum

Thank you.

 

A couple of questions.

As you look at the competitive environment for oral antivirals for COVID, could you talk how you're thinking about the probability of either your compound or the competitor having a REMS program.

 

I know that [Indiscernible] did at one point, but I think it has REMS now and your protease, shouldn't [Indiscernible] one from a [Indiscernible] point of view.

If you care to comment on the competitive outlook for those two drugs from a regulatory side that would be interesting.

 

And then second, you've spoken previously, Angela, about the Xeljanz rebate providing sufficient ammunition against AbbVie to ensure that Abrocitinib is not disadvantaged when you launch in securing positions on [Indiscernible].

When I look at the totality of the rebate that AbbVie's products generate, it would seem to be a multiple of what Xeljanz does.

 

Doesn't that still mean that you're potentially going to be disadvantaged as you seek to win share in the atopic dermatitis indication?

Many thanks.

 



Albert Bourla

Andrew, thank you for all.

 

As always, very good questions.

Angela I will give both of them to you.

 



Angela Hwang

Andrew, I think on the Abro one as we have learned and we've talked about this in the past as well, we're just in a really different place now.

 

We have a tremendous number of contracts that we have in place, you see that in the gross-to-net when you look at Xeljanz and work with these -- with the various payers.

And it's continuing as -- with all new products when you launch, access and getting access is always a critical issue.

 

And so, we'll continue to do that as we have with all of our products for Abro, not to forget that obviously the profile that we have, the value that we can bring to patients as well as organizations is a big part of what's going to help us to be able to get that access.

So, I think that we'll do what we've always done, and that access will build through time.

 

And we believe that we do have a competitive profile that will allow us to play a role in this very, very big market.

On your other question, which was related to the protease inhibitor, Andrew would you mind just repeating that again?

 



Albert Bourla

[Indiscernible]

 



Mikael Dolsten

I'm happy to say a few words.

 

So, you were all --



Albert Bourla

Yes, okay.

 

Mikael please.



Mikael Dolsten

-- The different profiles of protease inhibitor and polymerase and how that could play out and the need for REMS.

 

Well, as always, we -- pending positive data, we are extremely experienced in pharmacovigilance programs, and we'll discuss with regulators what they see as the appropriate.

For the high-risk group we'll have a five-day study and there could be then options for a polymerase or a protease inhibitor.

 

And it could be an upside to even look at combination between those in the future.

For the standard risk, to the best of my knowledge, we are the only one that will be completing that study in a relative near-term, and actually the only one running it.

 

And for the household exposure study, there you are treating potentially healthy uninfected individuals, and as a physician, I would just say that the protease inhibitor class has been and is known to be addressing unique viral product and not really affecting the human cells.

So, I would think it would be a very much preferred [Indiscernible] class if the profile comes out as we hope, polymerase inhibitor, nucleoside base, you're always concerned in healthy individuals whether they could incorporate into the genome.

 

Whether the germ line or the mitochondrial genome, so I would think that's something you need to keep in consideration.

But that's why we were keen to be working on an oral PI because it is broad utility [Indiscernible] to future variants and future coronaviruses.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Mikael.

 

And now the last question, please?
Operator

Your final question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays.

 



Carter Gould

Great.

 

Good morning.

Thanks for squeezing us in.

 

I guess to start, I just wanted to come back to the 2022 guide.

Can you first clarify that that 1.7 billion doses are inclusive of the 700 million that was left over from 2021?

 

And I guess regardless your 4 billion capacity far exceeds the doses you expect to deliver.

I appreciate Frank's comment to the projected doses to be distributed will likely -- may and likely will evolve.

 

But is it safe to assume you're done increasing capacity and/or ' 22 could be a peak on capacity?

And then on the TL1A inhibitor, this is the first time I think we're hearing you guys talk about this publicly, presumably which we believe you have a better understanding of what drove the immunogenicity in [Indiscernible] here that you don't view the rate of [Indiscernible] as a problem or that you have confidence it will decrease with the subq formulation.

 

Any insight on this front?

And then finally, still plan to hold that Analyst Day this year or has the thinking changed on that front?

 

Thank you.



Albert Bourla

Many questions.

 

Angela, explain a little bit the 1.7.



Angela Hwang

Sure.

 

I think the way to think about it is that the 1.7 billion doses that we talked about for '22, are those that we have line of cycle contracts for.

And as Frank said, as contracts continue to be confirmed and finalized, will add to that.

 

The spillover that you mentioned, which is the end of fiscal year but really not the end of calendar year, and so there is some -- there were some doses that were contracted for in 2021, but the revenue will be collected in 2022, so somewhere between December and January.

I think the way to think about it is just that we have to look at contracts as well as revenue recognition and those are two -- they're two slightly different things.

 



Albert Bourla

Frank, capacity?

 



Frank D’amelio

So, Carter, 3 billion doses this year, 4 billion doses next year.

 

Quite frankly, I think as demand requires, we can continue to expand on our capacity.

Just as an example, give you some of the improvements we've made.

 

When we first thought of making the other vaccine, it took us 110 days from [Indiscernible].

We've taken 110 days down to 31 days, so over 70% improvement in terms of the process.

 

And quite frankly, I think we continue to make more improvement, so I don't think capacity is going to be a challenge for us.

I think just the matter of our making sure we're meeting the demand that's being generated by patients.

 

And obviously by the contracts we generate and the like.

But I don't see capacity as some constraining factor for us.

 



Albert Bourla

Well said Mikael -- Frank.

 

Mikael TL1A?



Mikael Dolsten

Yes.

 

Thank you for -- Carter -- for asking about TL1A, it's a noble member of the TNFs super family.

It's actually had some genetic association with IBD Crohn's disease a more severe Crohn's disease.

 

We're by far the most advanced with our biological.

And so far, we have not seen any meaningful impact of [Indiscernible] on activity of the drug in patients.

 

So, we think we will be able to manage that.

Of course, we are waiting for the final readout of the study.

 

We think it could be a drug given conveniently subcutaneously.

We are reporting based on a biomarker, first to my knowledge, to have a biomarker for selecting of high responders that captured still broader patient group.

 

And if you look at the efficacy in the biomark group, it's really above where any other agents have reported so far.

And that's what we want to report and reproduced in the extended study.

 

And this Tl1A is highly applicable not only to issue colitis, but also to Crohn's, so that's another indication where we will aim to go, which is supported also by genetic study.

So, thank you very much for your interest in it and look forward to keep you updated as we generate more data and move on with this exciting program.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Mikael.

 

And Chris, maybe you answer the question about the analyst I think there was an R&D Day I think in the question, right?



Mikael Dolsten

Sorry about the -- yes.

 



Chris Stevo

Yes.

 

Sorry.

That is our plan, correct.

 



Albert Bourla

All right, so you've heard of that.

 

I think, Chris, that's the end of our call, right?



Chris Stevo

It is.

 



Albert Bourla

Maybe I will make, perhaps, one closing comment.

 

Clearly, we're very happy and very excited for, first of all -- and proud for the impact that we have on global health and public health across the world with 150 countries receiving our vaccines.

More than a billion people, we have touched their lives with our medicines and products.

 

I think that's a record not only for us, but for any pharmaceutical Company so far.

Also, that came with very strong financial rewards also.

 

Our $80 plus billion of revenues that we will record this year likely sets a new record from the sales so far of any pharma clearly for Pfizer.

We are looking with a lot of optimism in the future because our pipeline is having very exciting projects that are moving very nicely into our utilizing our learning, and our development from COVID-19, so that we can accelerate even further and create new standards not only for us, but for the industry.

 

Thank you very much for your support.

And I wish you a nice day.

 
Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes Pfizer's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.

 

You may now disconnect.","Operator

Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to the analyst call on the GSK's Third Quarter 2021 Results.

 

I will now hand you over to Nick Stone, Head of Investor Relations, who will introduce today's session.



Nick Stone

Thank you, Operator.

 

And good morning and good afternoon.

As you've just said, I am Nick Stone, Head of Investor Relations at GSK.

 

It's my pleasure to welcome you to our third quarter 2020 conference call and webcast for investors.

The presentation was posted to GSK.com and was also sent to our distribution list a little bit earlier today.

 

Please turn to slide 2.

This is usual safe harbor statements and will be making comments from performance using constant exchange rate or CR.

 

Please turn to slide 3.

This is today's agenda where we'll try to cover all aspects of our results.

 

The presentation will last approximately 25 minutes in order to maximize the opportunity to questions.

For those on the phone, please join the queue by pressing star 1 and we request that you ask a maximum 2 questions so that everyone has a chance to participate.

 

Our speakers today are Emma Walmsley, Deborah Waterhouse, Brian McNamara, and Iain Mackay.

The Q&A portion of the call, we will be joined by Dr.

 

Hal Barron, Roger Connor, and David Redfern.

And with that, I will now hand the call over to [Indiscernible].

 



Deborah Waterhouse

Fine, Nick, and a warm welcome to everyone.

 

On to slide 5.

I am delighted to announce another quarter of strong financial performance and continued progress against our strategic priorities.

 

Third quarter sales and adjusted EPS were both up 10% of CEO.

These excellent results were driven by strong commercial execution, and underlying demand, with double-digit growth in pharma and vaccines, 24% growth in new and [Indiscernible] proof that our pipeline is bearing fruit, and an acceleration in Consumer Healthcare growth.

 

Continued cost discipline supported this performance.

Today's results demonstrate the building momentum in the business, which has enabled us to improve our full-year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance and narrowed the range to between minus 2% and minus 4% CER.

 

The guidance excludes any contribution from COVID-19 solutions, which we now expect to contribute an additional 7% to 9% to this adjusted EPS for the year, a very positive result.

Alongside our strong financial performance, we continue to make excellent progress in R&D.

 

Additional indications have been approved for Nucala in respiratory, and Jemperli in cancer.

We also received U.S.

 

FDA priority review of Cabotegravir for the prevention of HIV.

Following the positive headline results announced in July for [Indiscernible] another potential best-in-class new medicine for treating chronic kidney disease.

 

We will present key data in a late breaking session at ASN Kidney weight.

The B merger and creation of a world leader and consumer healthcare continues to be fully on track.

 

And we were delighted to unveil exciting plans for a new global campus and innovation center here in the UK.

And lastly, as we look ahead together, we are all strongly committed to delivering health impact at scale and maximizing value for shareholders.

 

Our resolute focus remains on world-class execution and successful delivery of our stated key strategic objectives, beginning, with a step changing in growth in 2022, an exciting and important year for our Company.

Turn slide 6.

 

progress in the third quarter was reflected across all 3 of our strategic priorities.

In innovation, we continue to build a high-value pipeline across prevention and treatment of disease through organic and inorganic delivery.

 

I just mentioned some of the highlights and several more listed on the slide.

Among them, I'm also delighted we're now playing a meaningful role in the COVID-19 response through our antibody treatment, Xevudy, with several COVID-19 vaccine programs seem to readout, and we remain agile as the environment continues to evolve.

 

And performance continuously improving.

Commercial execution is driving robust growth, and strong share performances in new and specialty products.

 

For Shingrix specifically, we have seen an impact as a result of the surge in the Delta variant, but we are increasingly confident we're on the recovery track.

The initiatives we've put in place and the underlying demand will drive strong growth in 2022 with the potential to deliver record annual sales.

 

Luke is going to take you through the details of this in a minute as well as our confidence in the medium-term opportunity for Shingrix.

And then consumer strong brand performance also drive a significant acceleration in growth in the quarter as [Indiscernible].

 

Lastly, on trust, we continue to maintain leadership in ESG with the recent announcement of significant renewable energy investments in carbon reduction initiatives at our manufacturing sites in the UK and U.S.

We also announced the new R&D program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from metered dose inhalers which are responsible for 45% of the Company's carbon emissions.

 

And these new initiatives support the continued progress on our environmental commitments to be net 0 and nature positive by 2030, which we'll share more on COP26.

I also, of course, welcome the recent WHO recommendation for a broader deployment of our malaria vaccine.

 

Malaria kills more than 250,000 children a year in Sub-Saharan Africa.

And this is the first and only vaccine shown in pivotal long-term clinical trials to significantly reduce childhood illness and death from malaria.

 



Emma Walmsley

Please turn to slide 7.

 

I'll take a moment to expand on my comments on innovation.

On our investor update in June, we shared how we did significantly improved R&D productivity since 2017.

 

For the top quartile performance versus our peers for the number of launches with the approval of 11 major [Indiscernible].

We've more than doubled the number of assets in Phase 3 of pivotal studies from 11 to 23.

 

And created a pipeline of over 60 medicines and vaccines, many with first-in-class or best-in-class potential.

The result of all of this work and targeted investment in an increasingly valuable pipeline with real momentum.

 

It is worth restating that major pipeline approvals delivered from 2017 to 2021, plus anticipated pipeline approvals will drive more than 100% of our forecasted sales growth from 2021 to 2026.

Over the next 12 months, eventually a number of readouts and regulatory [Indiscernible] support the confidence we have in the outlooks we provided for GSK in June.

 

Specifically, we expect to report key readouts on up to 7 of the 11 assets we highlighted, including our older adults are as feedback seen in the first half of 2022, as well as proof-of-concept data on our potential HP therapeutic.

And we're planning a regulatory submission for blend and third line multiple myeloma, and as I mentioned previously, you're going to hear a lot more on DAP produce at ASN Kidney Week and our investor science event, which is also scheduled for early November.

 

Please, on slide 8.

Lastly, I want to take I've been on the timelines, the demerger of our world-leading Consumer Healthcare business.

 

We are in countdown mode and moving at pace with our plans to unlock the potential of both GSK and Consumer Health, strengthened GSK balance sheet, and maximize value for all our shareholders.

We're committed to the demerger of at least 80% of GSK's holding, and for the remaining 20% to be monetized in a timely and pragmatic manner.

 

As momentum builds towards this important event, you want to see several important steps in the process.

Most visible will be the announcement of a chair designate, and subsequently an appropriately skilled board for Consumer Health.

 

In the first quarter of 2022, we plan to hold a Capital Markets Day, which will set out in detail the performance and compelling prospects for Consumer Health as a new and independent Company.

We will then proceed with a premium listing of the new Consumer business on the London Stock Exchange, creating 2 companies, set-up for independent delivery of competitive growth, shareholder value, and scale impact from human health.

 

Now, let me hand over to the team to take you through the growth drivers in detail.

So Luke, first over to you.

 



Luke Miels

Thanks, Emma.

 

So we made strong progress in the quarter on commercial execution and competitiveness, which you've seen come through in the revenue and market share numbers.

For today, I want to focus my remarks on our strong performance in new and specialty and our confidence in the growth prospects for Shingrix.

 

Please turn to slide 10.

Growth in our new and specialty pharma medicine accelerated to 24% in the third quarter, taking us to 18% growth year-to-date.

 

These figures include HIV, which Deborah will cover in a few minutes.

As we've seen throughout 2021, Trelegy continues to deliver with 77% growth in Q3.

 

The asthma indication is proving to be a unique differentiator.

And our leading position in this space remains unchanged, with Trelegy holding 90% of the single inhaler triple therapy market in the U.S.

 

Our market-leading IL-5 Nucala also contributed double-digit growth up 20% in the quarter.

We continue to hear from physicians that a clear and targeted approach to eos -driven disease is preferred, and we remain confident in Nucala 's market opportunity as we launch nasal polyps in the U.S.

 

in July and received positive CHMP opinion for EGPA, HES, and nasal polyps in Europe.

Additionally, Benlysta has its 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth up 35% in Q3.

 

Convenient subset formulation and lupus nephritis indication in the U.S.

build on the established leadership we have in Italy, while we continue to build the market in other parts of the world like China.

 

And finally, our Oncology portfolio continues to grow.

We received an additional approval for Jemperli in August, and in Q3 grew Zejula sales by 14%.

 

We continue to see 1 and 2 new POP patients receiving Zejula despite a tough external environment where unfortunately, diagnosis remain about 16% below pre - Covid levels.

Encouragingly, and based on new patient stock data, we're also seeing [Indiscernible] as the preferred choice to new patients across 3 lines with European.

 

But Blenrep, we now have more than 4,000 patients treated globally.

And we're expanding use in the community where the majority of multiple myeloma patients are.

 

We look forward to the opportunity of more patients benefiting from Blenrep as two pivotal studies, drain 3 and drain?

readout.

 

Please turn to slide 11.

In vaccines, we delivered a strong quarter of growth with Shingrix on the recovery track following pandemic related disruptions that impacted performance earlier this year.

 

The performance of Shingrix in the quarter primarily reflected a favorable impact from inventory movements and also a larger proportion of Shingrix being administered in HCP offices.

A trend we've been tracking through the course of the pandemic as retailers prioritize vaccinations for COVID-19.

 

Performance outside the U.S.

was also encouraging with a recovery underway in Germany and several successful launches in new markets.

 

As you can see on this slide, Shingrix TRx volumes are improving as we move through the year despite disruption from the Delta variant slowing the pace of the recovery.

With a challenging comparative in Q4 hit and prioritization of COVID-19 booster vaccinations in the near-term, we now expect the year-to-date performance, which is modest 11 CER, to be a good indication for the direction of travel for Shingrix for the full year.

 

While this is below our previous sales expectation, we consider these as deferred, not lost sales.

Our confidence in this transformational vaccine remains unchanged, and the underlying demand remains strong.

 

A market research confirms that patients that have been fully vaccinated for COVID ranked their interest in getting a shingles vaccine higher than any other adult vaccine, except flu.

And we're implementing activities to drive recovery with multi-channel direct-to-consumer campaigns, engaging healthcare providers, and further strengthening our relationships with U.S.

 

retailers.

Looking ahead, we continue to launch a new markets with our unconstrained supply position, and we expect continued U.S.

 

recovery as we work through COVID boosters in the near-term.

Taken together, we anticipate Shingrix to deliver strong double-digit growth in 2022.

 

And assuming an improved operating environment, we expect next year to be a record year for Shingrix turnover.

Further, we remain confident in our ambition to double revenues in the next 5 years, predicting more than 100 million adults along the way.

 

Now, let me hand over to Deborah.

Please turn to slide 12.

 



Deborah Waterhouse

Thanks, Luke.

 

Third quarter HIV sales grew by 8%, driven by the growth in the innovation portfolio and taking year-to-date growth to 4%.

In Q3, around 2% of the growth was driven by favorable wholesale purchasing patterns in the U.S.

 

and 2% by the growth dependent in the international region.

Strong commercial execution is driving performance at the innovation products which now represent 29% of total portfolio delivering almost PS1 billion of sales year-to-date.

 

Dovato, in particular, continue to grow strongly, building on the positive momentum that we saw in Q2.

In the U.S.

 

and Europe, despite the suppressed switch market, Dovato has gained further share with 15.3% and 27.8% of the switch market respectively.

Turning to Cabotegravir, the world's long acting injectable treatment for HIV.

 

As of any new type of medicine, Cabotegravir will take time to build and the COVID environment continues to constrain which activity, particularly where a patient needs to visit a physician's office.

We have robust lead indicators with about 80% market access, and strong brand recognition.

 

More than 2,000 people living with HIV are now taking Cabotegravir and intend to prescribe levels are high.

We are very excited about the potential approval launch of 2 monthly dosing in the U.S.

 

in early 2022.

This quarter, we also made significant progress with Cabotegravir long acting for prevention.

 

Last month, the FDA confirmed [Indiscernible] granting Priority Review status, which builds upon its priorities application, a break-through therapy.

We believe this underscores the importance of this medicine, supported by the results of the HPTN studies, which demonstrates the Cabotegravir's superior efficacy over daily oral STC, TDS tablet -- TDS tablets.

 

In the United States, fewer than 25% of those who could benefit from PEP-PrEP are currently taking it, which points to the need for additional HIV prevention options.

A final FDA regulatory decision is anticipated in January 2022.

 

As we said at the investor updates in June, we expect our non-GAAP and portfolio of Cabotegravir long acting for prevention to generate sales of around a million pounds by 2026.

We will take particularly proud to announce the new collaborations with our longstanding partner, Shinogi, on a third-generation HIV integrase inhibitor with potential for ultra-long acting dosing intervals.

 

This agreement aims to build on the success of dolutegravir and Cabotegravir, with the potential to anchor the next-generation of innovative long acting therapies beyond 2030.

I conclude by inviting all of you to attend an HIV investor event on the 29th of November in which we will share further details about the growth outlook and early stage pipeline.

 

There will, of course, be plenty of time for you to ask questions.

With that, I will hand over to Brian.

 

Please turn to play -- to slide 13.



Brian McNamara

Thanks, Deborah.

 

Now turning to Consumer Healthcare in Q3.

We saw strong growth with sales excluding brands divested and under review up 10% at constant exchange rate reflecting good momentum and execution across the business.

 

Importantly, performance improved across all categories and regions helped by strong investment in the business.

Emerging markets performed well with continuing business of double-digit and with China and Middle East and Africa standout performers.

 

Let me provide some color on our category performance.

All our health sales increased 5% reflecting continued good execution and successful innovation.

 

Pain relief was up double-digit helped by easy competitors last year, and strong double-digit growth in brands including Advil and Panadol more than offsetting a low single-digit decline in Volterra.

The Volterra decline was expected given the entry of private label into the category following the successful U.S.

 

RXOTC switch last year.

Vitamins, minerals, and subsequent growth was up 19% driven by strong growth in emergency and good Centrum results, helped by increased capacity enabling a return to more normal retail stock levels.

 

Respiratory benefited from good growth in allergy and in cold and flu, as well as some help from favorable competitors in the prior year, resulting in sales up 16%.

Digestive health and other sales were up 3% in the quarter.

 

Similar to consumer peers, we saw further pressure from cost inflation in the period.

However, our cost structure, combined with a continued focus on productivity, along with pricing across our categories and regions, enabled us to increase both gross margin and operating margin.

 

Innovation continued to be an important growth driver, and we had 6 first market launches in the quarter, taking this number up to 25 year-to-date, and 281 launches including market roll-outs.

In e-commerce year-to-date, we grew in the mid 20% range and is now 7% of sales.

 

Our ongoing investment in digital capabilities continues to position us well for growth in this key channel.

Year-to-date, 7 of our 9 power brands maintained or gained share.

 

Our full-year sales outlook remains unchanged and demerger plans remain firmly on track.

We're making good progress on standing up to functions and building the future processes needed to be a separate Company.

 

Finally, I'm looking forward to sharing more information with you on this incredible business as we move closer to separation and at our Capital Markets Day in Q1 next year.

Through the two largest Consumer Healthcare transactions in the last 6 years, we've created a great business, the global leader in Consumer Healthcare with a fantastic portfolio of brands and strong capabilities to drive sustainable market outperformance.

 

With that, I will hand it over to Iain.

Please turn to Slide 14.

 



Iain Mackay

Thanks, Brian.

 

As I cover the financials, references to growth are constant exchange rates unless stated otherwise.

Please turn to Slide 15.

 

This is a summary of the group's results for Q3 and the year-to-date.

In Q3, turnover was 9.1 billion pounds up 10%, and adjusted operating profit was 2.9 billion tons up 16%.

 

Total earnings per share was 23.3 tons up 3%, while adjusted earnings per share was 36.6 up 10%.

And the year-to-date turnover was 24.6 billion pounds up 3%, and adjusted operating profit was 6.9 billion tons up 8%.

 

Total EPS was 72.7p down 19%, and adjusted EPS was 87.7p up 5%.

In currency, there was a headwind of 5% of sales and 7% in adjusted earnings per share, in particular due to the strengthening of sterling against the US dollar relative to the third quarter of last year.

 

Slide 16 summarizes the reconciliation of our total to adjusted sales.

The adjusting items note for the quarter was intangible impairments, which primarily reflected the results and determination of the agreement with Merck KGaA on Bintrafusp Alpha.

 

My comments from here onwards are an adjusted results unless stated otherwise.

Turning to slide 17, The key drivers of revenues and profits for the group in Q3 compared to the prior year centered here.

 

Revenues grew 10% overall.

Excluding revenues from our COVID solutions, sales were up 8%.

 

The positive operating leverage from higher sales in the quarter was bolstered by continued focus on cost control and the benefits of restructuring across the group.

This was alongside the expected 15% increase in R&D investment.

 

Result in Q3 margin was 31.7% and year-to-date margin 8.1%.

We now expect R&D to grow high single-digits in the full year, reflecting upskilled investments balance from the continued realization of efficiencies with our approach to one R&D.

 

Moving to bottom half of the P&L on Slide 18.

I'd highlight that the effective tax rate of 20.6, was higher than last year and reflected the timing of settlements with the TDS tax authorities.

 

We still expect the full-year effective tax rate to be around 18%.

We also still expect interest expense to be between 800 million pounds and 850 million pounds.

 

I'll briefly cover free cash flow for the quarter before going into more detail on the financials of each business.

Turning to Slide 19.

 

In the year-to-date, we generated 1.5 billion kinds of free cash flow.

The main posted factors were increased adjusted operating profit at constant exchange rates, lower dividends to non-controlling interest, and lower tax payments mainly in the U.S.

 

versus the comparative period.

The primary factors more than offsetting this were increased purchase of intangible assets, including our collaborations with Alector and iTeos.,adverse timing of returns and rebates compared to 2020 and adverse exchange impacts.

 

Improving cash-flow performance continues to be a constant focus for the team.

And pleasingly, we're ahead of expectations for the year.

 

However, we do still expect this year to be a significant step-down versus 2020.

Turning to performance of the Pharma business in Slide 20.

 

Overall, pharmaceutical revenues grew to 10% driven by strong growth in new and specialty medicines, favorable U.S.

return and rebate adjustments, and sales of Xevudy in the quarter, which contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth.

 

And year-to-date, overall revenues grew 5%, and we're raising our expectations for sales, to increase low single-digits in the full year, excluding Xevudy sales.

Within this, we still expect established pharma sales to climb high single-digits in 2021.

 

The Pharma operating margin was 29.4% in Q3, and 29.2% year-to-date.

The increase in Q3 primarily reflect the positive operating leverage from increased sales, as well as continued tight cost control and restructuring benefits.

 

These positive margin dynamics were delivered alongside our focus on increasing R&D investment, which grew 11% in the quarter.

The prior-year comparative included the recognition of pre -launch inventory for Blenrep, which was a credit of slightly over 13 million tons.

 

Please turn to Slide 21.

This is an overview of vaccines performance with overall sales growth of 13%, excluding pandemic adjuvant, revenue sales growth was 8% primarily driven by Shingrix in the quarter, which we described earlier.

 

In the year-to-date, total vaccines revenues were up 5% and down 2%, excluding pandemic adjuvant sales.

With sales year-to-date and the strong Q4 comparator, particularly for Shingrix, we now expect vaccine sales to decline mid-single-digits this year, excluding pandemic adjuvant.

 

This has no impact on our mid-term expectations for the vaccines business, so we continue to be very confident in the demand for our products and high single-digit growth outlook.

Notably with regards to the Shingrix, where we've said the ambition of doubling sales by 2026.

 

The operating margin was 47.5%.

The increase in operating profit and margin primarily reflected the positive operating leverage from sales growth with positive mix, as well as higher royalty income.

 

Partly offsetting this was increase R&D investment of 46% as we progressed our RSV and Meningitis development programs and invested in our MRNA plus.

The year-to-date operating margin was 37.3%.

 

Please turn to Slide 22.

Q2 revenues in Consumer Healthcare increased 10%, excluding brands, either divested are under review.

 

Including those brands, turnover grew 8%, and Brian outlined the main drivers earlier.

In year-to-date revenues excluding brands either divested, are under review in [Indiscernible].

 

The operating margin for Q3 was 25.9% up 420 basis points at constant exchange rates versus last year.

Year-to-date operating margin was 23.6%.

 

Consumer in the full year, excluding brands divested are under review, we continue to expect lower to mid single-digit percentage revenue growth.

Turning to Slide 23.

 

Considerations for 2021 outlook.

Following our strong performance in the year-to-date, we're now confident that we can improve our full-year guidance.

 

As a result of continued commercial execution, sustained delivery of tight cost control, and the anticipated dynamics for Q4, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be between MiSeq and -4% in constant exchange rates, excluding the impact of COVID solutions.

We also expect COVID solutions to contribute approximately 7 to 9 percentage points of earnings growth in the full year, following better-than-expected progress on Xevudy contracting.

 

It's worth noting that the outcome within that range is still dependent on pandemic action contracting for 2022, and the resulting potential charges within cost of goods sold as we continue to manufacture for this potential.

Key factors that includes Q4 where we deliver in the full-year rate, will continue to be the friend and adult vaccination rates within the context of COVID-19 -- of the COVID environment, The relative phasing of launch investments to generate future growth, and effective tax rate.

 

We'll keep you informed of our progress in executing against our strategy through events, such as the HIV Update, Deborah referred to and the upcoming Investor Science Event for [Indiscernible].

We hope you will be able to join us for these events.

 

In summary, we believe the business momentum from an excellent work of our teams sets us up for a step change in growth in 2022, which is both an exciting and important year for the Company.

We'll provide formal guidance for 2022 with our full-year 2021 results in February.

 

Overall, an encouraging quarter and posted momentum.

With that Operator, we're ready for Q&A.

 
Operator

Thank you very much.

 

Your first question in the queue comes from James Gordon from JP Morgan.

You are live in the call.

 

Please go ahead.



James Gordon

Hello, James Gordon from JP Morgan.

 

Thanks for taking the questions.

First question is on OpEx.

 

So to reiterate your comments about meaningful operating margin expansion next year, but SG&A was 5% below and already 8% below our expectations today.

The question is, how much is low OpEx about cost avoidance versus structure changes at the Company?

 

And as we look into next year from the high er base, when you talk about meaningful expansion, can you just 100s basis points of EBITDA margin expansion next year?

Or could it be a bit of catch up if things get back to with COVID and you have to stop spending more.

 

So that's the first question, please.

Second question was about Consumer separation.

 

A couple of weeks ago, Greenberg was reporting that the Consumer Division could attract bids from PE firms or other pharma consumer companies.

So have you had recent informal expressions of interest in the Consumer business, and are discussions ongoing in parallel with the separation process you've described, or is that story inaccurate or [Indiscernible] happen historically, and it's definitively just the separation process described.

 

And I actually [Indiscernible] a clarification, I saw a comment about price range of the US consumer.

Are you able to tell us what the price or it is all that you put through in October in consumer, and how do you see the pricing power of the business go-forward, please.

 



Emma Walmsley

Great.

 

Thanks.

Thanks very much.

 

I'll just comment on the separation first of all.

And as I outlined today, we are very committed to the demerger of at least 80% of our holding in consumer.

 

We are absolutely on the runway for that.

We've had tremendous amounts of positive feedback from investors who are interested in owning this business and really looking forward to sharing with you in Q1 with the management team.

 

The prospects for that business, and much more detail on its competitive advantage and the strength of the brand portfolio.

We've consistently said that we will seek to monetize in a timely and pragmatic manner the up to 20% remaining part of our portfolio, part of our shareholding in that business.

 

And we are just really focused.

Of course, the Board will always do it's fiduciary duty, but we are really focused on the significant amount of work that's delivering on this separation and the tremendous value unlock that's going to bring.

 

I'll let Iain comment on the dynamics of OpEx, although I know his first answer's going to be with guidance for 2020.

And then Brian, could come back with some specifics on the price because we do think we're a bit advantaged on that dynamic versus some other consumer companies.

 

But Iain, first to you.



Iain Mackay

I hate it's all predictable.

 

James, thanks for your questions.

We will absolutely provide detailed outlooks for 2022 in early February '22 when we get there.

 

On your OpEx questions, so I think one of the things that's really important to note, which is true across the business over the course of this year and last, is it's just a very strong focus we've gotten time cost control across really every line within the P&L, whether it's within our cost of goods sold and great products, both within the far block, across the pharma, vaccines, and consumer healthcare businesses.

Really from within the manufacturing sites through the logistics and to our main storage areas.

 

Also from an SG&A perspective.

And then notably within R&D, continuing to keep moving our trials, moving along at pace, sometimes in quite an operating -- difficult operating environment, but also realizing benefits through our approach to one R&D, that's how and his team have been living.

 

There is another factor that has continued to play a part in 2021, and that is lower expense in line items.

For example, in travel and related expenses, where frankly our level of such activities are continuing to be fairly constrained in the current pandemic environment.

 

In terms of how we see this moving through the rest of the year, we will, as I mentioned in my comments here, continue to invest behind launches with a focus on driving growth and good momentum going into 2022, we continue to grow our investments in R&D as you've seen, this quarter, and we will continue to grow investment into non A and D through the fourth quarter and into 2022 as well.

But as I say, will provide more detail on that when we offer 2022 guidance in February next year.

 



Emma Walmsley

Thanks Iain and Brian on pricing and cost [Indiscernible].

 



BrianMcNamara

Yeah.

 

Thanks, James.

I mean, first I just reinforce, I feel very good about the top-line growth in the business and the fact that we're seeing momentum across brands and categories from Q1, Q2, then Q3.

 

On pricing, we have taken pricing across regions and categories.

Most recently, we took pricing in the U.S.

 

in October.

And the U.S.

 

price increases were mid-to-high single-digits on brands that represent about 50% of our sales, so brands like Sensodyne, Parodontax, Emergen-C, and Tums.

While it's never easy to take pricing in the U.S.

 

environment, we had good acceptance on the pricing.

We're also taking pricing across Europe and have been successful in taking pricing in China also.

 

And maybe for perspective, in the quarter with our 10% growth, we saw about a quarter of that growth come from price with about three quarters coming from volume growth.

And I'm confident, going forward, we have the ability to take price.

 

We have great brands with great equity, strong innovation, and that puts us in a very good position.



Emma Walmsley

Yeah, and the other aspect of that is we're less exposed on input costs.

 

I think the num some other consumer goods companies buy from the size of our products and things, but 10% reserve share of our sales come about to so, that's important to be aware of.

Next question, please.

 
Operator

Thanks very much.

 

Your next question on the line, comes from the line of Peter Holford from Jefferies ph.

You're live in the call.

 

Please go ahead.



Peter Holford

Thanks for taking my questions.

 

So seeking to firstly, I think will how just wonder if you can comment a bit on dream five.

We saw some headlines about on from two partners spring books of this.

 

Would, if you can just comment in terms of what you see in the encouraging early data with the Cabot secretase inhibitor, most probably to the expansion of this study.

What we should perhaps you're thinking about in terms of next steps of what you're looking forward and that's expansion cohorts, And then secondly, just want -- I guess for Iain, just on the EPS outlook.

 

Just to be clear, could you just outline in the time you've given for EPS, does that at the moment include any talks, write-downs, for the pandemic adjuvant, or is that -- does that explain, if you like, the 7% to 9% Delta.

And perhaps you could just explain what they say, applied sales are of...?

 

pandemic adjuvant within that 7% to 9% range.

Thank you.

 



Emma Walmsley

Okay.

 

Well, let's come to Hal first, and please.



Hal Barron

Thank you for your question Peter.

 

As you know, the functional genomic data that we generated was very suggestive that there would be synergy between a gamma - secretase inhibitor and blend rep due to its inhibition of the cleaving of the BCMA protein from those surface plasma cells, and that's what was being tested in the sub study of the dream five to see if a dose blend rep, which we studied at 0.92 milligrams per kilogram, Q3 weeks would be active on top of a GSI.

We know from the dream one study, although limited numbers of patients that such adults would have limited if any activity?

 

We studied to see if the combination of a gamma-secretase plus blend rep at this low dose would induce meaningful responses, And as we said, that the data, although preliminary, is very encouraging and it has led to us on getting the expansion phase of this program.

And in that expansion, we're going to be comparing it in randomized way so that we can get more robust data, whether the 0.9 mgs per kg dose of BLENREP given 2, 3 weeks with the GSI is how it compares to the standard approved dose of 2.5 mgs per kg 2, 3 weeks in a -- as monotherapy in the refractory setting.

 



Emma Walmsley

Iain.

 



Iain Mackay

Yes.

 

On EPS and specifically any elements coming through COGS on adjuvant sales.

No, we've absolutely fulfilled the obligations and expectations for adjuvant sales for 2021 with no adverse impacts coming through cost of goods sale sold.

 

As I mentioned in my comments, Peter, in terms of whether there will be any impact in the fourth quarter, or for that matter next year, is really very much about the antigen contribution based on the outcomes of the Phase III studies that we've got going on with a number of partners, 2 of which I think Sanofi and Medicago we'd expect a readout in the fourth quarter and one in the first part of next year from SK Bio.

So at this point, nothing adverse coming through cost of goods sold as it relates to that.

 

In terms of Xevudy, we've got contracted more than 420,000 doses, and we have reserved, with agreements being negotiated presently of more than 220,000 doses, those negotiations ongoing with a number of governments.

You'll have noticed within the quarter we recognized a PS114 million of revenue from those -- from part of those 420 contract, and all that 420 obviously.

 

And clearly, Luke and the team continue to pursue contracting opportunities for this important treatment for COVID-19 aggressively, because it clearly has a very beneficial effect conceivably on impacted patients.

But that's really the dosage outlook that we've got in terms of contracted and reserved at this point in time, Peter.

 



Emma Walmsley

Thanks.

 

Next question, please.
Operator

Thank you very much.

 

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Purcell from Morgan Stanley.

You are live in the call.

 

Please go ahead.



Mark Purcell

Thank you very much for taking my questions.

 

First on RSV for old adults.

Timelines shifted forward from the second half of next year to the first half of next year.

 

Could you help us understand whether this is a function of speed of recruitment or higher implied infection rates at the trial sites, and could it competitive dynamics here with 2 other players in pivotal trials.

And then secondly, there's been a little press recently around COVID vaccines and raised concerns around the relatively narrow neutralizing antibody response such as the S-protein.

 

With natural inflection, you're seeing much high-levels of event and protein antibodies, for example.

So when it comes to sort of next-generation approaches, are you considering with your partners developing COVID vaccines against the broader range of protein targets beyond just the S-protein.

 

Thank you.



Emma Walmsley

Thanks.

 

Two questions to Hal, please.



Hal Barron

Thanks, Mark, for the great questions.

 

First to talk about RSV.

Very excited about the opportunity here of course.

 

Because of the significant unmet medical need that RSV represents with I think as you know, more than a 175 thousand patients in the United States alone being hospitalized and 14 thousand deaths, something that compares very, in some respect towards been flu.

Our program is actually progressing very well.

 

And the increase in timelines, I mean sorry, the decrease movement forward and timeline, is really completely driven by operational efficiencies and our ability to enroll more aggressively.

Of course, is going to be an event-driven trial and so events will matter, but the timeline shift is simply due to better execution and acceleration.

 

I think the second question was about COVID and the impact of neutralizing antibodies, whether they be from vaccines or endogenous infections.

And I think it's an opportunity to highlight that you have the immune response generated from the various vaccines does differ.

 

And as variant s start emerging, the response and the neutralizing titers to each of these sub components is different.

And this is why we're very excited about our protein with the adjuvant as a vaccine.

 

And I think we'll have data for that in the coming months.

So we're very excited to see what neutralizing antibody titers and how they compare to other vaccines that are available today.

 

Because there could be, as you say, an opportunity for broader spectrum response with mRNA.

As you know, we are pursuing a collaboration with CureVac, and we have a second-generation approach where we're using this so-called optimized five-prime, three-prime to make sure the transcripts are more stable and therefore protein expressions higher.

 

We're also exploring a version of that with both unmodified as well as modified to see what the incremental contribution of modified is.

And pending that data of course, there's opportunities to be able to explore creating transcripts to any of the variances that emerge, to be able to focus -- the neutralizing Convers on any variance.

 

So it's an exciting technology and we're excited to be playing a major role.



Emma Walmsley

Next question, please.

 
Operator

Thank you very much.

 

Your next question comes from the line of Simon Martha from Exane.

You are live in the call, please go ahead.

 



Simon Martha

No.

 

Thank you, everybody for taking the questions.

So first one's for Deborah, actually.

 

And just looking at HIV, obviously developers are doing exceptionally well, now it's driving new growth in the ViiV division overall.

I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts about the future potential threat from dolutegravir.

 

I think two days ago I think we saw headline results that Aluminite switched to these seem to be non-inferior to the current best-in-cost treatment opportunity.

So basically, just talking through the opportunity that you still seeing the 2 drug regimen and the threat of so you might see from, could be great.

 

The second one maybe for Luke, just maybe if you could give us an update on your views around the commercial opportunity for dock produced.

I think originally, this are very bullish expectations, but it's an negation could offer and all helps them to site for the Obviously, competitive edge doesn't seem that is the case.

 

I'm just wondering if you could maybe talk to the competitive today opportunity charting the commercial opportunity for that produce stuff.

Thank you.

 



Emma Walmsley

Right, won't talk much leaders.

 



Deborah Waterhouse

Great, thanks for the question.

 

So first of all, I think, when we think about Apple 30, and you're right about it.

It's had a very good quarter.

 

We're really proud of our innovation leadership in the development of two-drug regimen in the mortgage therapies.

And I think you can see our competitors following us, and you say, the -- those studies out this week.

 

The headline level for Merck in two-drug regimen in the switch to that setting.

If we think about the label that DevOps has, basically we have the Gemini studies in naive out to 3 years, which had non-inferiority that's it Dolutegravir-based three-drug regimen.

 

Then you got the time guys in the switch testing.

Again, days dropped to 3 years with no confirmed virologic failures .

 

And then we recently published our SALSA study, which was a second switch study, but to a similar stomach from where it was an ARZ that is to monetize study.

Again, we saw no concerned theological, studies of off -take 3-48 weeks.

 

All that data has really I think led to a great deal of confidence in Devanto by physicians that you now seeing not convert into prescribing.

And we see the Devanto It's on all the major guidelines recommended for both naive and switch.

 

However, I do think having a competitor coming into the market, who is following gone from us on this also, really in the future going to primate to drug regimens, I think it helps move the market to drug regimens because if you think about the US, the moment, less than 5% have converted over to we devour to high than not in Europe, but it's a journey that's moving at pace but it's probably slower than we would like to see.

So I think that would be very helpful in reshaping the market and building a more confidence in two-drug regimen.

 

And to me, the question we should ask ourselves, every single day is why somebody living with HIV type 3 medicines when two is all they need an will not based stocking has a huge potential to drug regimens and I think Devops a very bright future.

We'll see what our competitors bring in following on from us.

 



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Deborah, Luke, on dapro.

 



Luke Miels

Thanks, Simon.

 

I'm going to think if you -- if we all went back 18 months ago, I don't think many people would have expected that dapro would be one of one or maybe one of two hits in the U.S.

So I think that's driven a reappraisal of the potential for that reagent in the U.S.

 

and also Europe.

I think it's going to be driven -- the potential is largely going to be driven by the type of label that we get.

 

Overall, of course, safety being the key element there.

particularly in the non-dialysis population where a number of companies with E pose, including long-acting, E poses, we've tried to penetrate that area and it's been a bit of a challenge.

 

If you look at the numbers long term, we estimate by 2030 that the about 8 million CKD patients who are nay mix are less than 12.

On the label that we expect initially outside that 3 million has to be the eligible.

 

You got about a third of that with dialysis and this is U.S.

and EU5.

 

The potential is certainly there, but I think it's going to depend on how the regulators treat it.

I think also we're expecting publications around the ASN academic event.

 

And I think the treatment through the editorials to also be very influential there.

So very positive, but we just need to see how the frame lands.

 

There's clearly a high demand for these products.

EPOs have limitations, particularly in this non-dialysis setting.

 

And we're very focused on ensuring that we make the maximum opportunities from this product.



Emma Walmsley

Thanks Luke, Next question, please.

 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Graham Parry from Bank of America.

 

You are live in the call.

Please go ahead.

 



Graham Parry

Great.

 

Thanks for taking my questions.

Fiscally on Shingrix in your commentary on 2022 deferred sales, and you guided that the strong double-digit growth and record sales and if I look at consensus at the moment, that's probably pointing to 2.5 billion or close to, 50% of where your current guide is, does that fit within what you define as a strong double-digit envelope, and then secondly on RC vaccine, if you're pulling for to first-half twenty two, just on enrollments, could higher RC incident see that land that they saw early as key 1 and perhaps just help us understand where you see differentiation now where you've started to see more data from the competitors in the clinic with days from Faiza, J&J, Moderna all out there now, particularly in terms of the implications of your adjuvant, but also not targeting our CB with you a vaccine?

 

Thank you.



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Graham.

 

Well, we're not going to outline specific guidance for Shingrix in '22 today, but Luke may bear you just reiterating some of the underlying both consumer and commercial dynamics on that.

And then let's hear both from Hal on the overall kind of underpinning scientific differentiators.

 

But also I think we could hear from Roger on how we see the prospects of the RSV market playing out.

But first, to Luke, please.

 



Roger Connor

Sure.

 

Thanks Emma.

Thanks, Graham.

 

I mean, if you look at demand for the Shingrix in the second half of this year, it's been clearly correlated with outbreak of Delta, which I mean is -- I think is logical and the people don't want to go into retail pharmacies, if there's a deal throughout break in the area and we follow that at a state level each week, and the patent its very, very clear.

Now what is interesting is when we look at leading indicators like, for example, Google search tools, churches of the highest level were seeing for shingles in the last couple of weeks.

 

If you look at the script trends that we're now starting to see, these are also very encouraging.

And a key point on the script trends, and I mentioned in my commentary at the start, we -- when we saw the impact of COVID vaccines and just the need for retail pharmacy to deploy infrastructure staff to give those vaccines, we made a decision and it was a risky at the time, but it's played out to promote Shingrix in the second slot on the Trelegy team, targeting HCPs in their offices.

 

And normally, that's about a third of shots that are given are HCPs, and about two-thirds of retail.

What we're seeing right now is that's more 50-50, which means that you see an under-reporting of the TRX levels because they're more efficiently captured in retail.

 

So these are all encouraging.

Emma mentioned the market research that says when we ask people who've been vaccinated for COVID, so they tend to be motivated adults.

 

They list Shingrix as the second vaccine they want to get after flu.

These are all pointing in the right direction.

 

I think if you look outside the U.S.

we'll be in 17 markets at the year-end, with 35 added over the next three years.

 

We had a very strong start in Germany, that was disrupted by COVID vaccines and outbreaks that is now returning.

Germany bid the second match market next year.

 

These are only elements that underlie our confidence there.

People may have questions around the inventory.

 

The inventory is very much in the range, that it's been historically.

In the past, we've seen it dropped down to say point 5 point 7 million doses.

 

But the range at normally stays in is just over a million.

And we have a lot of parakeet managing that very tightly because of the past supply problems to right now it's very much within the million doses, very much under control and feedback from retail pharmacists.

 

and 80 pages is continued to mind.

I think the hypothesis of DMARD demand remains robust.

 



Emma Walmsley

Thank Logan and Hal and then Roger.

 



Hal Barron

Thanks, Graham.

 

We're all very excited about the RSV program and the changes we've made in the development organization to be able to speed this up from an operational efficiency perspective.

But as you point out, there's other contributors to when we'll be able to see the data including of that rates.

 

We are -- so that is one of the dependencies to see how many events we haven't.

And I should say the third aspect of when we will be able to see data is driven by being able to see the duration of the effect.

 

of the -- making sure we have a broad section of the season so that we can understand the effect over time.

And all three of those things go into one, we will see data, but we're confident it will be in the first half now.

 

As far as differentiators, we see this very important component of why we use the adjuvant.

If you think about this disease, it's really prominent in those over 65 because as you age, your immune system becomes somehow less able to amount the appropriate B-cell response, the neutralizing antibody titers, but also to mount an effective T-cell response, the cellular immunity.

 

And what we've seen over and over in vaccine development with other diseases, and what was confirmed in our Phase II data is that the adjuvant that we're using is actually very effective at sort of normalizing, if you will, the T-cell response.

And when you look at some of the competitors, that don't have that, it's not clear from the data generated whether the immune response that's generated in the elderly will be effective as the one we can generate with an adjuvant.

 

So, we see that as a differentiating feature, it is not just true with this vaccine, but our whole adjuvant platform.

The other point is that we have looked very carefully at the neutralizing levels of neutralizing antibody levels towards both RSV, Protein A and B,the -- the different epitopes of the two viruses and we see a very effective neutralizing antibody to both, by the Priya fusion protein.

 

So we are expecting that will be very effective at both variants, and as I said with the adjuvant being able to mount the T-cell response, which we think will both have a broader antibody spectrum, as well as possibly a greater duration of effect leading to a differentiated vaccine on that.

So pleased about speed, pleased about the science, and hopefully we will see that translate into a very effective vaccine quite soon.

 

Roger, do you want to add a little more to that on the commercial side.



Roger Connor

Yeah.

 

Just very quickly highlight.

I think you've touched on the excitement.

 

We've got the market size here is really significant, 1 billion people more than 60 years old.

We believe there is a major opportunity.

 

I don't think people really realize again that the hospitalization burden on this is higher than flu.

So we have real opportunity.

 

We believe to come in and take a significant part of what is a big market



David Redfern

as, as well a couple of points, DAP, we'll be looking at to potentially drive differentiations, regional protection, as Hal mentioned, linked to that adjuvant as well.

 

I wouldn't underestimate the importance of our CFD record on our ASO adjuvant as well, we've now given us the more than 25 million people as well.

So again, Singling off the Sync-Rx history there and we knew the old Rabo market through Sync-Rx as well, south and Dillard, positive that we want to apply just correctly on supply as well.

 

We're investing at PS and advanced to be ready for this vaccine as well.

We obviously stepped tuned in Shingrix capacity recently, this is the CM technology platform.

 

We got a double while many benefit by improving Shingrix we also got to step in our RSV capacity as well, which is great, which means that we are going to be ready for this launch as well.



Emma Walmsley

All right.

 

So the next question, please.
Operator

Thank you very much.

 

Your next question on the line comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim.

You are live in the call.

 

Please go ahead.



Seamus Fernandez

Great.

 

Thanks so much for the questions.

So I just wanted to go back to the gamma-secretase, just hoping you'd get to help us understand when you might be sharing the combo data that you have so far and how you see the combos fitting in relative to some of the other Phase 2 expansions that you've started.

 

I'd just note the DREAMM-14 study has a number of different doses and schedules with BLENREP.

And then my second question is really on the process of the demerger itself.

 

There has been some speculation and questions around the value of potentially shifting gears to an IPO.

Just wondering if you could either confirm or deny that possibility.

 

It seems like you're quite far down the path with a straight demerger spin.

And just hoping to get a little bit of clarity there given some speculation in market.

 

Thanks so much.



Emma Walmsley

Yeah, Seamus.

 

So I can be really quick on your second question and then hand back to how on BLENREP, but just to repeat what I've already said.

We are very committed to the demerger of at least 80% of our holidaying.

 

We've had very positive levels of interest from our shareholders, and then we're looking at a timely and pragmatic monetization of the remaining 20% and we are on the runway and with really focused on exiting that brilliantly.

Hal over to you on the various approaches to maximizing Mac.

 



Hal Barron

Thanks, James.

 

When you look at the strategy we have for maximizing the opportunity for blend rep in patients.

It's important to remember that the risk benefit for myeloma patient changes according to a lot of therapy that we're we're studying.

 

So when we think about studying the second third outlying patients such as dream 3, we're going head-to-head with pomalidomide June 7th, and 8th, where we're going h ead to head with VELCADE and DARZALEX.

We're doing a number of things.

 

First of all, we're trying to be superior to pretty effective standard of care.

And in that setting, we're really focusing on optimizing efficacy.

 

As we think about trying to reduce some of the ocular toxicity that we're seeing, we really have a four-pronged approach of which gamma-secretase plays one role.

But we're really looking to see if we can lower the dose, as we've seen in the Algonquin study to doses like 1.9 migs per kig, where when we give it with standard of care therapies such as pomalidomide in other drugs that are approved.

 

And we think that by lowering the dose, we might be able to reduce ocular toxic.

We also know that there is an opportunity and what we've seen some of this data later this year on the impact of changing the schedule, and by that, I mean moving from a Q3 week to a Q4 week, maybe even Q6 week or even Q8 week dosing regimen, where the peak trough (ph) ratio changes and exposure changes in a way that we -- we hope might reduce ocular tox, and of course we have the opportunity to think about how we alter the schedule as it relates to dose holding.Currently the approved regimen as demonstrated in the program on dream 2, we tend to hold the dose when patients develop, whether they are symptomatic or not.

 

A great three keratopathy, there's an opportunity to alter that holding pattern to say great to keratopathy, to prevent further development.

And so we're exploring those 3 different levers, if you will, on how to optimize in combination with this very intriguing concept of being able to lower the dose by inhibiting gamma-secretase, which as I mentioned earlier, is responsible for clipping off the BCMA off the plasma cell.

 

And by inhibiting that, increasing expression.

And by doing so, maybe allowing equivalent efficacy at a lower dose.

 

So those are the four levers to reduce ocular toxin, of course, at the same time, designing trials to show superiority in head-to-head trials, like I mentioned, in DREAMM 3, 7, and 8.

So a number of different strategies all being modular to some extent, and depending on the patient population that can come in at meds, and most importantly, the line of therapy, we're mixing and matching those to optimize the program.

 



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Hal.

 

Next question, please.
Operator

Thank you very much.

 

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum from city.

You are live in the call, please go ahead.

 



Andrew Baum

Thank you.

 

A couple of questions.

Emma, has this thing very Caseli to your comments at the beginning of the call, and you described GSK is being agile in terms of COVID opportunities.

 

One of your existing partners there, long-standing one has a novel non - paying stayed protease inhibitor for COVID.

I'm just intrigued if you've got to comment on the relative level of interest given Shionogi has talked to partnering the asset with a global partner and it's difficult to think of someone better equipped than GSK.

 

Second, again this thing to your answer to the question about private equity and the story that was on Bloomberg last week.

You have juxtaposed to your response about timely monetization of your stake.

 

But the IPO or the sale of stock from GSK that you don't demerge potentially creates an overhang until it's put into the market.

Are there potential creative solutions one may think about.

 

And I'm particularly thinking about, by which an overhang could be taken away and yet GSK could have access to capital early in order to facilitate business development.

Thank you.

 



Deborah Waterhouse

Yeah, well, Andrew, My reference to agility on COVID was frankly because it was less about, and I'm not going to comment on any specific potential additional partnership or not, but it was much more about how the environment around COVID vaccination continues to change as data emerges all of the time.

 

And obviously the first question is, how do you contribute to the pandemic.

Then the question is, what is the shape of an endemic specific market for COVID.

 

And then the question is, how do we all learn, and how will GSK continue to lead the way in terms of a broad technology platform.

And it's that kind of agility to make sure we keep adjusting, and the thoughtfulness on how we are approaching mRNA as Hal learnt earlier in terms of looking the proof of the platform within, COVID, because you can imagine a better global data than we have now.

 

But I want to modify that no unmodified basis.

And then also, looking at potential combos, we have said, we're looking to be in the clinic around COVID and flu by next summer.

 

And then we've got, I think another 6 possibilities over the next 4 years.

So lots of learning continuing on, MRNA opportunities, and that's where we want to bring our agility.

 

I think it'll be fed say that they global level of supply around pandemic vaccines, even if such low percentages the developing world vaccinated so far is such a So I don't think that 's so much the primary question.

Although obviously we'll be thrilled to contribute not at least through COVAX as our pricing adjuvant readouts come and that we're dependent on our antigen partners in terms of their capacity to supply.

 

And on your other question, I mean, one of the key reasons for retaining up to 20% was precisely as you referred to the additional opportunity beyond the initial deleveraging with the transfer of that to further strengthen our balance sheet and be able to keep investing in our number one priority.

We've said in a timely and pragmatic manner.

 

And we will be timely and pragmatic, all about maximizing value.

I have to say in terms of the prospects of the Consumer business, we really do feel confident that this is going to be an appealing stock and hopefully will bring a lot more visibility to that in Q1.

 



Emma Walmsley

Next question, please.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Your next question comes from the line of Laura Sutcliffe from UBS.

You are live in the call.

 

Please go ahead.



Laura Sutcliffe

Hello, thank you.

 

Could you help us understand how Shingrix is working in the real world and the retail setting at the moment a little bit further.

So if a patient who's receiving a flu vaccine or a COVID vaccine makes it as far as the retail pharmacy, are they a person who is a likely candidate to get Shingrix at that time or someone who is avoiding getting Shingrix at that time?

 

And then for Deborah on HIV, the -- on your third generation integrase inhibitor with Shionogi, could you tell us what routes of administration you think might be possible for that molecule.

Thanks.

 



Emma Walmsley

Right, So Luke, an endeavor, please.

 



Luke Miels

Sure.

 

So Laura, great question.

I mean, if you could someone presents seeking a COVID-19 vaccine, I think the key parameter is just the history of mentioned in the past.

 

So if there's someone that regularly came for flu shot, then they're likely to be more receptive on the part of the pharmacist.

It depends then on how much time that individual has at that point, and also how busy the pharmacist is.

 

Of course, if there's 10 people lining up for COVID shot then the opportunity to discuss the benefits of being vaccinated for shingles is less.

In that case though, the retail pharmacists have incentives through the major change in the U.S to re-book that patient, to come back to the retail pharmacy on another day and receive that vaccination.

 

Or they can give those doses concomitantly, which I said has indicated their comfortable with, we're also running a study with Moderna COVID vaccine that will readout in Q1 of 22 just to build some more evidence around that co-administration.

And then the other train, which I think is just encouraging that I didn't mention earlier, is around seven out of ten, shots right now for Shingrix, either first shot and we now 90% of people so far come back for the second shot.

 

So it's their history of vaccination and how much time does that does the individual having the pharmacist had and then usually the aim is to rebook them to come back.



Deborah Waterhouse

Helpful.

 

That's great [Indiscernible] I currently feet fairly as having integrated inhibitors at the core, and they really are the premium goal standard of therapy in the field today.

And we believe in the future, they're supported by guidelines, by a significant amount of really strong data.

 

And you've got, I think, more than 18 million people living with HIV, say, taking the second-generation integrase inhibitor.

So our core belief is that if you're going to be successful, it 's very important to have a strong and robust integrase inhibitor at the core of your regimen.

 

So then if I think about what Shionogi offers, the Shionogi integrase inhibitor has the potential to be ultra long - acting, and it will also have a unique resistance profile., so by the time we get to 2030, Undoubtedly, some resistance will have emerged to the second-generation integrated such as dolutegravir and bictegravir.

So this unique resistance profile, it's going to be very, very valuable.

 

We believe the opportunity to really harness the OEP long-acting potential is to have it as a subcutaneous or intramuscular.

And so what we would do is we now to start the development journey of that medicine, is to explore both of those options.

 

But we don't see it as an oral, we're very much looking at it as a subcut or an intramuscular injection.



Emma Walmsley

Thanks Deborah.

 

So I think we have time for one last question today, and obviously we can do lots of follow up with you afterwards, but time for one last question, please.
Operator

Thanks very much.

 

Your last question on the line comes from the line of Kerry Holford from Berenberg.

You are live in the call.

 

Please go ahead.



Kerry Holford

Thank you very much.

 

Two questions [Indiscernible].I think you said diagnosis [Indiscernible] in various amount 15 level of seeing any signs of improvement and how it is something you expect to normalized orienting meetings next, essentially, when do you expect to step change in his agenda sales group trajectory.

And then based on Benlysta those questions.

 

any thoughts [Indiscernible] Phase three study failed to show any incremental benefit Benlysta mono.

Thank you.

 



Emma Walmsley

Let's go to Hal first, and the finish with Zejula.

 



Hal Barron

Hi, Kerry.

 

Thanks for the question.

I think the simplest answer is that Benlysta was not -- was a backbone for both arms, of course, and is a very effective therapy for these patients with lupus nephritis.

 

And essentially, rituximab, in the single-dose and the manner it was given just didn't add anything to Benlysta 's very effective management of these patients.



Emma Walmsley

Right.

 

Luke.



Luke Miels

Thanks, Kerry.

 

I think -- we're actually hoping to see a recovery by now, but then we saw the Delta version emerge and on Slide 26 in the appendix, we put the IQV out of it, just showing that relationship.

surgery did go up in August, we expect that posture restatement, but you can say obviously we hadn't got through the peak of Delta in the U.S.

 

in August.

Hopefully as we go into the northern hemisphere winter, we see a reduction, and with the boost of reduction in the number of cases in more of these, women present to the GPS and then are diagnosed of course, are very difficult tumor tumor to diagnose because the symptoms are quite diffused.

 

So that's the challenge.

The downstream effect then of course is typically they'll have 6 to 7 cycles of chemo.

 

So upon that initial debulking event, it's going to take another 6 months before they present to maintenance.

What we don't know is, are these women going to be -- by virtue of being diagnosed later, more progressed in their disease.

 

So, likely they relapse faster and therefore compress the total period of which they treated with the maintenance therapy.

So, it very much remains unknown.

 

When we do look at the patients that are coming through and being diagnosed, as I said earlier, we are very, very competitive in those new and emerging patients and continue to be so and continue to make the argument for the benefits of Zejula over the alternatives.



Emma Walmsley

Thank you.

 

In conclusion, it's a quarter where we've continued to deliver evidence that the hard work of the transformation program over the last four years is generating results.

We've got strong business performance, double-digit sales growth in pharma and vaccines and increased momentum and Consumer Health, Matt the upgrade to full-year guidance.

 

And alongside the progress in strengthening pipeline reinforces our confidence in the outlook for step changing growth and performance from 2022 and beyond.

And at the same time, we're very excited about the progress towards unlocking.

 

well, the shareholder value with the successful demerger in mid-2022, which is going to be a landmark year for our Company.

Thanks very much, everyone.

 

I look forward to following up with you in coming days.
Operator

For all our speakers, that concludes your conference call for today.

 

You may disconnect.

Thank for joining and enjoy the rest of your day.

Good morning and welcome to Moderna's Third Quarter Earnings Call.

 

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only-mode.

Following the formal remarks, we will open the call up for your questions.

 

Please be advised that the call is being recorded.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lavina Talukdar, Head of Investor Relations at Moderna.

 

Please go ahead, ma'am.



Lavina Talukdar

Thank you, operator.

 

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Moderna's third quarter 2021 financial results and business update.

You can access the press release we issued this morning, as well as the slides that we'll be reviewing by going to the Investors section of our website.

 

On today's call are Stéphane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; David Meline, our Chief Financial Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; and Paul Burton, our Chief Medical Officer.

Before we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Private Litigations Reform Act of 1995.

 

Please see slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.

On slide 3, please see the important indication and safety information for our COVID-19 vaccine, which has been authorized for emergency use in the United States and many countries around the world.

 

I will now turn the call over to Stéphane.



Stéphane Bancel

Thank you, Lavina.

 

Good morning or good afternoon, everyone.

Welcome to our Q3 2021 conference call.

 

Today, I will start by quick business review of the quarter before David presents the key financials.

Paul will then walk you through some real world evidence update.

 

And Stephen will provide the clinical development update.

I will then come back to close to share some thoughts about where we are heading.

 

Let's start on slide 5 with a holistic pipeline update.

First, respiratory vaccines.

 

We are pleased to have filed the BLA for COVID-19 vaccines with FDA and have now received a priority review designation.

We received our first full approval for Spikevax backs in Canada.

 

We received EUA from the FDA for the 50 microgram booster and mix and match has been authorized.

We also received authorization for boosters from our major geographies, EMA, UK and so on.

 

We were informed recently that FDA may take until January 2022 to review the EUA request for 12 to 17 years of age.

Turning now to flu.

 

mRNA-1010 is fully enrolled for Phase 1 and we expect human data soon now.

For RSV, mRNA-1345, after a very positive data in the Phase 1, with high neutralizing antibody levels after one dose, our teams are finalizing the preparation of a Phase II/III in older adults.

 

This study should start soon.

We also announced our development candidate for COVID booster plus flu booster in a single dose, mRNA 1073, which we anticipate will be in a clinic soon.

 

Let me now turn to vaccines against latent viruses.

As many of you know, latent viruses are a major cause of health problems.

 

Latent viruses are mainly made of DNA viruses.

And once a human is infected by a latent virus, that virus will stay in the body.

 

You are familiar with some latent viruses like HIV and HPV.

There are many other that helps humans.

 

As a company, we are committed to developing a portfolio of first-in-class vaccines and therapeutics against these latent viruses.

Our first programs are CMV vaccine, EBV vaccine, and EBV therapeutic vaccine.

 

We have also partnered to work on two HIV vaccines.

Last week marked a big milestone for Moderna.

 

We started dosing in the clinic the first participant of our Phase III pivotal registration study for CMV vaccines mRNA-1647.

This marks the second Phase III study that the company has started and brings us one step closer to getting another important vaccine to millions of people around the world.

 

For EBV vaccine, mRNA-1189 should start dosing for its Phase I very soon.

And our new development candidate on the EBV therapeutic vaccine, mRNA-1195 is moving toward the clinic.

 

Let me now turn to therapeutics.

Our personalized cancer vaccine is in Phase II [indiscernible] with KEYTRUDA monotherapy is fully enrolled.

 

And we expect data in the back end of 2022.

Our rare genetic programs continue to progress well in the clinic.

 

PA has its Phase I dose core fully enrolled.

MMA is dosing patients in its Phase I.

 

GSD1a has an open IND and has received orphan drug designation by the FDA.

So, as you can see, we have three rare genetic disease programs in the clinic or soon to be in the clinic.

 

So, we look forward to showing clinical data in the coming months.

We are very proud to have found a way to get Crigler-Najjar Type 1 or CN-1 to patients through a donation of our IP and the assets to the Institute for Life Changing Medicines.

 

CN-1 disease is an ultra-rare disease with very few patients afflicted around the world.

For ultra-rare disease, just the cost of clinical developments will result in a very high price for a few patients around the world that could benefit.

 

This model is not one that we support.

So instead of developing a drug and charging a very high price, we decided to give the drug away and innovate for a creative partnership.

 

We provide the drug to the institutes, we pay for clinical trial material, the institute pays for the clinical trial cost.

If the drug is approved, we'll provide the medicines to the kids and their families for free.

 

And we will not charge any royalty or milestone to the institutes.

We believe this is the right thing to do to continue to contribute to society for ultra-rare disease where our mRNA platform can help.

 

One of the important news items announced today is the introduction of a new modality through our existing six modalities.

We're very pleased to announce that Vertex and Moderna are now in GLP tox studies for the cystic fibrosis program, VXc-522.

 

This marks our first inhaled preliminary therapeutics program.

I would like to congratulate and thank our scientific team as well as the Vertex team for having been able to develop a novel lipid formulation to allow inhaled pulmonary delivery.

 

This is really exciting for patients.

As we communicated previously, in addition to doing therapeutics using mRNA coding for human proteins, like the ones I just described, we want to use our mRNA plus lipid technologies to develop therapeutics using mRNA coding for gene editing enzymes.

 

We are pleased to announce our first partnership in the field.

We announced earlier this week that we entered into a licensing collaboration with Metagenomi based in California to use their next generation gene editing enzymes.

 

We believe that that technology, coupled with our mRNA plus lipid technologies, and our manufacturing infrastructure will produce some exciting new medicines to take into the clinic.

I am very pleased with the progress of the company.

 

We are increasing depth in vaccines, and at the same time increasing breadth of application [indiscernible] and gene editing.

On slide 5, you will find financial highlights.

 

For Q3, we reported revenue of around $5 billion enabled by delivering 208 million doses of our COVID-19 vaccine.

Net income of $3.3 billion.

 

Our cash and cash equivalents position was $15 billion at the end of September.

Since the end of the quarter, we have been working to get better visibility into those variables that will impact our full year results.

 

And we have much better visibility today than we did a month ago.

For fiscal year 2021, we're updating the range of doses we plan to deliver to 700 million to 800 million doses.

 

The key variable of this update volume range are first, longer lead time for exports to countries outside the US and for international shipments in general.

In Q3, we shipped more deliveries to new international markets and expect Q4 to also have more international deliveries.

 

As we deliver to these countries for the first time, we expect the process to become more routine and delivery time to shorten.

However, some Q4 deliveries may still move to early 2022 as a result.

 

Second, in Q3, we have expanded our fill finish capacity with our manufacturing partners, which had the temporary impact on our shipments.

That work is complete now.

 

And we should see a positive impact from this expansion very soon.

Third, the bottleneck of production has moved down the manufacturing line to product release.

 

We added additional resources, skilled personnel to the release and of the manufacturing line.

And we expect to increase the weekly number of doses raised.

 

We believe resolution of these factors put us in a good position heading into Q4 and 2022.

Now if I turn to revenue for 2021.

 

The updated revenue range for 2021 is $15 billion to $18 billion.

This range reflects our updated delivery schedule with fewer doses delivered in 2021 as some doses are pushed into 2022.

 

And also, the pricing impact of prioritization delivery to COVAX and African Union that have a lower tier pricing.

On slide 7, let me start by summarizing the scale-up operational challenges that the team had to work through as we scaled from making less than 100,000 doses in 2019 to hundreds of millions of doses in 2021.

 

Q1 scale up challenges were around drug substance, making mRNA in lipids.

Q2 scale up challenges were on drug products and ensuring we could fill enough vials.

 

In the first half of the year, we made great progress in these challenges, as you can see from the numbers on the right.

We now have 901 million doses of drug substance that have been formulated [indiscernible] of mRNA products.

 

And we have 770 million doses of drug products already in vials.

Q3 scale-up challenges were on product release as the supply chain became more complex with increased deliveries to many countries around the world.

 

At the beginning of the year, we supplied just a few large countries.

As mentioned before, we are working through these challenges.

 

And as November 1, we achieved 566 million doses around the world.

With the progress year-to-date, we expect to be able to deliver 700 million to 800 million doses for full year 2021.

 

We were pleased to be named last week for the seventh year in a row as one of the top 20 biotech and pharmaceutical company in the world by Science.

We continue to invest in science and the culture of our team.

 

We aim at building the best mRNA science in the world, in the culture of boldness, collaboration, curiosity and relentlessness.

On slide 9, you will find our usual summary slide, which describes some of the key high-level attributes of the company as of today.

 

Now let me turn it over to David.



David Meline

Okay.

 

Thank you, Stéphane.

We're providing today the analysis of actual 2021 third quarter results, along with an updated view of key drivers of financial performance going forward.

 

Turning now to slide 11, starting with an overview of our sales performance before commenting more broadly on our financial results.

Total product sales in the third quarter were $4.8 billion, representing 208 million doses delivered to our customers.

 

This compares to sales of $4.2 billion and 199 million doses in Q2 and sales of $1.7 billion and 102 million doses in Q1 of this year.

Sales to the US government were $1.2 billion in the third quarter, reflecting 73 million doses delivered, compared to $2.1 billion and 126 million doses in Q2 and sales of $1.4 billion and 88 million doses in Q1.

 

Sales to the rest of the world were $3.6 billion in the third quarter, reflecting 136 million doses delivered, compared to sales of $2.1 billion and 73 million doses in Q2 and $0.4 billion of sales and 14 million doses in Q1.

This reflects the significant manufacturing ramp up outside the US over the last two quarters.

 

The relatively modest increase of delivered doses in Q3 versus Q2 was driven by the factors that Stéphane just explained.

We continue to scale our production network and are working to achieve an increased quarter-over-quarter improvement starting in Q4.

 

Turning to slide 12.

The transformation of Moderna from an R&D-focused biotech to a commercial company continues to be very apparent when reviewing our financial results.

 

The comparison of the third quarter of 2021 to prior year is not meaningful due to our significant growth, which is why we will primarily focus on the quarter-over-quarter comparison relative to Q2 on the slide.

Total revenue was $5 billion in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $4.4 billion in the second quarter and $0.2 billion in the prior-year period.

 

The increase of total revenue is driven by the sale of the company's COVID-19 vaccine.

Product sales in Q3 were $4.8 billion compared to $4.2 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 15%.

 

Cost of sales was $722 million or 15% of the company's product sales in the third quarter compared to $750 million or 18% of product sales in the second quarter.

The quarter-over-quarter percentage improvement is driven by higher average selling price as a result of shifts in our customer mix and, to a smaller extent, by favorable manufacturing costs.

 

Research and development expenses were $521 million in the third quarter, up from 421 million in Q2 and $344 million in the same period in 2020.

The higher spend versus prior quarter and prior year was driven by increased COVID-19 vaccine clinical development activities, including our announced efforts around booster variant-specific and multivalent vaccine candidates.

 

Headcount increases as well as external costs to support our growing and maturing development pipeline beyond the COVID-19 vaccine activities also contributed to the expense increase.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $168 million for Q3 compared to $121 million in the prior quarter and $48 million for the same period in the prior year.

 

The growth in spending was driven by the commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine globally with continued investments in personnel and outside services in support of the accelerated company build-out.

Provision for income taxes was $219 million in the third quarter, following $283 million in Q2 and an insignificant amount in the prior year.

 

Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 6%.

Let me remind you of the fact that we had a net operating loss carryforward of $2.3 billion at the end of 2020.

 

This year, we started to release the valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets, which results in an estimated non-recurring full-year benefit to our effective tax rates of about 5 percentage points.

Our Q3 effective tax rate was lower than the US statutory rate, primarily due to the just-described benefit related to the release of the valuation allowance, the foreign derived intangible income deduction and an excess tax deduction related to stock-based compensation.

 

This last item drove the quarter-over-quarter reduction due to the increase in our share price in Q3 versus Q2.

We recorded net income of $3.3 billion in Q3 compared to $2.8 billion in Q2, an increase of 20%.

 

This compares to a loss of $0.2 billion in Q3 of last year.

Diluted earnings per share for Q3 2021 were $7.70.

 

Turning now to year-to-date financial results compared to prior year on slide 13.

Total revenue was $11.3 billion for the first nine months of this year compared to $0.2 billion for the same period in 2020.

 

The significant growth was driven by the sales of 510 million doses of the company's COVID-19 vaccine.

Grant revenue of $473 million in the first nine months of 2021, an increase of $286 million compared to the prior year, was primarily driven by increases in revenue from BARDA related to the company's COVID-19 vaccine development.

 

Cost of sales was $1.7 billion or 16% of the company's product sales for the year-to-date period as of September 30, including third-party royalties of $400 million.

A portion of the inventory costs associated with this year's product sales was expensed as prelaunch inventory costs in 2020.

 

If inventories sold for the first nine months of this year was valued at cost, our cost of sales for the period would have been 17% of the product sales.

Research and development expenses were $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30 of this year compared to $0.6 billion for the same period in 2020.

 

The growth in spending in 2021 was mainly due to increase in clinical trial expenses and, to a lesser extent, personnel-related costs, manufacturing expenses, and consulting and outside services, primarily driven by increased mRNA-1273 clinical development activities.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $0.4 billion for the first nine months of this year compared to $0.1 billion for the same period in 2020.

 

The growth in spending in 2021 was mainly due to increases in consulting and outside services, personnel-related costs, and marketing expenses primarily attributable to the company's COVID-19 vaccine commercialization-related activities and increased headcount.

For the nine months ended September 30, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $541 million compared to insignificant amounts in the same period in 2020.

 

Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of this year was 7%.

It was lower than the US statutory rate primarily due to non-recurring benefits related to the release of the valuation allowance, the ongoing benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, as well as a discrete item for excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation.

 

Net income was $7.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30 of this year compared to a net loss of $0.5 billion for the same period in 2020.

Diluted earnings per share were $17 for the first nine months of 2021.

 

Turning to cash and selected cash flow information on slide 14.

We ended Q3 2021 with cash and investments of $15.3 billion compared to $12.2 billion at the end of Q2.

 

The increase is driven by our commercial sales and additional customer deposits received in the third quarter for future purchases of our COVID-19 vaccine.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 billion in Q3 after $4.1 billion in Q2.

 

The quarter-over-quarter reduction is driven by a lower amount of cash deposits for future product supply received in Q3 compared to Q2.

On a year-to-date basis, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.3 billion compared to $0.8 billion in the prior year.

 

Cash used for purchases of property and equipment was $164 million for the nine months ended September 30 compared to $44 million for the same period in 2020, reflecting continuous investments in our manufacturing infrastructure.

Now turning to slide 15.

 

Let me briefly expand further on our cash and investment position and the net balance of cash deposits for future product supply as this is an important point when modeling future cash flows.

The cash and investment balance reported as of September 30 was $15.3 billion, up from $12.2 billion as of June 30.

 

The increase is driven by our commercial activities, including cash receipts from product sales and customer deposits for future product supply.

The net balance of cash deposits for future product supply was $6.7 billion at the end of Q3, at a similar level to the balance in Q2 of this year.

 

Turning now to the 2021 updated financial framework on slide 16.

For the full-year 2021, we expect a product sales range of $15 billion to 18 billion.

 

We now expect to be able to deliver 700 million to 800 million doses at the 100 microgram dose level to our customers.

This compares to the prior outlook of 800 million to 1 billion doses.

 

Our total cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, third-party royalties as well as logistics and warehousing costs.

Given the favorability we have observed in the year-to-date period, we now expect total cost of sales as a percent of product sales between 16% to 17% for the full year 2021.

 

This compares to our previous outlook of 18% to 20% of product sales.

For 2022, we currently expect the cost of sales ratio to exceed 20%, driven by customer mix and multiple presentation types.

 

On the R&D and SG&A expense side, we continue to plan for an increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis and expect this trend to continue for the remainder of 2021 and beyond, driven by a maturing development portfolio and the scale-up of our commercial activities.

Based on further increased visibility of the utilization of our accumulated net operating loss carryforward, expected global sales mix and the mentioned discrete benefits in the first nine months of this year, we now expect our all-in 2021 tax rate to be in the high single-digit range.

 

This compares to our previous forecast of approximately 10%.

Since we won't have a material benefit from our valuation allowance in future years, we expect our reported 2022 effective tax rate will increase relative to our 2021 rate.

 

It's also too early to further comment on impacts from a potential tax reform.

Finally, regarding capital investments.

 

We are now planning for approximately $0.4 billion of capital investment to fall into the 2021 calendar year compared to our previous range of $450 million to $550 million.

We are strongly committed to a further build-out of our manufacturing and general company infrastructure, and hence predict capital investment in 2022 will be meaningfully above 2021 levels.

 

This concludes my remarks concerning the financial performance.

And I now turn the call over to Paul Burton.

 



Paul Burton

Thank you, David.

 

And good morning, good afternoon, everyone.

With more than 150 million people worldwide now having received two doses of our vaccine, we are humbled to be able to see the positive impact it is having on people's lives around the world.

 

We are reminded of the fact that almost 250 million people have been infected with COVID-19 globally and 5 million people have lost their lives.

Our profound thanks, as always, go out to those on the front lines, working tirelessly to keep us safe in this ongoing fight.

 

Through numerous independent studies, time and time again, we see consistent findings showing that mRNA-1273 is highly effective in saving lives, reducing hospitalizations and reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection.

I will highlight a few of these independently conducted studies this morning.

 

In slide 18, I will begin with some of the data from the United States government.

These data come from the CDC and show through September of this year the difference in COVID-19 cases between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.

 

An unvaccinated person has an 11-fold greater risk of dying from COVID-19, underscoring the importance of getting vaccinated plays in our protection and ending this pandemic.

The data show that vaccination with mRNA-1273 provides the greatest protection, not only against COVID-19 infection, but also death due to COVID-19.

 

In fact, even during the surge of the Delta virus variant during the summer months this year, Moderna's vaccine had the lowest reported deaths associated with breakthrough infection as the CDC data demonstrate.

Approximately 160 million doses of the Moderna vaccine have been administered in the United States.

 

And in the next slide, I want to show you some further government-generated data in a country where the Moderna vaccine has also had extensive use, and that country is Switzerland.

You can see here exposure data on the left.

 

Approximately 3.6 million people have been fully vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine and 1.9 million people have been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer/BionTech vaccine.

These government-generated data from the Federal Office of Public Health in Switzerland, again, are clear and show that vaccination with the Moderna vaccine is highly effective at reducing infections, hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 infection.

 

For every 1 million people vaccinated, use of mRNA-1273 would be expected to result in 643 fewer COVID-19 breakthrough infections, 78 hospitalizations and 38 fewer deaths.

Next, in slide 20, our data from two other recent independent studies that build on the results I just showed you from Switzerland.

 

The first study on the left side of this slide followed 38 million vaccinated people in the United States, Iceland and South Korea.

And again, found that those people vaccinated with mRNA-1273 were at 53% reduced risk of a COVID-19 infection and 33% reduced risk of a COVID-19 hospitalization compared to those vaccinated with the alternate mRNA vaccine.

 

The data on the right hand of the slide are from a recent publication by Nordstrom and colleagues in Sweden and Norway, showing that mRNA-1273 delivered 87% vaccine effectiveness during a time of high Delta variant circulation in those countries.

The data I've shared so far are all from the general population.

 

Let me turn now to the effectiveness of the Moderna vaccine, in particularly vulnerable populations, the immunocompromised.

These data were published just two days ago, again, by the United States CDC VISION network and examine vaccine effectiveness at preventing COVID-19 hospitalization, which is so critically important in individuals with a variety of immunocompromised medical conditions between January and September of this year.

 

As the authors of this study note, with the exception of those individuals with rheumatic disorders, vaccine effectiveness point estimates were generally higher for the Moderna vaccine than for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

And the difference in effectiveness in these hard-to-immunize populations is shown in the column on the right.

 

I want to turn now to the topic of myocarditis and to put it in the context of the clinical benefits of vaccination that I've just described with mRNA-1273.

It is important to recognize that the cases of myocarditis reported to occur following mRNA vaccination are rare, generally mild, typically respond to conservative treatment and self-limiting.

 

Health authorities have reviewed many data sets and the US CDC and WHO have concluded that there is a risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after receiving any mRNA vaccine.

The WHO's Advisory Committee on vaccine safety notes that myocarditis can occur following SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 disease and that mRNA vaccines have a clear benefit in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19.

 

Analyses from our global safety database show that the events of myocarditis are very rare.

Overall, we observe 9.5 cases of myocarditis per million vaccinated individuals compared to an expected rate of 21 cases per million individuals.

 

Now, in common with other reports of mRNA vaccines in individuals aged 18 to 24, we see an increased rate of myocarditis of 40 cases versus 17 expected cases per million individuals.

These data from our own safety database are consistent with the findings from safety databases evaluated by the CDC and other global health authorities.

 

And the link to the CDC analysis is provided on the slide below.

MRNA-1273 has been authorized for use in adolescents aged 12 to 18 in multiple countries around the world.

 

Moderna's global safety database has information on an estimated 1.5 million of them, providing us an opportunity to look at the rate of myocarditis in those individuals, and those data are shown in this table.

We see the small, absolute, well-described risk of increased myocarditis rates in males aged 18 to 24 that I just described to you.

 

But we do not see an increased risk in adolescents, neither in boys nor in girls.

These data are reassuring and important as we continue to offer mRNA-1273 to adults, adolescents and as we file for authorization in children.

 

So, in summary, the data I've shared with you today from independent government reports in the United States and in Switzerland, countries with high vaccination rates of Moderna's vaccine, show that mRNA-1273 is associated with lowest breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19.

Other independent studies in millions of individuals continue to show that mRNA-1273 is highly effective in reducing the risk of breakthrough COVID-19 as well as hospitalizations and death.

 

And importantly, this is also true in those vulnerable and hard-to-vaccinate immunocompromised patient populations.

Moderna's global safety database of 151 million vaccinated individuals shows a rate of myocarditis in males aged 18 to 24 that is consistent with analyses by CDC and others.

 

Moderna's global safety database does not show an increased risk of myocarditis in 1.5 million individuals below the age of 18 and vaccinated with Spikevax.

So, this concludes my quick overview of some recent analyses of mRNA-1273 effectiveness data and review of data from our global safety database.

 

And I will now turn the call over to Stephen.



Stephen Hoge

Thank you, Paul.

 

And good morning or good afternoon, everyone.

Today, I'll review the progress we've made across our vaccines and therapeutics pipeline.

 

Let me start with our COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, for adult ages 18 and above where there are a number of important regulatory updates.

First, we have announced that the FDA granted priority review to Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine BLA.

 

In October, we also received an EUA from the FDA and the European Commission's approval for a booster dose of our COVID-19 vaccine at the 50-microgram dose level for the adult cohort ages 18 and above.

Turning to the adolescents and pediatric settings.

 

As a reminder, there are two clinical trials for each of these groups: TeenCOVE is our study in the adolescent population, 12 to 17 year olds, and KidCOVE is the study in the pediatric population, age 11 and younger.

For the adolescent population, 12 to 17 years old, our vaccine is authorized in a number of countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, the European Union, Canada, Switzerland, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and Argentina, to name a few.

 

We've submitted data from our Kid/TeenCOVE study to the FDA in the United States as well as to other countries.

We were recently notified by the FDA that the agency will require additional time to evaluate our proposed amendment due to recent analysis of the risk of myocarditis after vaccination in some populations.

 

The agency expects this evaluation may extend until January 2022.

As Paul noted, Moderna's global safety database includes an estimated 1.5 million adolescents, who've received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, most outside of the United States.

 

And to date, we have not observed a rate of myocarditis from those younger than 18 years in our safety database that points to an increased risk of myocarditis in that population.

We continue to believe the benefits of vaccination significantly outweigh the risks.

 

In the pediatric setting, our study known as KidCOVE is ongoing and is focused in three age groups, a group with children 6 to 11 years of age, a group of 2 to less than 6, and a group of children 6 months to less than 2.

The trial consists of a dose escalation phase for each group, followed by an expansion phase once the dose has been selected.

 

Last week, we shared positive top line data from the oldest of the age groups in KidCOVE, the 6 to 11-year-old cohort, showing the two 50-microgram doses of mRNA-1273 were generally well tolerated and that the primary immunogenicity endpoints were met.

We will submit our results soon to the EMA and other global regulatory agencies.

 

For the other two age groups in KidCOVE, the 2 to less than 6 years old group and the 6-month to less than 2-year old group, our dose selection studies are ongoing.

On the next slide, let me share with you some of the data we have in children ages 6 to less than 12 years of age.

 

This data is after dose one as we are waiting for additional follow-up time to share the post-dose two data.

As a reminder, the study was randomized two to one for vaccine versus placebo.

 

Based on the case definition of COVID-19 that we used in the Phase III adult study, the observed interim vaccine efficacy was 100% in this analysis, starting two weeks after the first dose and using that case definition.

Vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection was also high at 80% and vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was 65%.

 

Both endpoints that we think are incredibly important as we seek to end the pandemic.

Turning now to our booster and next-generation COVID-19 vaccine programs on slide 28.

 

As a reminder, we are evaluating multiple COVID-19 vaccines as potential boosters to provide the broadest range of countermeasures to the virus as it continues to evolve.

We were granted EUA for the 50-microgram dose of our current vaccine as a booster, as mentioned previously.

 

And we are currently evaluating two variant-specific vaccines and two multivalent vaccine candidates, which are combinations of different variants of concern in an effort to stay ahead of the evolving virus.

In addition, we're also evaluating mRNA-1283 as a next-generation refrigerator-stable vaccine, which is in a Phase I study.

 

The interim analysis of that Phase I data has been completed at three different dose levels and indicates that a lower dose of mRNA-1283 can achieve similar neutralizing antibody responses in primary series as our authorized vaccine mRNA-1273.

mRNA-1283 also had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and we're moving forward toward a Phase II booster study for that candidate.

 

This will also evaluate even lower doses of mRNA-1283, given the strong boosting performance seen in Phase I.

While the start of our booster strategy in late January of this year was in response to the threat of newly identified variants at that time, our booster strategy has continued to evolve as the pandemic unfolds.

 

Slide 29 is a slide we shared at our Vaccines Day in April of this year.

At the time, the graph on the left was illustrative of our view of the likely path for the pandemic based on our perspective on respiratory virus evolution and epidemiology, including prior coronavirus pandemics.

 

Today, it's becoming clear that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is following the footsteps of other respiratory viruses and is on its way to becoming a seasonal epidemic/endemic threat.

So.

 

where are we now?

With Delta and the potential for other variants, the winter of 2021, 2022 still looks to be a time of moderating, but persistent, variant epidemic waves.

 

Infection and reinfection continue to cause morbidity and mortality during this phase, but hopefully in fewer people.

The focus will remain on suppressing the rate of viral evolution and emergence.

 

Primary vaccination is critical.

But given the high rate of background transmission, booster vaccines will also be important in all countries.

 

Looking ahead, we expect 2022 will be the beginning of the seasonal endemic phase, reinfections in individuals who are at high risk, including older adults, the immunocompromised or healthy adults with more rapidly waning immunity due to under vaccination with potentially less effective vaccines will be at the greatest risk for severe outcomes.

As with the recent Delta wave, this will include some risk of hospitalization and, unfortunately, some risk of death as well as social disruption.

 

We believe this will become the primary population for whom seasonal boosting will provide a significant and enduring benefit.

In summary, as we described earlier this year, we believe SARS-CoV-2 is following a familiar path that will ultimately become a seasonal threat to a large population of higher risk adults.

 

Perhaps the biggest unknown in the near term is the extent to which further viral evolution in the coming Northern Hemisphere winter and Southern Hemisphere winter in 2022 will create fertile ground for newly transmissible and immune-evading variants to emerge.

If so, rapid boosting may become necessary.

 

We will need to remain vigilant throughout this time as we fight the pandemic, and we are ready to advance updated boosters rapidly if they become needed.

Now moving from COVID on to slide 30.

 

We announced in September that the Phase I portion of our quadrivalent seasonal flu vaccine, mRNA-1010, is fully enrolled and we look forward to sharing data from that trial and moving to Phase II soon.

We also announced positive Phase I interim data from our RSV vaccine in older adults in September, and we plan to start pivotal Phase II/III RSV vaccine trial before the end of 2021.

 

Separately, the pediatric RSV program continues to move forward with cohorts enrolling well in our Phase I study.

Our hMPV/PIV3 study in pediatrics is also currently enrolling in toddlers.

 

We were very excited to announce last week that our Phase III CMV vaccine trial has dosed its first participants.

The start of the Phase III trial, CMVictory is an important step in evaluating our CMV vaccine against congenital CMV.

 

As a reminder, CMV is the number one cause of birth defects in the United States, and we are evaluating the safety and efficacy of mRNA-1647 in women ages 16 to 40 at the 100-microgram dose level.

The trial is starting in the US and will include approximately 150 sites globally, and will enroll on approximately 6,900 women of child-bearing age.

 

Importantly, including criteria of the trial includes women at high risk of CMV exposure through direct exposure in the home, socially or occupationally to children under five years of age.

Diversity in our clinical trials is also extremely important to us, and we're proud to continue our commitment from last year on clinical trial diversity.

 

We believe setting targets and measuring ourselves against them remains one of the most important ways we can work to address the healthcare inequity in clinical research.

For the CMVictory Phase III study, our goal is to have 42% of the trial participants in the United States come from communities of color, many of which are disproportionately impacted by the CMV virus.

 

Moving on from vaccines.

This slide highlights our mRNA therapeutics pipeline.

 

At R&D Day, we described how our modalities and therapeutic areas overlap.

In oncology, our PCV Phase II trial is now fully enrolled and we expect to readout for that as early as the fourth quarter of next year.

 

Separately, an expansion cohort in head and neck cancer in our Phase I trial is ongoing.

We also have Phase I trials ongoing for our KRAS vaccine, which is partnered with Merck, the triplet program, and the IL-12 intratumoral program, which is partnered with AstraZeneca.

 

In cardiovascular, our VEGF program, also partnered with AstraZeneca, has completed the enrollment of a low-dose cohort in its Phase II study and AZ will be providing updates at a presentation of the data at the American Heart Association meeting in two weeks.

Within autoimmune, our IL-2 program is in a Phase I trial in dosing.

 

And within rare diseases, our PA and MMA trials are ongoing in Phase I and our GSD1a program has an open IND and is expected to start a Phase I study soon.

I'm also very excited to announce that our first cystic fibrosis program has moved into preclinical development with IND-enabling studies now underway.

 

We and our partners at Vertex are pleased to announce that development candidate, VXc-522.

This program marks our first program in a brand-new modality, inhaled therapeutics.

 

As a reminder, our Moderna modality encompasses a new method for utilizing our proprietary lipid nanoparticle technologies and mRNA technologies to bring forward medicines.

Now double-clicking for a moment on the CF programs in research, recall that we have two partnerships with Vertex.

 

Our first collaboration targets the CFTR protein and trying to produce it using mRNA and LNP technologies.

This is where we are advancing our candidate, VXc-522.

 

We also have a collaboration with Vertex using mRNA for gene editing and gene therapy.

Both collaborations are focused on treating this 10% of CF patients with disease that unfortunately is not addressable with current CFTR modulators.

 

For this 10% of the CF population, alternative approaches are absolutely necessary.

And the exciting update today, as I said a moment ago, is that we're announcing the first development candidate to move into development from that collaboration described on the left-hand side of this slide.

 

In this collaboration, we're delivering messenger RNA that encodes for CFTR protein that is missing or non-functional in patients who suffer from cystic fibrosis.

We plan to target that 10% that I mentioned a moment ago.

 

We've been working incredibly hard with Vertex to advance the candidate, and we are very excited that that has now moved into IND-enabling studies.

As Vertex announced recently, they expect to submit an IND in 2022, paving the path for clinical studies in these patients.

 

In the close, I'd like to just highlight our pipeline on the following three slides, starting on slide 35, which includes our respiratory vaccines in development.

Slide 36 summarizes our large portfolio of latent virus vaccines and vaccines against other viruses.

 

And on slide 37, you will see the extensive mRNA therapeutics pipeline that we have in development.

With that, I'll hand it back to Stéphane to close.

 



Stéphane Bancel

Thank you, Stephen.

 

Slide 39 is from our September 9 R&D Day and summarizes the product franchise we focus on at Moderna.

Priority number 1 is our pan-respiratory annual booster franchise.

 

Priority number 2 is our first in-class vaccines for latent viruses.

Priority number 3 is our therapeutics based on mRNA-encoded proteins.

 

And priority number 4 is the therapeutic space on mRNA-encoded gene editing enzymes.

As we have said for several quarters now, SARS-CoV-2 is here to stay and will evolve from a pandemic to endemic setting.

 

We believe that 2022 will see pandemic in low-income countries throughout the year, but at high income countries, the year would be of two halves, pandemic priming for children and boosting for others with an endemic boosting campaign in the fall of 2022.

On slide 42, you can see the revenue drivers that we anticipate will play out in 2022.

 

We believe there are three components that will drive our COVID-19 vaccine revenues for next year.

First, signed APAs.

 

We have already signed around $17 billion of advanced purchase agreements, or APAs, for delivery in 2022.

Second, APA options.

 

There are up to $3 billion of APAs that are in options.

Some options have been converted in Q3 from options to firm order.

 

Third, the fall of 2022 commercial market.

We also believe that the fall of 2022, assuming that BLA is granted for boosters, will drive the commercial booster market of up to $2 billion.

 

So, in total, at this point, we believe that 2022 revenues could be between $17 billion and $22 billion.

We, of course, continue to have discussions [indiscernible] APAs with governments and international organizations, including COVAX, the Pan American Health Organization or PAHO, and the African Union.

 

For this pan-respiratory franchise, our goal is to evolve the COVID-19 vaccine primary series into fall of 2021 boosters, which is happening as we speak, and then fall of 2022 boosters and then add to a COVID booster a flu booster in a single dose, and then added to COVID and flu an allergy booster in a single dose.

Our flu vaccine human data should be out soon.

 

And the team is already preparing the Phase II/III for flu.

And RSV is moving fast to Phase II/III.

 

If we you look at the health damage of latent viruses, it is profound.

EBV is a major cause of infectious mononucleosis.

 

EBV has been reported to increase risk of multiple sclerosis.

EBV is associated with certain cancers and autoimmune diseases and EBV is associated with a higher risk of long COVID.

 

CMV associated will be the leading cause of birth defects.

CMV is a major driver of immune dysfunctions with aging.

 

CMV is associated with cardiovascular diseases.

CMV is associated with cancer and cognitive impairments.

 

For now, our focus is CMV, EBV and HIV, but we are developing in the labs vaccine against other latent viruses [indiscernible] human health.

Our goal is to eliminate these viruses.

 

As we discussed earlier, several cancer and rare genetic programs are in the clinic and will provide clinical results soon.

On November 15, AZ will present Phase II data in patients from the VEGF program at the American Health Association.

 

And we are pleased to announce the new modality with inhaled pulmonary therapeutics.

Moderna [Technical Difficulty] is our effort to expand the use of our platform to create more innovative drugs to help patients.

 

Our strategy to invest internally under the leadership of Dr.

Eric Huang with a dedicated team and to set up licenses agreements with next-generation in gene editing companies.

 

The Metagenomi partnership is a first step in that direction.

The strategic path of the company is very clear and exciting.

 

We want to stop people getting hospitalized from respiratory infection.

We won't stop until this goal is achieved.

 

We want to stop our fellow human beings from suffering from these latent viruses.

We want to bring to market mRNA encoded protein therapeutics in oncology, cardiology, rare genetic disease, autoimmune.

 

We want to bring therapeutics using gene-editing enzymes.

We believe Moderna could become the most impactful drug company in the world.

 

As we scale, we realize that we needed to go further in setting the right framework for our team to understand what has made Moderna.

So, we worked through Q2 and Q3 to articulate our mindset, how we behave, and make decisions at Moderna.

 

There is more information on our website and we'll be happy to spend time with those of you who want to learn more about them.

Let me just summarize them at a high level.

 

At Moderna, we act with urgency.

Action today compounds the life saved tomorrow.

 

We pursue options in parallel to make the best choice later.

We accept risk as the only path to impact.

 

We're obsessed over learning.

We don't have to be the smartest.

 

We have to run the fastest.

We pivot fearlessly in the pace of new data.

 

We question convention because proven models don't always fuel the future.

We push past possible.

 

We behave like owners.

The solutions we are building go beyond any job description.

 

We act with dynamic range, driving strategy and execution at the same time and at every step of the way.

We remove viscosity to encourage collective action.

 

We prioritize our platform over any single product.

We digitalize everything possible using the power of digital information to maximize our impact on patients.

 

We want to be the most impactful drug company in the world.

We care deeply about doing it the right way.

 

It means being a great company to work for, as exemplified by our seventh consecutive year ranked as the best company to work for by Science.

But it also means building a company that is responsible in minimizing our impact on the planet.

 

We are proud to have announced earlier this week that we will work to achieve net zero carbon emission for our operations globally by 2030.

I want to thank the Moderna team for their commitment to our mission, and their relentless work to build the best version of Moderna over the next 20 years.

 

Before we jump into Q&A, we wanted to share the dates of our annual investor event for 2022; Vaccine Day on March 24; Science Day on May 17; and R&D Day on September 8.

Operator, we'll now be happy to take any questions.

 
Operator

[Operator Instructions].

 

Our first question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs.



Salveen Richter

For 2022, can you walk through the supply aspects.

 

Are you still guiding to up to 3 billion doses here?

And can you also speak to demand dynamics?

 

Is there upside to the guidance that you've commented on today for future signed APAs.

And then secondly, how confident are you that you can fix these supply issues and over what time frame?

 



Stéphane Bancel

Let me take those different questions.

 

Let me start with the short term.

Yes, we really believe we can fix those short-term supply issues.

 

As I tried to explain in my remarks, those are what I would qualify as teething problems of scaling up so fast.

In Q1, it was all about making enough drug substance and we are literally now waiting to have enough drug substance to fill vials.

 

And as the teams scaled very nicely, in Q2, the challenge we had internally was all about filling vials.

And the complexity of Q3 has really moved to, I would say, the back end of the supply chain, which is releasing product and shipping products.

 

And the complexity has been around just a number of markets we have to serve.

Beginning of the year, it was mostly shipping to CDC in the US and Europe, and that was it.

 

But then as we increased the number of countries to many dozens by now, the complexity is just increasing and it's even further now that we are serving COVAX.

We need to go country by country.

 

So, that's just the type of teething problems that we are experiencing right now.

We have increased personnel.

 

We have invested in digital to help the teams.

So, I already expect this to be resolved like we resolved the drug substance challenges in Q1 and the drug product challenges in Q2.

 

In terms of drug substance, yes, we could see make up to 3 billion doses in terms of material.

As you know, that number was really depending on the booster dose.

 

And now that we're on the other side of that decision with 50-microgram dose, we confirm we could make up to 3 billion doses, if there was a need for it.

The challenge in 2022 is going to really be around product form because, as the market moves to an endemic market, you're going to need basically vials to be able to go to less number of dose per vial.

 

Again, in a pandemic setting, as you know, we launched with 10 dose per vial, which we think was really adapted.

In low-income countries, we even add more into vials now.

 

But as we think about the endemic market and we're trying to serve pandemic and endemic at the same time, we just need to keep adding presentation to be relevant to healthcare workers and to healthcare systems around the world.

So drug substance will not be an issue.

 

There's, of course, as I described, potential upside to those numbers.

We still have quite a number of APAs being discussed with countries around the world.

 

We don't know what will happen in terms of epidemiology.

Is there a new variant coming?

 

Is it a variant where the current vaccines is still helpful or we need, as Stephen described, a new booster.

There is, of course, a big question mark here that we're all following epidemiology literally on a daily basis.

 

And then, there's so many for boosting people around the world that have had non-mRNA vaccines.

As everybody knows, there is a problem of waning immunity over time.

 

So, time is not our friend as people see the level of antibody going down and as we have new variants like Delta or potentially others.

But we should not forget that most people around the planet have not had an mRNA vaccine injected in their body to date.

 

And so, we believe there is an important need to boost people with mRNA vaccines.

And as Paul showed the real world evidence including the data from CDC and Switzerland, the more we get data and the more time we have been to see, we see a net differentiation between products.

 

And this doesn't go unnoticed by governments around the world who are working really hard to preventing hospitalization and death.

And so, there is upside to that.

 

Again, it's a very unpredictable environment.

None of us has worked through a pandemic before thankfully.

 

But you will be assured that we will keep scaling up manufacturing, we'll keep in getting with government, so that we can maximize how we can help people and the revenue should follow from that.
Operator

Your next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.

 



Matthew Harrison

Two for me this morning.

 

So, first, can we just spend a moment on myocarditis.

And I think the overlying question here is, why do you think the regulator is more concerned with your vaccine in younger age groups compared to Pfizer, which has obviously already been approved in younger age groups.

 

And then related to that, how much of an impact is this having on uptake and distribution of your vaccine given that we see Pfizer continue to highlight potential differences and bringing that to government's attention?

And then secondly, on flu, can you just comment on how you're going to interpret these results?

 

Obviously, we're just going to get titer results.

But I think it's your premise that you can achieve a much higher efficacy flu vaccine compared to traditional flu vaccines.

 

So do you think there is a clear correlation in titers to efficacy?

And what level of titers would demonstrate very high efficacy?

 



Stephen Hoge

This is Stephen.

 

I'll try and take those questions.

So, first, look, I think it's most important to say that what we communicated and desired to be maximally transparent last week was that the FDA, unlike other regulators, has asked for some more time to review emerging recent data.

 

And that might take until January.

I think your question is how is that different vis-à-vis what happened with the Pfizer vaccine.

 

I think the most important thing to recognize is that the Pfizer adolescent vaccine was authorized prior to any substantial discussion about myocarditis as a benefit or as a risk.

In fact, the signal emerged a few weeks later just before we made our filing.

 

And I think a prudent approach there was to – there was a VRBPAC conducted, there was ongoing discussions.

But what we've continued to see over the last four or five months is that for both mRNA vaccines, there's a question of whether there's an increased rate of myocarditis above background in 18 to 24-year-old males, a relatively small population, but an important one.

 

And I think it's in the face of those continuing emerging questions that the FDA has been diligent and appropriately conservative in their approach and making sure they have the time to review those.

And they have continued to come out over time.

 

And so, I think, principally, what we're seeing here as the difference is a function of timing, which is that the other vaccine had been authorized prior to this concern and there has been continued emerging data around that.

We are very grateful to the FDA for that diligence.

 

I would note that the same information are available to other regulators.

And as I have said before, we are authorized for that population internationally.

 

And fortunately, as Paul characterized, we have not seen an increased rate of myocarditis in 12 to 17-year-olds.

And we think, over time, the substantial benefits of our vaccine will ultimately win out here.

 

And so, we look forward to continuing to work with the FDA.

So, that's my best version of what I think we heard from them last week.

 

The question about how we see that evolving over time.

Obviously, internationally, we are participating in the market.

 

In the United States, adolescent vaccinations have substantially tailed off, as we all would note.

And so, the extent that there is an ongoing need in the United States for vaccination, it is a diminishing market for sure.

 

And again, this is a primary series vaccine.

And so, we do hope that most people in the world will seroconvert and not need a primary series moving forward.

 

The question then of what is that endemic market going forward that is of greatest import.

And I've tried to summarize that in our view of the evolution of this virus and what that need will be.

 

It is, we believe, in the future, a booster market.

And the booster market, targeted at those populations that are at higher risk of respiratory disease.

 

Those populations tend to be older adults and immunecompromised.

Places where we think mRNA-1273 is demonstrating really remarkable efficacy, differentiated perhaps.

 

But publicly reported data is really encouraging on that dimension.

And I would note that is not a population that's associated to date with any of the vaccines that have an increased rate of myocarditis.

 

And so, the benefit risk there, we think, even swings more favorably to 1273, but we'll allow data to continue to develop and ultimately drive this behavior.

So we are quite encouraged by the performance of the vaccine in a population that we think is going to be most important in the years ahead.

 

The last question was on flu, which is what do we think about that data.

Obviously, as you pointed to, there are correlates of protection that have been used previously with HAI titers in influenza vaccine.

 

We will be looking at that, as I'm sure everybody will, as well as other responses in the immune system as we continue to try and identify the optimal dose.

I'm not going to put out there a view of what I think our view of success will look like.

 

I would just say that we have very high expectations for our platform.

Now we do believe that our performance in older adults, including with the COVID vaccine, but also more recently with the RSV booster study in Phase I demonstrates that our platform does incredibly well in those at highest risk of these respiratory viral diseases.

 

And so, we're optimistic that we will continue to show strong performance, hopefully strongest performance in those populations.

But I won't give you a specific titer number today.

 



Stéphane Bancel

Maybe just to add to Stephen's point, Matthew, I think we should not forget the company's strategy, which is on combination.

 

We believe that combining flu and COVID boosters in a single dose and then adding allergy is the critical central part of our strategy.

We think it has tremendous value for compliance, for protection.

 

It has a tremendous value in terms of convenience to the consumers.

I do not believe that most people will want the flu shot and a COVID shot and an allergy shot every fall.

 

And as we heard from the payer and healthcare workers, that's the value of our product.

So we believe the combination is really a critical success factor.

 
Operator

Next question is from Ted Tenthoff with Piper Sandler.

 



Edward Tenthoff

My question has to do with the emerging orphan disease pipeline.

 

And I've been really impressed by the progress that you guys are making there in these important patients.

And I think the mRNA technology just suits ideally here.

 

So, what do you see as sort of the plans over the next couple of years.

Kind of take us forward a little bit.

 

What could this pipeline look like?

And maybe you can just give us a sense of where you think Moderna will be in the orphan disease setting in a couple of years.

 



Stephen Hoge

I'll take that too.

 

So, first, I think we're very excited about the programs that are already in the clinical space, either already dosing patients or about to start.

And so, I think the most important thing is looking forward to next year, the demonstration, we would hope, of proof of concept in that rare disease modality.

 

As you know, we are dosing quite a large number of folks in propionic acidemia and we've been dosing in methylmalonic acidemia.

With the opening of the GSD1a IND, we'd hope to be following a short order there.

 

So, all three of those are potentials for us to demonstrate the real proof that this technology can be used to correct inborne errors of metabolism in these populations.

I'll also note that there's a quite a wide range of disease going down to as young as two years of age in some of the organic acidemias and also the older adults in some of the GSD1a program.

 

So, we're going to be demonstrating quite a lot there.

Crigler Najjar presents another opportunity for that proof-of-concept as well as the PKU program when that moves forward, but those are still in preclinical, as I said.

 

So the question is what do we do on the back of that proof-of-concept from any one or all of those programs.

What you've seen us do in respiratory vaccines and in vaccines generally is probably the best predictor of how we will respond, which is, as you know, there are a very, very large number of metabolic diseases that could be addressed to deliver through mRNA therapy.

 

We could list off large groups, the urea cycle of disorders, other organic acidemias, so many beyond that.

And even in moving into more broadly present metabolic diseases.

 

So, what we would do is we would define that systemic intracellular therapeutic modality as a core modality, just like we did with vaccines a couple of years ago.

And that would cause us to dramatically expand that pipeline.

 

Now I can assure you we're looking at those programs in research right now, but we have held back on moving them into preclinical development and putting them on our pipeline until we've seen the modalities perform.

So that is probably the most important thing for me, looking at the rare and orphan disease space over the course of the coming year, is when do we cross that threshold and then, ultimately, when do we expand dramatically that pipeline of programs.

 



Edward Tenthoff

I really appreciate seeing the new pulmonary disease areas.

 
Operator

We have a question from Michael Yee from Jefferies.

 



Michael Yee

Two questions.

 

One is just trying to clarify guidance.

I think there's some confusion around guidance.

 

So I would love to understand some clarification.

You lowered 2021 a little bit, I think, by $5 billion, but raised 2022 by $5 billion.

 

Is that a timing shift of deliveries?

And how much of that is just option contracts as you think about 2022 because you've talked about APAs as firm commitments.

 

I'm just trying to understand how much are commitments versus acceptances and how to think about those two.

And then on flu.

 

Following up on the flu question, I think people are looking at labels and looking at fold increases and seroconversion rates of four to seven times and 50 to 60% seroconversion rates.

Are those accurate numbers?

 

Are those numbers we should be looking at and comparing to?

Maybe you could just help us qualify that because I think that's what people are trying to do.

 



Stéphane Bancel

I'll take the first one and give it through to Stephen.

 

So, I think you already highlighted some of the other drivers.

So on 2021, so there's two things I think that is driving.

 

First is, of course, the lower volume.

And the second one is price.

 

As you know, we are working very hard with several governments to send products that they have bought for high-income countries like the US to low-income countries this side of Christmas.

And so, when you think about just the US, the US we see that publicly.

 

When we announced our African Union partnership, the US decided to delay to Q2 the delivery of the December quarter.

That volume is going to African Union at a low tier price.

 

So, you have an impact on the turnover just by doing the math of a lower price on the same volume right there.

And some orders that are moving from December to January on the supply volume side of things.

 

So, when you're on to 2022 where you have the increase of volume moved from December to January, that is one.

We've signed new APAs since the last numbers.

 

And as I said, some options have been exercised.

One of them was a COVAX option that was exercised at the end of Q3.

 

That is now counted as a full APA because of the firm commitment and some prepayments and so on.

And so, those are the dynamics that are happening.

 

The team also is starting to spend a lot of time, the commercial team, on focusing on the fall of 2022 because we think that's going to be an important moment.

The mix and match, we think, is critical.

 

That is now allowed in most places.

In some countries, they've been just mix and match for a long time.

 

But the US market, of course, is important, is allowing mix and match.

And as Paul just shared, we believe that as time will go, the data will show that what we believe is that we have a longer duration efficacy vaccine on the market.

 

And today, if you look at data and market research, very few consumer in the US know that.

People that are listening to this call know that because you read papers on a daily basis, a few people in the US.

 

We believe there is an opportunity for us between now and, let's say, next summer to make sure that people understand the facts, understand the real-world evidence, so that they can make an informed decision and that includes the healthcare workers, the pharmacies, the doctors, the nurses, that include the consumers directly.

And so, this is why, as we're starting to sharpen our pencils, everybody is spending a lot of time working toward the fall of 2022, we believe that's another piece that was not – if you go back to our previous numbers, we only disclosed APAs and options of APAs, the commercial opportunities for fall of 2022, we think, is going to be an important vector to the 2022 sales.

 

Stephen, on flu?



Stephen Hoge

I'll try and clarify that answer on seroconversion rates.

 

It is a Phase I study.

And so we are looking at a range of doses and I have not got access to the data.

 

So, I don't want to presuppose the specific answer yet.

As soon as we have the data, we will provide our thorough interpretation of it.

 

However, as you point out, generally seroconversion is defined as a fourfold rise in titers above baseline, and we've done that in some of our other studies.

And we will be looking at that from the percentage of people who've achieved that seroconversion.

 

And most important to me, we'll be looking at consistency of that percentage across ages.

In particular, the older adults where you often don't achieve the type of the same level of immunogenicity, but we believe with our platform will.

 

There are other endpoints as well in terms of seroprotection defined as absolute titers, again greater than 40 is accepted.

We will look how high that goes because that can also be reassuring.

 

But I don't think right now we're ready to guide on a specific target that we will declare success other than looking again at that fourfold rise for measuring seroconversion across the range of agents that we'll be studying in the study.

Next question is from Gena Wang from Barclays.

 

Your line is open.



Gena Wang

I have two regarding the COVID vaccine.

 

And the first question is, given the supply restraints, do you see 100-microgram doses being used as 250-microgram doses.

And then also, any hesitance due to safety concerns?

 

We did see a few countries put a cautionary action on Moderna vaccine.

And my second question is, in the US, if we do the math, you completed delivery of 300 million doses and then US exercised total doses of 410 million for 2021 and the 90 million doses in first quarter 2022.

 

So, just wondering how much of the remaining 110 million doses in 4Q 2021 will flow through next year.



Stephen Hoge

I can try and take the first question, although invite Paul as well.

 

So, I think in terms of -- you referenced some of the more recent communications that happened from public health officials, for instance, in the Nordics and elsewhere.

I would note that those same communications, literally often the same documents, include reference to the fact that there's very strong efficacy for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

 

And in fact, some of those Nordic country communications include reference to the fact that it looks to be potentially greater in terms of protection as emphasis for why the vaccine not only is still recommended in many of those jurisdictions, but ultimately provide very favorable benefit risk.

And so, we continue to believe that whole picture looking at the benefit and quantifying that benefit, which we think is substantial and larger than any risks contemplated here is really important.

 

And we, again, look to those communications that clearly state that.

Paul, anything you would add to that?

 



Paul Burton

Only, Stephen, that recently, I think last week, the WHO gave updated guidance continuing to endorse the vaccines in mRNA-1273.

 

And I think as they are doing their analysis of these data sets, have said that they need to think about potential biases that occur in general practice, looking at the primary vaccination schedule, the difference in timing.

We know the vaccines are used differently sometimes, and that may account for these.

 

But I think clear standing behind the data.



Stephen Hoge

Just as a closing comment, I would just reference, we have entered in some of these markets into a very interesting phase of the pandemic, which is that we are in the lower risk population and we are providing vaccination to them as appropriate.

 

So, as we do that, we're looking at benefit/risk in increasingly cautious ways, and that's appropriate.

But as we look forward to next year and we start thinking about boosting, and particularly, the seasonal market of protecting those that are highest risk, I think that calculus obviously changes pretty dramatically.

 

And so, I think we are in a period of time where we are, again, looking at the lowest risk populations.

And I think that is transient period time ultimately because it is high risk populations that are of greatest concern looking forward from 2022.

 



Stéphane Bancel

Maybe just to add just a bit of color.

 

I've had a chance to speak with a couple of health ministers across the world in the last week or two.

And I think people are very clear that the risk is low, that it's very manageable, as Paul said, and it's only in the male 18 to 24.

 

And those health ministers were clear about going back to the risk profile that Stephen just mentioned.

They care about having a winter where they don't have hospitals exploding again.

 

And this is driven by the 50 and above, the 40 and above where they know the vaccine, as Paul mentioned, with the data from the US or Switzerland or many other countries that 1273 vaccine seems to be a vaccine providing the longest protection of efficacy, and that's what they care about.

And so, I think that people are getting educated and looking at the data.

 

They're just trying to look at the facts and figure out, in a very practical way, how do they keep the economies running, how they keep people out of hospitals and are very focused on the high population.

As you know, in many countries, the boosters are not approved in the younger population, whereas they are being really advertised and promoted in the older population, so that people get boosted and don't get sick and hospitalized this winter.

 

On the US government, Gena, we don't comment on volume.

US government is a private contract to the government.

 

But indeed, there are some shift from Q4 to next year, both Q1 and Q2.

Next question is from Cory Kasimov with J.P.

 

Morgan.



Cory Kasimov

Two for me as well.

 

So, first of all, in terms of the 2022 APAs that you outlined, are the $17 billion worth of existing contracts constructed as firm commitments or do countries have – the contracts have optionality embedded in them wherein countries don't necessarily have to take the full amount depending on the evolution of the pandemic.

And then, my second question is, given your comments on the call about potentially moving into the endemic phase by the second half of next year, should we think about 2022 revenue as being weighted towards the first half of the year?

 



Stéphane Bancel

Thank you, Cory.

 

So let me take this apart.

The APAs do not have options.

 

When we say $17 billion of APAs, those are firm orders, signed orders and all our APAs have upfront payments.

David did a nice job walking you through the cash upfront we are receiving for those contracts.

 

It's one of the way that we are conducting our business.

We want people to be very committed and to have a material upfront of the total value of a deal when they sign.

 

The options components that we characterize as up to $3 billion as of today, those are true options, meaning people are reserving capacity.

And sometimes it's for financing rhythm because, again, as I said, we do not do APAs without upfront.

 

And one of the best example that's today public is COVAX.

We had to do a quarterly option with COVAX.

 

As I said, it just exercised that Q2 option at the end of Q3.

But Q3 2022 and Q4 2022 COVAX are still options and it's mostly because of a funding issue.

 

They don't have the cash.

They get cash from their different funders, which are mostly government and foundation, on the kind of a month-to-month basis.

 

And so, we did that to help COVAX and to do the right thing to help the planet.

As you know, we don't have to do options.

 

We say, if you want the vaccine when you sign a contract and you pay an upfront, but with COVAX we have to do so.

We thought it was the right thing to do.

 

And so, we expect, if they want their Q3 volume, that in Q1, they will exercise the options – sorry, end of Q4, they exercise the options [indiscernible].

On the endemic and [indiscernible] of the sales over the year, I think it will be dangerous to assume at this stage one way or another in terms of first half and second half because of volume and also pricing.

 

As you get the sense, the COVAX, the African Union and [indiscernible] deals we have lower prices and David mentioned that, tiered pricing.

And so, there might be a large volume, but the price might be way lower than what the commercial market could drive, which we believe is going to be above what has been the pandemic price again because of volume.

 

And so, we have people stocking ahead of when they need to inject in pharmacies.

I would be cautioned that assuming Q1 can be lower than Q2 is a bit too early.

 
Operator

Next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.

 



Geoff Meacham

I just had one more on the flu program, maybe for Stephen.

 

It's highly likely that you'll see an increase in antibody titers.

I was just thinking for the combo study, though, with 1273, what other factors do you need to address to de-risk that study?

 

And just, I guess, I'm trying to determine how to optimize the regimen by things like dose titration or even selecting the population by more urgent need for the COVID booster side of things.



Stephen Hoge

What we're going to be looking at in the combinations are actually the things that you just pointed to.

 

And so, in particular, we do believe the – most of the value of respiratory vaccination in the near term boosting will be in older adults, 50-plus or 60-plus depending upon how you want to look at it.

Very similar to the RSV population, certainly for the flu population and recommendations globally.

 

And we think COVID moves that direction as well.

And so, as we look to the first part of the question, where do we intend to optimize that ratio in immunogenicity, it really is towards those higher risk populations that do need, we think, a respiratory booster every year.

 

When it comes to looking at the – what are the combination of things that we're going to be doing in selecting that ratio in dose, obviously, it's mostly going to be immunogenicity and the tolerability profile.

Fortunately, these vaccines have been very safe to date in these older adult populations.

 

None of the concerns that we're having about myocarditis really exists in the 50 plus, 60 plus populations.

And so, we feel very confident on the overall safety profile.

 

But the question will be, where are we in optimizing the immunogenicity against endpoints that are pretty well validated now in COVID, and where are we against the immunogenicity against endpoints that are also broadly accepted in influenza.

We will be doing this for a range of different – it's a four-strain, seasonal strain vaccine.

 

And so, we'll want to make sure there's no interference between those and that we're able to achieve strong balance immunity across the four flu strains plus the COVID vaccine.

I think we have approximate targets based on the immunogenicity we saw from Phase III and the immunogenicity we're seeing in the booster studies.

 

But the open question is are we going to need all of that for the COVID portion of our vaccine going forward.

And so, we'll continue to follow over time whether we see more durable protection and, therefore, you might be able to optimize further that dose, if there was a reason to do so.

 

And then, the second part is with the seasonal annual flu component.

We just want to understand, particularly in the older adult population where flu vaccines have had less clear efficacy every season, is maybe the way I'll say it, and there is an opportunity for improvement by raising those titers.

 

We're going to want to look to whether or not we need to get those titers above what have been achieved by others.

And I'll note that there's a precedent even for high dose flu vaccines in that market that have been differentiated on price and grabbing market share.

 

And so, it could cause us to look in that 60-plus or 50-plus population at really indexing more to those flu antigens and making sure that we exceed or at least achieve that similar high degree of seroconversion there.

So, those are the factors that we'll look at around the 1073 program that we've announced.

 

We're looking at a range of ratios.

Fortunately, we're going to have experience.

 

We already have experience in flu and COVID from our prior work, and it will be a demonstration, we hope, of the ability to combine vaccines.

I will note, as a final comment, we have done combination respiratory vaccines in the past, including in adults with the 1653 program.

 

And so, we do have a basis, we're beginning to think, about how we might combine those antigens going forward.

But ultimately, we'll let the 1073 study and the early clinical experiences there be confirmatory around this.

 
Operator

We have a question from Joseph Stringer from Needham.

 



Joseph Stringer

Two from us.

 

Just curious on the guidance for – the 2 billion guidance for the US fall 2022 booster market.

Can you help us understand what assumptions are sort of built into that number?

 

Is that based on sort of your internal expectations around a relative percentage of individuals that would – fully vaccinated individuals that would get a booster or just trying to handicap what the variance could be around that.

And then, for CMV, can you give us a sense for the relative timelines for enrollment of that Phase III trial and when we could see the initial data from that?

 



Stéphane Bancel

On the fall of 2022, so the commercial team has spent quite a lot of time modeling different assumptions in terms of volume of people who want the booster, market share, and, of course, pricing.

 

I cannot comment further for competitive reason right now, especially on the pricing piece, but we will do that in due time.

But indeed, it's typical commercial analysis that the team that has done many times before in other companies have run through the last few months.

 



Stephen Hoge

And on the enrollment of CMV, thank you for the question.

 

The answer from our target perspective is as fast as we can because we ultimately think there's just such a huge unmet need here, and we're excited to get the study going.

There are some caveats that I should put around that, which is it probably won't be as fast as we did in COVID, which was obviously in a couple of months because we are targeting a population at high risk of disease.

 

And in this case, we're looking for women of child-bearing age who are exposed to seroconversion with CMV.

And that is often those that are exposed to children because that's the primary vector for those infections.

 

And so, we want to make sure that we get the right population.

And that matters because this is a case-driven study.

 

As we're kind of familiar with based on COVID-19, it's the number of cases that we achieve that will ultimately dictate those interim analyses that we're looking for in the time ahead.

And so, it makes sense to try and enrich for the at-risk population.

 

So you might see a slower enrollment curve or it might go really fast.

We're going to work as hard as we can to go very fast.

 

But the most important thing is that we need to be enrolling those that are at highest risk because we think that will ultimately generate the cases that accelerates the interim readout.

Because it is an interim readout that's driven on the cases, I can't predict when that will happen.

 

What I can do is I can try and enrich for those cases in the way I just described.
Operator

Next question is from Emmanuel Papadakis from Deutsche Bank.

 



Lavina Talukdar

We can go to the next question, operator.

 
Operator

And next is from Mani Foroohar with SVB Leerink.

 



Mani Foroohar

A couple of quick ones.

 

Can you give us a sense of when we might see, if any, the impact of pricing shift to increase deliveries to low and middle income countries that Stéphane mentioned.

Is that something that we'd start to see a little bit of early next year?

 

Is that more of a 4Q phenomenon in terms of the budgetary timing and sort of quarterly contract that Stéphane talked about.

Secondarily, I have a few small piggy jack question on the numbers.

 

On slide 15, the $6.7 billion in deposits, that presumably all for APAs for 2021 or 2022?

Or does some of that apply to APAs for delivery – for contracts for 2023.

 

Thirdly, your CapEx guidance a little lower than it was last Q.

Is that $50 million to $150 million that you took out of that, is that absolute savings?

 

Or is that just going to get pushed into next year as some of the contract revenues were?

And then finally, a little more substantive of a question.

 

How much perspective can you give us on you potentially compete for share on contracting in EU, the competitor Pfizer/BioNTech locked in pretty large contracts on volume for the next two years?

Is there an opportunity for you guys to start capturing more share [indiscernible] relevant in the EU?

 

And last, and finally, we talked on the last quarter about potentially access to China market where you guys are essentially not existing at this point.

And you have mentioned going there via JV.

 

Can you give us an update on status of your ability to access that market, discussion of the JV to compete with BionTech/Fosun?

Sorry for the barrage of questions, and thanks for taking the questions.

 



Stéphane Bancel

I'll take a few and, David, if you can take the financials, that would be great.

 

So, on Q4, we already actually picked COVAX product.

And the African Union will be in December, as we communicated in the press release.

 

And it's going to be a big ramp into next year, obviously.

In terms of European share, which was one of your questions.

 

So if you look at it, there's a few things.

First, in Europe, if you remember, we had a late and slow launch in Europe because we had no manufacturing capacity in Europe.

 

If you recall, when we had the pandemic, we had Norwood that we converted and we were not allowed to export outside the US market.

So Lonza came online a bit later than Norwood because we had nothing in Lonza until they started sometime in the summer to just get machines and get the facility ready.

 

And so indeed, in Europe, we have a lesser share than we have in the US, except, for example, for Switzerland like you saw earlier.

And so, as the country gets more and more of an understanding first that mRNA vaccines are superior, the other vaccines other than mRNA are not really used anymore.

 

That's my understanding.

They're mostly given through COVAX.

 

I think we have an interesting opportunity because as I shared, as you take – you talk to healthcare leaders, health minister, as you get more and more data that Paul shared, we have a better and better understanding that the two mRNA vaccines are not the same.

And so, again, as we look into 2022, we already have a contract with Europe for 2022.

 

And we are discussing also with country by country on the data and using the benefit of the Moderna vaccine versus the other one.

And then the other question that's going to stay in Europe, which is today, contracts are done at the European level because this was organized and agreed by Europe because of the pandemic.

 

The big question that's going to be out there is when do countries start to be buying by themselves because they have to make guesses of supply when they set up 2021 and 2022 agreements that might not meet the needs that they have, as we understand better the different profiles of the vaccine.

And so, I think it's going to be quite interesting to see the share opportunity that we have in Europe.

 

Also as we build our teams, you remember, we had no infrastructure in Europe, zero, not one Moderna employee in commercial.

We have now teams in several countries in Europe, in the UK, in Spain, in France, in Germany, building the Italian team as we speak.

 

So I think that will also help because we get feet on the ground to be able to get the message that – of a real world evidence data.

David, do you want to take the capital financial questions?

 



David Meline

In terms of the deposits, the $6.7 billion we have in hand, I would just say the preponderance of those deposits are for deliveries either in 2021 and in 2022.

 

There may be some small amounts in 2023, but it's pretty early in terms of the contracting there.

Secondly, in terms of CapEx, I think the answer is yes, you can expect, as I said – we're going to see a notable increase in our CapEx next year.

 

But generally, in terms of the reduction this year, it's a combination of things moving into the first quarter of next year and also we're running, in some cases, at or below the estimated investment requirements.

So it's a combination of those two.

 



Mani Foroohar

On potential China JV, I know you guys have mentioned it in the last call, I don't know if there's been any progress?

Jim Farley

Thank you, Lynn.

 

Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.

Well, this month marks one year since we'd began executing our Ford Plus Plan.

 

It creates growth, value, and it allows us to win in emerging area of electric and connected vehicles.

We built a strong team that combines top leaders from Ford with world-class talent recruited from outside of our Company.

 

Specific talents, specific people that are largely outside of our industry.

This leadership team is committed to this plan and we're accelerating our progress.

 

Ford Plus is not a tagline.

It's not advertising.

 

It's a larger, more ambitious way to think about our business and how we bringing value to our customers.

We're creating iconic and distinctive products that only four can do.

 

Increasingly, always on relationships with our customers and ever improving user experiences, all why creating value for our shareholders.

We're fully invested in this future.

 

And we're taking big swings.

Key to the plan is harnessing the power of connectivity.

 

We're designing a new generation of fully networked vehicles not delegated to our supply chain, but done inside the Company to revolutionize the experience of owning and operating Ford vehicle.

That's embedded technology to unleash unlimited innovation.

 

We're scaling the number of vehicles capable of over-the-air updates will be moving from 1 million vehicles today to 33 million by 2028.

That scale.

 

At the same time, we're moving aggressively to lead the electric vehicle revolution, substantially expanding our battery production as we speak today in the U.S.

Infact, we already announced plans that will give us enough battery production to meet our mid-decade goal of a 141 gigawatts, which is enough to build more than 1 million battery electric vehicles a year and I think we'll need more.

 

R7 billion investments in Blue Oval city in Tennessee in the BlueOvalSK park in Kentucky sets a new standard for scale sustainability, advanced manufacturing, and training the next-generation of technology leaders.

At the same time, the billion dollars of investment in our electrified center in Cologne, Germany will allow us to go all electric soon.

 

That center will be all electric by 2023.

We're making final preparations to launch the F-150 Lightning.

 

That defining 0 mission version of an America's best-selling vehicle for the past 40 plus years.

Our all electric Mustang Mach-E is a hit with customers, not just in the U.S., but around the world, bringing a stunning number of new customers to the Ford brand.

 

Over 90% of the Mach-E owners say they would recommend a Mach-E to other customers.

Critical as a new-generation of battery electric customers make new brand choices.

 

Our challenge now is to break production constraints and increase availability to meet this incredible demand both in North America and in Europe, and also in China, the biggest EV market in the world.

where we are just starting production and Mach-E.

 

We believe the global demand just for Mustang Mach-E could approach about 200,000 vehicles a year.

We've created new organization, Ford Pro to change and power the future of work with compelling commercial vehicles, distribution, and services.

 

While growing revenues to Ford.

In a few weeks, we will start production of the new E-Transit, an electric version in the world's best-selling commercial van.

 

And in the third quarter alone, FORDLiive, Europe 's new connected uptime center, which I wish you could all see for our commercial customers, helps customers in the UK secure additional up time, preventing about $8 million of lost revenue and associated costs for our valuable customers.

We're reinventing icons like Bronco and creating new ones like Maverick.

 

In fact, the all-new Maverick, 42 miles per gallon I might add, is the first standard hybrid pickup in the U.S.

It's also America 's most fuel-efficient hybrid pickup.

 

This is the strongest, most compelling lineup I'd ever seen from any mass market brand in my career.

And we are creating a spring loaded future as we emerge from the cheap shortages and COVID constraints.

 

And we continue to make important strides in the technology and go-to-market strategy for autonomous vehicles.

In the Second Quarter, we told you about a new partnership with Argo AI and Lyft.

 

And then the Third Quarter, we announced a new partnership with Argo AI and Walmart.

This is Walmart's first ever multi-city autonomous delivery service.

 

And it will be anchored in cities where we already have operations.

Not the easiest miles in one city, but multiple cities and hard miles.

 

In addition to making real progress on autonomy vehicles, operating domains, SDS, we fully support Argo AI 's aspiration to access public capital.

To build this future, and generate the margins and cash flow.

 

We need to fund Ford Plus; we had a turn around our automotive operations, and improve our competitiveness.

Our results in the third quarter show we are making significant progress.

 

In fact, Company-wide, we achieved an 8.4% EBIT margin, including 10.1% in North America.

Those margins, I will remind you are in line with our targets for 2023.

 

More importantly, our operations outside of North America are likely to post the best performance in 4 years.

Please note the performance in South America, largely driven by our success of our global redesign.

 

We've been able to achieve this while thoughtfully managing our supply chain for short-term sustainable improvements including semiconductors, and prioritizing high demand and high profit vehicles.

And before I turn it over to John, a few thoughts.

 

I believe we have the right plan to drive growth and unlock unprecedented value.

You are already seeing favorable change in the slope of our earnings and cash flow.

 

There's more to come.

Given the strength of our business this year, we are increasing our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to between 10.5 and 11.5 billion.

 

As we plan in earnest for next year, we're excited and energized about the opportunity in front of us and clear that we have so much more work to do to deliver on fourth potential.

The word I would leave you with is focus.

 

That competitive environment has never been more interesting and tough.

And we intend to live up to our promise to compete like a challenger focusing on our top priorities to unlock Ford Plus growth with customers at the very center of everything we do.

 

Now I will turn it over to John, who'll take you through our results for the quarter, our outlook for the full year, our capital allocation priorities, and our expectations heading into next year.

John?

 



John Lawler

Thank you, Jim.

 

Now in the face of continued industry-wide semiconductor constraints, we stayed focused on our plan, strengthening our portfolio, and investing in opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation.

We delivered a solid quarter with 3 billion in adjusted Company EBITDA, and a margin of 8.4%.

 

Free cash flow of 7.7 billion was as we expected up sharply on a sequential basis, driven by the positive working capital effects, from higher wholesales in EBITDA.

We ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity at over 31 billion and 47 billion respectively.

 

Now across our automotive business, our playbook remained consistent as we optimize production for customer orders, new launches, and our most profitable vehicles.

And as expected on a sequential basis, our wholesales improved dramatically its chip supply for Ford improved.

 

We also remained disciplined with incentive spending and mix management, which on a year-over-year basis, more than offset chip-related declines in volume.

Ford Credit delivered another solid quarter with 1.1 billion in EBT as auction values continue to remain strong, and credit losses continue at near record lows.

 

For the fourth Quarter, we're assuming a sequential increase in wholesale.

We also expect continued healthy mix and net pricing and solid results from Ford Credit, although not as strong as the Third Quarter.

 

Headwinds include inflationary impacts on commodities and freight, and we also expect plan sequential increases in our Ford Plus modernization investments, including customer experience and IT.

So let me share with you some highlights from the quarter before I turn to guidance, capital allocation, in our preliminary view of 2022.

 

With improved chips supply, North America wholesales increased sequentially by 67% as the team prioritized launches, customer orders, and high-margin units while reducing the number of vehicles built, but waiting for chips.

Demand remains strong for our exciting vehicles.

 

The order bank we are building paid off in the third quarter, representing 28% of our retail sales in the third quarter, and reaching a high of 31% in September.

And our overall customer orders increased over 50% from the Second Quarter to more than a 100,000 orders, excluding Bronco.

 

With the 10.1% EBITDA margin in the quarter, North America is now at a 9% margin year-to-date, just 100 basis points shy of our 2023 target of 10%.

South America, marked its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in EBITDA, and the business run rate is now approaching break even.

 

The region also launched its new commercial vehicle organization with the introduction of the new transit, which is manufactured in Uruguay.

This transit is the first light commercial van to market in Brazil that includes connectivity as a standard feature.

 

In Europe, the underlying trajectory of our business continues to strengthen though the adverse impact from chips has masked this improvement.

In the Third Quarter, the business lost about 50,000 units, which would have had a substantial favorable impact on EBITDA.

 

Our leadership, as the number one commercial vehicle brand continued in the quarter along with an extremely robust quarter bank.

In China, Lincoln continues to perform well, extending its success in the most profitable segment, luxury, with retail sales up 24% year-over-year.

 

In fact, Lincoln has doubled its share of the China luxury market over the past 18 months.

Our newly created BEV organization to open its first 13 direct-to-consumer Ford -select city stores, with a total of 25 expected to open by year-end.

 

In IMG, our leadership team in India made the difficult decision to end manufacturing; following accumulated operating losses of more than 2 billion over the past 10 years.

Going forward, we will focus on importing iconic vehicles, including EVs.

 

And overall, IMG had a solid quarter, capitalizing on our strengths, including ranger.

Now as Jim highlighted, the underlying strength of our business supports increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 to between $10.5 and $11.5 billion.

 

And that's despite a lower than anticipated improvement in cheap availability in the second half of the year.

Consistent with our adjusted EBITDA guidance three this year, our updated guidance for 2021 includes the $900 million non-cash gain on our investment in Rivian in our First Quarter adjusted results.

 

So let me spend a minute on Rivian.

Now, in the event that Rivian completes its IPO, we will record any gain on our investment in any subsequent adjustments of special items.

 

Accordingly, we will recast the 900 million non-cash gain from adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter to a special [Indiscernible] As Rivian completes their IPO in the fourth quarter, we will make this change when we report our fourth quarter earnings on February 3, 2022.

Our guidance for 2021 adjusted free cash flow is unchanged at 4 to 5 billion, reflecting the higher EBITDA, but less favorable improvement in working capital and timing differences.

 

Now this is due to lower than anticipated volumes than previously assumed in the back half of the quarter, and that's as a result of chip constraints.

We do expect free cash flow to increase with higher production, and the associated improvement in supplier payables and other timing differences.

 

Now let me turn to capital allocation, which again is the foundation of our value creation framework.

Our capital allocation discipline is driving a strong core business and Balance Sheet that provides the flexibility to invest in new growth opportunities as we deliver our Ford Plus plan.

 

Ultimately, and ensures we returned value to our shareholders, both in the form of a higher share price and dividends.

Today, we announced the reinstatement of our dividend.

 

Our board has approved restarting of regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Importantly, the dividend reflects our confidence in the improving run rate of the business and our ability to fund all of our calls on capital, including the growing investment in electrification and the trajectory of our Ford Plus plan.

 

The dividend was also sized to ensure we maintain appropriate optionality to manage continued uncertainties in the external environment.

To give you a better sense of our calls on capital between 2020 and 2025, we expect total capital expenditures of about 40-45 billion or run rate of roughly $7 billion per year.

 

Over the same time, we expect to invest over $30 billion in BEV.

And above the investment in BEV that’s about 50% is CAPEX, 25% is expense, and 25% is direct investments.

 

And these numbers, they'll be dynamic, and we are confident we have ample financial flexibility to increase our investments even if BEV adoption further accelerates.

And I'll let me share with you our early thinking about 2022, a year which like this one is likely to experience some industry crosswinds that could drive a range of outcomes that we typically don't talk about the upcoming year this soon.

 

And we're not yet prepared to give financial guidance, but we do want to share how we're thinking about next year, given the dynamic operating environment.

Ford's underlying strengths give me great confidence we can build on our results in 2021.

 

First, our portfolio of products and services is exceptional.

And we have a significant amount of new product coming to market spanning our iconic high-volume nameplate.

 

Second, our industrial base gives us significant optionality as the adoption of electric vehicles accelerates.

Third, driven by the chip shortage of roughly 4 million in wholesales, we are likely to deliver this year fall significantly below our capacity.

 

And based on our current assessment, we believe our wholesales to be up about 10% in 2022, but that number is very dynamic and changes almost weekly.

And fourth, the effects of our global redesign, which is largely completed, are now evident and substantial.

 

We have drastically de -risked and rationalized our global footprint and product lineup, vastly improving our earnings and cash generation power in the process.

Now for headwinds next year, it's difficult to predict the interplay between semiconductor-related constraints, volume and pricing and this will continue to remain dynamic.

 

For 2021, we expect commodities to be up 3 to 3.5 billion and they could be up another 1.5 billion in 2022, largely driven by steel and aluminum similar to this year.

There will also likely be other inflationary costs, but it's too early to size that right now.

 

Ford Credit is likely to be lower as strong auction values will be moderated by a smaller inventory of vehicles and lower lease end return rates.

And lastly, we're obviously going to continue to invest in our Ford Plus Plan for growth and value creation.

 

And this includes in customer-facing technology, connectivity, and our always on relationships with customers, and electrification.

And, of course, we believe long-term payback from those investments will be substantial.

 

Now that wraps up our prepared remarks.

And if you perceive that the upfront portion of these calls is becoming more efficient, well, you're right.

 

And that's a function of us being very specific with you and our team about what's truly important, and our confidence in executing effectively against those things and reporting accordingly will use the balance of the time here and address what's on your mind.

Thank you.

 
Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.

 



John Murphy

Good evening, everybody.

 

Thanks for making the call efficient.

I think it's going to be tough to limit to one question, but I will.

 

If you think about the 10% increase you are talking about in 2022 wholesales, and if we could focus on North America and just assume you're going to do about 2 million units this year in '21, give or take.

We're only talking about 200,000 units of increase next year.

 

There's just an assumption that the price and mix will deteriorate an incremental units are produced semi shortage is relieved.

But given that that's still gonna be a relatively low -- a very low level of production, do you believe that the price mix are really going to actually come under pressure next year and aren't we really going to stay in a very tight environment that you are selling through and not even building inventory if that's true, which means that pricing mix might stay very strong next year and we will still get the benefit.

 

Thanks John.

You're right.

 

It's going to remain dynamic and that's what the interplay is going to be volume increases for the industry.

They're higher, we'll probably see more pressure on price if they remain as they are today.

 

And we see a moderate increase; I think you're going to continue to see strong pricing and mix continue through next year.

So that's where we have to stay disciplined and we have to stay very focused on managing that well so that we can have, as you said, the play-through next year relative to what happens from an overall volume standpoint, and we're focused on that.

 

So I agree with you.

That's going to be one of the key dynamic elements for next year.

 

And just to follow-up on that.

I think right now, based on wards, you have about 213,000 units in dealer inventory.

 

Pre-COVID travel rate was about 650,000 units.

You think about ultimately getting into a time where you can rebuild or restock that inventory, where do you think that runs, and how much opportunity is there to try to maintain some of this mix and price discipline to offset any cost inflation, and also invest in the future?

 



John Lawler

Yeah, so if you look at where we ended in September, we ended at about 20 days’ supply in the U.S.

 

and we're watching it very closely from a day supply standpoint.

In -- as we talked about last quarter, in our historical base supply was somewhere around 75 days.

 

We're not going back there.

As Jim said, we're going to be very disciplined and we expect to be in the 50 days’ supply when we're fully at full capacity and we're running and producing everything that we can, so that's gonna be the key.

 

The other thing I would say, John, is that the move as we talked about in our remarks to having more of our sales come through orders, unlike orders in the order bank.

That's really important for us to manage our day supply.

 

So it's a less of a scrounge stock push through and its customer demand pull-through based on the orders and we had over a 100,000 orders at the end of the quarter and that's grown since then in our order bank and that play well for us in the third quarter.



Jim Farley

$139,454 order.

 



John Lawler

As of -- as of today.

 



Jim Farley

As of today.

 



John Murphy

To be exact that's it sounds like you are on that and maybe if I could sneak one in just on cap allocation real quick on the dividend.

 

I mean why now?

And I'll hop back in the queue.

 



Jim Farley

Yeah.

 

It's the underlying strength of the business, John.

And we're not capital constrained.

 

We're able to fund our initiatives for growth.

We know that there are going to be other opportunities that surface.

 

We're confident that we can fund those.

And we're focused on total shareholder returns.

 

Not only stock appreciation, but also the dividend.

And so given the strength of the business, the Board elected that we would restart the dividend this quarter.

 



John Murphy

Great.

 

Thank you very much.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.

 



Dan Levy

Hey, good evening.

 

Thank you for taking the question.

I would like to just like to ask a question on the shape of recovery in volumes A, is this magnesium shortage going to cause any term -- any sort of near-term supply disruption for you?

 

I mean, we heard some during the comments that I could just outright stop European production and just maybe you can give us a sense broadly how you anticipate the shape of recovery in terms of volumes -- at what point do we get or is your baseline expectation that the chip shortages fully mitigated that you can be back at full run rate production?



John Lawler

Yeah.

 

So from the magnesium standpoint, when we look at that, we are seeing price pressure on aluminum broadly, we saw that all year and probably see a little bit more price pressure due to the magnesium issue, but our sheet metal suppliers -- our sheet aluminum suppliers don't purchase magnesium from China for North American production.

So we don't see that having any significant impact or any impact on us.

 

We do see the chip issue continuing to run through 22, as we said, it's very dynamic.

Right now, if you ask us what we think the sequential increase in supply will be year-over-year, we think we will have about 10% more, but that's changing weekly.

 

And we're doing everything we can to get our hands on as many chips as we can.

But we do see that running through 2022, it could extend into 2023, although we do anticipate the scope and severity of that to reduce as we move through 22 into 23.

 



Dan Levy

Great.

 

Thank you.

Second question.

 

I'd like to be now, just a bit more strategic.

Think if we just look at the pace of progress at Ford, just both financially and in terms of EV all things digital and just overseeing today is far greater than what you we saw 12 or 18 months ago, which is actually pretty impressive given the large organizations, it takes time to really affect change.

 

I just want to I'm trying understand how much of what we're seeing today was something that was always there and it's just always starting to come to the surface now, there's sort of getting the fruits of prior initiatives or has something fundamentally changed in the past 12, 18 months?

What does this tell us about the pace of change at Ford has an extra period, maybe just to be a bit more specific, as I know, you can take that a number of ways.

 

Maybe you can answer that specifically to what we're seeing on product and planning on the business trends with that transition EBITDA



Jim Farley

Thank you for your question.

 

A lot of the product we've been working on for several years, we made the tough choices.

I would say the answer is we have a plan; it's not an advertising peer taglines.

 

It's our plan, everyone in the Company knows what we have to do.

We are out of time.

 

And we have focused.

We need to get an 8% margin like we did this quarter as a Company, regularly because we have to fund a high-growth BEV and digital business.

 

It's not to make more money -- yes, it is that.

But it's motivated in the mission of transforming Ford through these digital products.

 

So running the ICE business for cash, getting serious about our cost, our quality, our launches, our 8% return.

It's all a mission, and the team knows the plan and I think the culture is starting to change to be quicker, more accountability, less bureaucracy and that mission permeates through the Company.

 

I'm probably the worst person to ask whether something's changed, because it sure has changed for me, and my leadership team.

But to me the proof is in the putting like our third quarter.

 

And whether we really changed this Company will be proven out in our numbers over time, like to have the last year.



Dan Levy

And then just to be more specific on the product front, because I think we're seeing a much faster pace of products.

 

Is the time of developments, products, like how much have you accelerated that meaning typically in the past we would hear of 3.5 to 4 years of drawing boards that product and showroom.

Is there a new normal for what that is?

 



Jim Farley

If we make up our mind, and we come together as a team like we did on Maverick, it could be just 2 years.

 

We did -- we knocked 20 months off the Maverick development, but it required the leadership team to not have the hand-wringing on the studio for 6 months, like we normally did.

I think that's an improve point.

 

But the question I ask myself is a little different.

When we see a technology change like this, like BEV, it's not just the speed of your product creation.

 

It's can you be flexible and agile in your industrial system, like in manufacturing.

We have 3 complete hits on our hands; a Mach-E with 200,000 units of demand, that's we have the Lightning with over a 160,000 orders and the transits completely sold out.

 

So how I like to think about it, it's not just a product creation speeding up the total Company.

And we have to do our job to break constraints now, so that we can deliver hundreds of thousands of battery electric next year.

 

That to me is the proof of our change, not just our faster product creation process works.



Dan Levy

Great.

 

Thank you very much, very helpful.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.

 



Ryan Brinkman

Hi, thanks for taking my question.

 

I thought to ask a few on the order bank, just given the commentary that it grew 50% sequentially in 3Q, excluding the Bronco.

So can you talk about the benefits of the order bank?

 

How it helps to optimize your operations?

And what kind of pricing or other trends you might be seeing with regard to the order bank?

 

And then how much of the increase in orders do you think may stem from the currently very strong new product cadence or from the currently low inventory environment?

And what avenues are there available to drive orders as industry conditions eventually normalize?

 



Jim Farley

Thank you so much for your question.

 

I'll ask John to comment.

From my view, the order bank model that we're going to in North America that we're in right now, has benefits across the patch.

 

We are an incredibly complicated Company.

And so, having an order bank allows us to push simplification into the order that the customer facing options, which we need to do.

 

And a reduces costs and improves our quality.

Number 2, it eliminates the need for expensive conquest, fixed marketing.

 

Number 3, it's incredibly helpful for industrial system.

You cannot imagine Ryan how much money we waste by guessing what our launch mix is for new product.

 

When you have an order bank special for new models.

You could capacitize the high series mixes that are very profitable, right in line with customer demand.

 

So it's incredibly cost-effective.

And it allows you to address the long tail revenues that we've lost in the past because of our undrawn ground stock model.

 

And the last one is its lower cost.

There is less parts hanging around.

 

We can manage our industrial system and our manufacturing and a leaner way.

The question really is how we maintain it as you said, is the market improves and the way we are looking at that.

 

Is not just having a day supply target in the past that we've managed, but actually putting in the infrastructure to maintain, or prefer an order-based system.

That means we train our system to put in orders.

 

We reward people for putting in orders.

We dynamically price for customers so that they are incentivized to keep ordering versus buying off the lot.

 

So it's going to be a journey.

It's been a very rewarding one so far.

 

And we're just beginning.

This is the model we have to go through as most of our business are -- majority of our business goes battery electric and digital.

 

It's the right loyalty model.



Ryan Brinkman

Okay, great, thanks.

 

And then just as a quick follow-up to that, it seems as was discussed earlier, that product development times are speeding up, maybe particularly with regard to EV is the Lightning, for example, seem to together very fast.

Another trend seems to be that automakers are revealing their EV's for a longer period of time before the actual start of production, maybe because there's so eager to show them consumers are so clamoring for them.

 

Does that mean that you think that order banks and ordering in advance might be even more popular with electric vehicles?

What are you seeing with regard to that?

 



Jim Farley

The move to a digital product means we have to go to a 100% loyalty model.

 

So the reason why you're seeing us launch battery electrics early is very simple.

It's our Super Bollard.

 

Our new Super Bollard, or new Detroit Motor Show is our reveal.

because there's starts the clock on reservations and you have to do it early enough so you are industrial system gets informed by the results of your reservation.

 

That's the closed loop that has to happen.

We need to open it early enough so that our industrial system can react to the orders and we don't waste money and take advantage of long tail revenue.

 

And it's a more controlled environment than a broadcast media advertising on the Super Bowl.



Ryan Brinkman

Very helpful.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.

 



Rod Lache

Hi everybody.

 

I have just 2 questions.

So first you've got a lot of growth that you're targeting and in BEv's and digital businesses.

 

So it's not surprising that we would see some structural cost inflation.

What we're seeing right now is actually really benign.

 

It's 200 million and in the quarter, considering what you've got going on, but maybe can you talk a little bit about, how we should think about the feathering in of those additional structural costs, which presumably come in ahead of the revenue.

So how should we think about that as we look out to the next year or 2?

 



John Lawler

Yeah, Rod.

 

We'll start to see those come in as we get into 22 and then they'll feather in to 23 as we continue to ramp our investments in our plan, our priorities.

Not only in the products, the BEv's, but also as we're building out our customer facing technologies, our connectivity, etc.

 

So yeah, you will see that start to come in on a year-over-year basis next year and it will continue into 23.



Rod Lache

Can you just give us any sort of brackets around what I mean you did mention that 25% of the EBITDA spending will be expense, but any sort of thoughts on the magnitude of what that headwind is?

 



John Lawler

Not -- I'm not ready to do that today for '22 and going in through '23.

 

We're completely targeted on getting to that 8% in 2023, so we'll manage it within that.

But today, I'm not ready to talk in that level of detail about.

 



Rod Lache

Okay.

 

And I was a little surprised about the comment about just 10% volume growth for next year.

It seems to me like the Renesas fire in Texas storms alone might have not 200,000 units off of your production in Q2, and it wasn't too long ago you guys were routinely doing over 700,000 units a quarter.

 

So do you have any thoughts that you might be able to share about when -- would you be able to get back up to that kind of a level of production, and if so, when should we expect that to happen?



John Lawler

Right.

 

I think what you'll find is that as you look through 2022, the first half will have less supply than through the second half.

And as I said earlier, we see this mitigating over time.

 

It may extend into 2023.

But I would say that we should be back up and running based on what we're seeing today, our run rate, the end of next year into '23.

 

And then in 2023, we'd start to rebuild our inventories.

But it's dynamic, Rod, and it's hard to make a pinpoint call at this point in time.

 

But we wanted to share with you what we're seeing is that -- we're seeing about 10% for next year, and we see that the chip constraints is going to still...[Indiscernible] going to still be at [Indiscernible].

So we have to keep managing as we are this year.

 



Rod Lache

Got it.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.

 



Brian Johnson

2 questions.

 

First, a quick quite housekeeping, but definitely Balance Sheet question.

As you stated the dividend at the level, just could you maybe talk us through the investment grade rating implications and timeline to get there that you are and the board considered when setting that.

 



Jim Farley

So we're gonna continue to work and focus on improving our business, right?

 

Our target is to have an investment-grade Balance Sheet, but that's going to come by improving the business, and you're seeing the strength of that come through.

And so, that's what we're focused on.

 

What the rating agencies to -- decide to do with our rating, they'll manage that.

That's up to them.

 

What we're laser-focused on is improving the run rate of the business, improving our performance, improving our overall metrics, and eventually, the rating agencies and the ratings will take care of themselves.



Brian Johnson

Okay.

 

Second question.

As you think about that 10% volume increase rough guidance.

 

A couple of things One, where do you see fleet sales coming back as you kind of bring that up and second, are you going to take a different attitude towards fleet sales than in Ford of the past?

I remember Don Leclair saying he had 2 factories making Tauruses and when took our companies, we're about the only buyer so that several.

 

But there are also really rental cars, but maybe some of the government business that's not pleased with not quite the same and related to that as you think about prioritizing production or their models where you're more comfortable, you'll get good price retention.

And other models, and I'm gonna pick on like the escape maybe, that have a lot of competition in their segment.

 

And as capacity comes back, less likely to hold price, say compared to our Bronco.



John Lawler

So it's interesting because I remember those days when Don probably made that comment about rental fleets and that they were low margin, etc.

 

I think what you're finding is business models are changing and the fleet business is evolving just like everything else in our industry.

And we see that there could potentially be a positive fleet business where there could make good money.

 

And so we're not going to shy away from that if we see that its right for our brand and we think is right for the bottom line.

And so we're going to continue to look at fleets differently and we're going to continue to think about vehicles as-a-service and what that potential holds for us is that business model changes and we'll see where that takes us.

 

But we're not going to go back to the times where we're putting in capacity; we're pumping out unit, selling them at little to no margin for rental cars.

That's not going to happen again.

 



Brian Johnson

I'm sorry.

 



John Lawler

It's okay, I was just going to see our fleet business now.

 

Now that we've rationalized the Company, our fleet business is very strategic for us.

It's also very profitable.

 

It certainly varies in Europe, and North America, and China.

Different fleet segments have different profitability.

 

The one thing I would ask you to think about is that most of fleet that matters at Ford is commercial vehicles.

And the most important commercial vehicles for us are small, medium-sized businesses.

 

And those are very profitable business for us, for transit, for super duty.

That's where Ford excels in the fleet business.

 

And it's smaller fleets, it's not big fleet sales.

So the texture of this is that we're revenue managing the Company very carefully.

 

We know the margins by geography, even within the country and we know by distribution channel.

So this is a very thoughtful approach for us, but strategically, especially because of the Pro business and its profitability, we want to make sure we have where reliable partner with fleet customers.

 

They do business with companies that are reliable, that don't come in and out of the market, they do business with companies that have a full range of products, a full range of services.

That's why Marion is investing in Ford Pro, and why we're vertically integrating our services.

 



Jim Farley

So I think we have a really good, profitable fleet business around the world.

 

We look at the margins very carefully, but it's strategically very important for the Company to be a reliable partner.



Brian Johnson

Okay.

 

And then in terms of price retention and how that's going to vary, caution product line?



Jim Farley

Well, John, I think you should you should answer that one in terms of how we revenue manage in a constrained environment.

 



John Lawler

Yeah.

 

So as you would expect, we're very conscientious about the dynamic of the supply and demand and the impact that has on the pricing and we look at this on a daily basis managing our incentives, looking at if we should be taking top-line pricing given the inflationary pressures we're seeing.

As we talked about, we're not going to go back to the old habits of loading of the dealers with stock and then looking through the push through for sales, were going to focus more on orders coming through online.

 

Specific orders to customers being satisfied, understanding what their demands are, simplifying the system.

And with all of that, we expect to retain quite a bit of a price.

 

Now will it mitigate as we go through next year as supply and demand comes more in Bell and in '23?

Yes.

 

But our job is going to be to manage that and retain as much pricing as we can.

And while providing customers good value for those products.

 

So it's something that we look at very closely on a daily basis.



Brian Johnson

Thank you.

 



Jim Farley

In the Escape business, we now have another player called Bronco Sport, in a segment.

 

It's incredibly profitable and people really appreciate the product.

We're know in the business of commodity products in that segment anymore, we changed, we made investments several years ago.

 



Brian Johnson

Right.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo.

 



Colin Langan

Great.

 

Thanks for taking my questions.

I just want to clarify, as part of your original guidance was that the first -- the second half was supposed to be up in volume 30%.

 

I mean, I'm not sure if I'm misreading it, it sounds like Q3 maybe up a bit from Q4.

So is that 30% still not accurate?

 

Obviously, it's important when you think about the 10% to 2022 web-based are going off.



John Lawler

Yeah, Colin, that's a great question.

 

Thank you.

Now, we did say last quarter that we expected the second half to be up about 30% looks like it's going to be up somewhere around 15%.

 

And so what you're seeing flow-through is the strength we had in the quarter relative to the top line and other actions that we took relative to cost, etc.

So when you look at that walk, that bridge between Q3 to Q4, we expect market factors to be positive.

 

We also said, we think volume is going to be up sequentially about 10% and also see a little bit stronger, stronger mix continuing, and then of course you'll have some product-related costs, production-related costs associated with that.

But net -- net market factors, net of those costs to produce the increased volumes is going to be positive.

 

We're seeing from a headwind standpoint, if you look at Q3 to Q4 our commodities, we expect that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they are going to be up about $700 million.

And if you look at that so far, year-to-date, we've seen about $1.6 billion of commodities hit us.

 

When you get to the Fourth Quarter.

You can get the Cumulus factor that on a year-over-year basis, commodities are going to be up about another billion five in the Fourth Quarter.

 

Year-over-year up a billion five sequentially, up $700 million.

And then we are going to see some higher warranty costs on a sequential basis in the Fourth Quarter for things that we have to take care of around extended warranties and a little bit higher coverages.

 

But again, on a year-over-year basis, our warranty will improve in the fourth quarter.

In full-year, on a year-over-year basis, our warranty, we expect to be good by about a billion for.

 



Colin Langan

Got it.

 

Right.

That's very helpful.

 



John Lawler

So does that help you with the bridge?

 



Colin Langan

Yes -- no, that's great.

 

I just -- secondly, in terms of the redesign plan that's been out for a while, is India the last major step?

I mean, is this going to sort of -- is this it, or next quarter may be the last time we see these slides?

 

Just kind of curious.

Or is there more still coming?

 



Jim Farley

Well, I think we're in good shape for now.

 

Obviously the acceleration of the BEV business, and our ICE assets will be, I think the next big transition for the whole industry, not just Ford.

But Ford specifically, India's really the principal region country where we have struggled over time.

 

And it's really great to see the progress the team is making in India and the very vibrant position will now have with the new lineup.

And I'd just like to highlight the progress in North America for this quarter.

 

John when's last time we were profitable in South America?



John Lawler

I believe it was 2013.

 



Jim Farley

So let -- let's hang that in the air for 2013.

 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC.

 



Joseph Spak

Thank you.

 

Maybe just one quick one on the free cash guidance or so.

I think you maintained despite the EBITDA guidance went higher.

 

So is there something going on with working capital because you're, you're saying you're releasing more vehicles, so I wouldn't think that would actually be positive factor in the fourth quarter as well as from curious what the offset is.



John Lawler

Yeah.

 

So what we're seeing there is that we've got the EBITDA coming in, right that improvement, but the less favorable improvement in working capital and timing differences hitting us in the quarter.

Because we have lower than anticipated volume in the back half of the quarter due to the chip constraints, and so we get with that working capital at the end of the year.

 

So that's what's happening to us on the free cash flow, so it's a timing issue.



Joseph Spak

Okay, and then I want to go back to some of the announcements you've made over the past couple of months and you talked again about the spend today.

 

And end up spending more than 30 billion.

And I appreciate the breakdown you gave us, sort of how you're spending that.

 

Maybe this is just me but I actually find it still fairly difficult to track what exactly you're spending over the coming year because I believe some of that has already been spent.

So is it possible to maybe just say like olive that 30 billion, what's being spent, like starting next year through the middle of the decade?

 



John Lawler

So of the 30 billion, when you look at the cap, very little.

 

We said about half of that was cap.

Very little of that has been spent through 2021 relative to the 13 to 15 billion, about half of it.

 

Of course, you're going to see the expense front-loaded because that's primarily be engineering that we have in developing the battery electric vehicles.

And then the direct investment, which is about 25% of it bats with things like the virtual go integration of J.D.

 

and those types of things.

And you saw those announcements this quarter with our plan in BlueOvalSK, the battery plans.

 

That's how we're going to unfold that bad spending over time.



Joseph Spak

That's helpful.

 

I appreciate it.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.

 



Itay Michaeli

Great.

 

Thanks.

Good evening, everybody.

 

Two quick ones from me.

First, is there any update on the BlueCruise deployment, including through OTA, maybe some initial customer feedback?

 



Jim Farley

Great.

 

Thank you.

We're shipping with marquee F-Series now BlueCruise as they leave the factory and we're going to be OTA in BlueCruise in the first quarter.

 

We wanted to improve the customer experience, so we've pushed it back in terms of an OTA because we wanted to be much simpler for the customer than was originally planned and that takes a little planning to consolidate.

Often these level 2 systems require multiple updates in the car.

 

We wanted to be very simple that took a little bit more work on our team's part, and so it's available.

as we ship products now and as in OTA, it'll be in the first quarter and it will be a lot simpler to use.

 

And get that OTA and update for the customer than it was originally planned.

Does that answer your question?

 



Itay Michaeli

Yeah.

 

That's very helpful.

And then maybe just does super quick follow-ups, just a point of clarification.

 

Thank you for 2022 initial indications.

And at least you mentioned you expect to build on the strong performance in 2021.

 

I am just curious if that if we should interpret that as you expect to grow EBITDA adjusted year-over-year in 2022.



John Lawler

Yeah so we're not going to give a number at this point and say, but what we're saying is that the strength of our new product lineup, our high-volume nameplates like in the strength of what we're seeing Rod Lache, as Jim said, we think there's about demand for 200,000 units.

 

We've got the Bronco, Maverick, E-Transit, and F-150 Lightning is coming.

It's the best lineup that we had, and so that's going to be a tailwind for us for sure as we go into next year.

 

You're seeing that come through this year, and we're going to build on that.

But we're also going to have to manage the headwinds that we've talked about.

 

And the other puts and takes but what we can tell you is we are laser-focused on getting to the 8% target in 2023.

And so we will manage into next year.

 

These are the types of things we're seeing from a puts and takes standpoint strength, the tailwinds and headwinds.

And we will manage that next year and will be on the path next year towards our 8% target in 2020.

 



Itay Michaeli

Great, that's super helpful.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.

 



Emmanuel Rosner

Thank you very much and good evening.

 

2 questions please.



John Lawler

Good evening.

 



Emmanuel Rosner

Hi, two questions.

 

The first one very pleased to see beyond target and for this 8% margins by 2023, big focus of the Company and clearly showing some progress there.

How should we think about the impact on this from the margins on your electric vehicles?

 

Obviously, the scale takes some time to build up, but Europe going through that right now, and probably has some level of visibility.

What are what's really leader thinking around trajectory for margins on some of your EVs, and to what extent you will, or will not impact overall Company margins, and potentially, how do we think about it beyond 2023?

 



Jim Farley

Thanks, such an important question for the Company.

 

I'd like John to comment on the margins.

Right now, we have 3 high-volume.

 

Very well accepted battery electric vehicles on our hands.

Mach-E, E-Transit and the F - F-150 Lightning.

 

So the way we look at it is we want to grow this business really fast.

Just the Mach-E demand itself we think is 200 thousand units that do not include the Lightning or the E-Transit.

 

Our first job is course post-job one customer experience improvement.

Post-job one simplification and improvement of the cost vehicle and post-job one quality improvements using the data off the vehicles.

 

Perhaps our biggest job in my opinion, is to break the constraints we have in manufacturing and our supply chain, so we can get these products out to these customers.

That post-job one orientation is quite different than how we historically looked at the ice business where we wait to a minor change or something later to make those changes.

 

The constraint for Mach-E right now as batteries, we think we can break some of those constraints by working creatively with our China team and get our batteries from China.

So stay tuned and I'll ask John to comment on the margins.

 



John Lawler

As we talked about last quarter Mach-E is EBITDA profitable today, but we also know that the margins are not as strong as our ICE margins.

 

And so we're working on that.

Overtime we expect as we scale, as you said and as the technology costs come down, we will grow those margins and ultimately, we do expect with these connected vehicles is connected bands that the profit margins will be better than what we're seeing on ICE today but that's over time.

 



Emmanuel Rosner

Thank you.

 

And then my second question was on Argo.

So [Indiscernible] you see that you would like to encourage them as supportive of accessing the public markets.

 

How do you envisage the future relationship between Ford and our book to be how important and is that going to be as part of your overall business model?



Jim Farley

Mission critical for us to truly disrupt personal ownership.

 

We have to democratize shared mobility.

And the self-driving and mobility in the driven world are absolutely mission-critical for the Company and disruptive itself.

 

I am really proud of the team's progress.

It's different than our competitors in the space.

 

We've gone to the most difficult miles in 4 or 5 different cities.

Our mapping, our SDS deployment, and the algorithms are built to be scaled for production deployment.

 

So we're not going to a small market area and easy miles like others.

We're taking on the toughest problems now and building our capability for scaling quickly.

 

And I think that's always been our approach.

The relationship with Argo and us and Volkswagen is very close, but we do see us moving into more of a production mode now.

 

And we're really ready for that.

And we think this will take capital and little more time.

 

and we think the access to public capital is really mission-critical for our journey.



Emmanuel Rosner

Thank you.

 
Operator

Final question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.

 



Adam Jonas

I think explained as [Indiscernible] all this on in the [Indiscernible] the way you have.

 

Right.

So you get curious for that.

 

You're saying some of the competitors, critical investments in the downstream to make up for that customer experience, Volkswagen buying your car, and some stocks including ones that you know pretty well.

Kind of part of it.

 

Was there any gap in your strategy [Indiscernible] really [Indiscernible] is vertically integrate [Indiscernible] franchises [Indiscernible] suspicion given the change in [Indiscernible] tax.



Jim Farley

Great question.

 

Our philosophy is different.

We think partnerships on the demand layer for our autonomy and Priya autonomy is making critical for our always on strategy.

 

Are there pieces missing that we're working really hard on [Indiscernible]?

We're not going to talk about it today though.

 



Adam Jonas

Alright [Indiscernible] that might be [Indiscernible] because [Indiscernible] with [Indiscernible] starting to see Candle GPU [Indiscernible].

 

We're big chunk of the price of got a question.

Do you think there's [Indiscernible] that you can capture [Indiscernible] the consumer?

 



Jim Farley

Well, this is also really important.

 

First of all, I would say the heart and soul of Ford strategy is our commercial business.

And that business where vehicles are highly utilized.

 

Our dealer network is one of our most important advantages versus the new competitors.

I will give you some statistics.

 

We have 650 dedicated commercial, mostly service centers in the U.S.

in 850 transit centers across Europe.

 

So that will take a lot of time and a lot of money for someone to recreate.

Every one of those dealers has multiple bodybuilders that can call design for those trades.

 

And those vacation locations for our Ford vehicles.

So the dealer body is not only important for the after sales experience and making sure those vehicles can be serviced but it's also mission-critical for the outfit of those products.

 

The dealer network is absolutely strategically critical for our leadership and maintaining that as we go to digital connected vehicles for our commercial customers.

There's no doubt that many customers want us 3 or 4 clicks very easy service experience on the retail side.

 

We're working really carefully on that, including a simple e-commerce platform.

And actually in China, our BEV business already has 25 direct stores by the end of this year.

 

So we're starting to experiment.

I think our dealers and served us really well.

 

I'm very proud of them.

I'm especially proud of our commercial dealer and we're, we're very vigilant.

 

You can imagine I get lots of e-mails every day about transaction prices from customers on our hottest products.

And we all feel obligated to represent the brand professionally for our customers.

This concludes the Ford Motor Company's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.

 

Thank you for your participation.

You may now disconnect.

 ","Operator

Good morning and welcome to General Motors.

 

Third quarter 2021 earnings conference call.

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.

 

After the opening remarks, we will conduct the question-and-answer session.

We are asking analysts to please limit yourself to 1 question and a brief follow-up.

 

[Operator instructions ].

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday October 27, 2021.

 

I would now I'd like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.



Rocky Gupta 

Thanks, Jamie.

 

Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for this third quarter of 2021.

Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on the GM Investor Relations website.

 

We're also broadcasting this call via webcast.

I'm joined today by Mary Barra, GM's chair and CEO, Paul Jacobson, GM CFO, and Dan Berce, President of GM Financial.

 

Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set.

The content of our call will be governed by this language.

 

I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra.



Mary Barra

Thanks, Rocky, and hello everyone.

 

It's great to have an opportunity to talk with you all again today.

Before Paul and I discuss our third quarter results, I want to thank all of you who participated in person or remotely in our recent Investor Day.

 

Our team really appreciated the opportunity to deep dive our growth strategy and to hear your perspective.

After spending time with our leaders and subject matter experts, I hope it's clear to you that we have assembled the right technology to have the right platforms and we have the right talent to achieve our long-term goals, including doubling our annual revenue and expanding our margins.

 

Our confidence comes from the fact that we are already making significant progress in transforming GM, from a traditional automaker to really a platform innovator.

You can see it in the conversion of the Orient assembly and factory 0 plants as they have gone from building gas-powered cars to EVs, the construction of our Ultium Cell JV plants, the rapid expansion of Super Cruise, the development of level 2 plus autonomy with Ultra Cruise, the lead Cruise has in level 4 autonomous driving and our portfolio of 20 startup businesses.

 

You can also experience it in the software and services that will enhance our customers lives and drive growth.

And you can see it in our talent and expertise.

 

This includes the new digital business team that we formed to establish digital market leadership for GM and our expanded board of directors who have deep experience in IT, E-commerce, software development, venture capital, cybersecurity, and more.

As one of you observed, the real magic happens in our vehicles at the intersection of the Ultium and Ultifi platforms.

 

Ultium enables us to efficiently deliver the industry's broadest portfolio of EVs, including a diverse portfolio of truck entries.

And the beauty of Ultifi is the way it will allow us to deploy new software and services rapidly and securely across our entire fleet.

 

This includes Super Cruise upgrades and services we'll create in the future.

And seeing is believing.

 

I have to tell you, I will never forget the overwhelmingly positive reaction that people had after they experienced Super Cruise or had an opportunity to ride in the GMC Hummer EV and experienced Watts to Freedom for the very first time.

The same can be said for the Cadillac LYRIQ, that we'll begin delivering to customers next spring.

 

They were spoken for in just about 10 minutes after we opened the reservation site, so I think that starts to show the strong demand that we will see for the Lyriq.

Our next EV reveal will be the Chevrolet Silverado EV and I can tell you the truck is amazing.

 

Our dealers love it and so you won't want to miss it when we take the cover off at CES in early January.

It will evoke passionate enthusiasm through great design and engineering and we believe it will drive mass adoption of electric vehicles, specifically trucks.

 

And I promise you that the capabilities of Ultium and Ultifi will be just as evident in mass market vehicles like the $30,000 Chevrolet EV crossover, which we showed.

And as Mark shared, we’re also working on another EV that's even more affordable than that.

 

But to be clear, we will also continue to improve the successful ICE vehicles that are funding our future.

And we'll do that while improving them to reduce emissions and also offer new technologies.

 

Our plan provides resources to maintain leadership in key segments like trucks and SUVs during and after the transition to electric vehicles.

And although it's only been about 3 weeks since Investor Day, the strategies and initiatives we talked about have advanced even further.

 

Let's talk first about our work to build a strong and secure battery supply chain in North America.

We've established and announced 4 major supply chain initiatives recently, and we expect to add more soon to support our growth, our performance, and our cost reduction plans.

 

And our goal is to eliminate supply chain risks that control -- and control our own destiny as we rapidly scale our EV volumes.

A common thread that runs through these and our recent announcement is a clear commitment to U.S.

 

leadership in EVs.

For example, we will add 2 more battery plants in the U.S.

 

by mid-decade.

We also have plans to build EV motors and another EV truck facility here in the U.S.

 

We look forward to sharing the details very soon, but keep in mind, this is just the beginning.

As Gerald said at Investor Day, we forecast that North American EV assembly capacity will reach 20 % by 2025, and climbed to 50 % by 2030.

 

We're also bringing Ultium to China starting with the Lyriq, which is launching in early 2022, and GM China also recently announced it's doubling the size of its advanced design center to support EV development.

Cruise is the second opportunity that I want to highlight.

 

As you know, we have always gated the progress of Cruise by safety.

As we speak, Cruise is just one state level approval away from full regulatory approval to charge customers for rides in San Francisco.

 

And it is still the only Company with a permit to provide full driverless ride-hailed service in the city.

As Cruise CEO, Dan Ammann, said, complementary skills of GM and Cruise have brought it to the cusp of commercialization.

 

This includes the launch of the Cruise Origin that will be produced at Factory ZERO and we have already built dozens of engineering development vehicles like the ones you saw during Investor Day.

All of this is why joining Cruise is so high among experts in artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics; and why Cruise is hosting another series of virtual recruiting events called Under the Hood on November 4th.

 

If you'd like to participate, please contact GM Investor Relations.

Now, let's turn to earnings.

 

As we have shared before we are taking advantage of GM's strong cash flow to fund our investments in growth.

Our third quarter results, which, while reflecting the near-term challenges of the global semiconductor supply chain issues, clearly shows the strength of our underlying business.

 

We reported EBIT adjusted of 2.9 billion, which includes another strong performance by GM Financial and our joint ventures in China, as well as a recall cost settlement with LG.

LG has been and continues to be a very valued and respected partner and we are working closely with them to deliver replacement battery modules for our customers.

 

In fact, we began scheduling and completing repairs this month.

While the semiconductor situation improves, I believe our full-year performance will be strong from an earnings perspective and far ahead of where we expect it to be at the beginning of the year.

 

And most importantly, as we manage this dynamic environment, our clear focus is on transforming GM.

Now I'm going to turn the call over to Paul, who will share more about the quarter and our outlook.

 



Paul Jacobson

Thank you, Mary.

 

And good morning, everyone.

We appreciate you taking the time to join us.

 

We outlined our long-term strategy earlier this month, including the opportunity to double our revenues and expand margins by 2030.

We believe that the strength of our underlying business today is a crucial element to delivering on that growth, and I'm proud of the execution by our team during the quarter in the face of continued challenges.

 

So let's get into the results of the quarter in more detail.In Q3, we generated $26.8 billion in net revenue, $2.9 billion in EBIT adjusted, 10.9% EBIT adjusted margin, and $1.52 in EPS diluted adjusted.

Adjusted automotive free cash flow was negative $4.4 billion during the quarter, due to higher work-in-process inventory related to vehicles produced without certain modules and working capital impacts from plant downtime in lower production levels, as a result of the ongoing semiconductor shortage.

 

We expect the impact on working capital to unwind contributing to positive free cash flow as production increases and vehicles built without the modules are completed and wholesaled.

We realized strong price and mix performance in North America again, through our production prioritization actions and our go-to-market strategies.

 

Additionally, used vehicle prices drove continued excellent results at GM Financial.

In the quarter, we also reached an agreement with LG to substantially recover the cost of the recall.

 

The pretax impact to the quarter of this recovery agreement and associated recall was $700 million.

So let's take a closer look at North America.

 

In Q3, North America delivered EBIT adjusted of $2.1 billion with continued strong pricing on our full-size pickups and SUVs, and the recovery agreement with LG.

We generated a 10.3% EBIT adjusted margin in the region.

 

From a pricing standpoint, we're continuing to see high customer demand for our products and limited dealer inventory, which is driving strong transaction prices and lower incentive spend.

In the quarter, our incentive spend as a percentage of ATP fell to 4.67%, 7.4 percentage points below Q3 2020.

 

And even with these ATPs, we're growing or maintaining share in key segments.

For example, almost seven out of every ten customers in the full-size SUV segment purchased a Tahoe, Suburban, or Yukon.

 

The Escalade remains the best selling large -- luxury SUV by a significant margin.

That said, our overall volume in inventories remain low, which is impacting total market share in the region.

 

We ended the quarter with approximately 129,000 units in U.S.

dealer inventory.

 

We foresee low inventories and strong pricing continuing well into next year, even as production volumes are expected to increase.

Let's move to GM international.

 

GMI EBIT adjusted was $200 million, up 200 million a year over a year, as we experienced positive price and mix benefits across the segment.

China equity income was $300 million in the quarter, despite the semiconductor impacts due to continued strong mix, stabilization in pricing, and material cost performance.

 

GMI excluding China equity income has made substantial progress toward breakeven despite the impact of semiconductors, reinforcing the structural progress on our path to sustainable profitability and cash flow.

A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and corporate segments.

 

GM Financial has continued its record-setting pace with Q3 EBT adjusted of $1.1 billion as used vehicle prices and favorable consumer credit trends continue.

We've received $1.8 billion in dividends from GM Financial year-to-date.

 

And we anticipate additional dividends to be paid in the fourth quarter.

Cruise losses in the quarter were $300 million and Corp EBIT was a loss of $200 million in line with our run rate estimates of general and administrative costs, including investments in growth and our new businesses.

 

Let's turn to the outlook for the rest of the year.

Despite some ongoing volatility in the supply chain which our teams continue to work to mitigate, we expect sequentially higher volumes in Q4.

 

We also expect costs from commodities and logistics to increase along with investments in our growth initiatives.

I want to make sure that we clearly articulate how we're performing relative to the guidance we have in the market.

 

As you recall, we began the year with a guided range of $10 to $11 billion of EBITDA adjusted and provided updated full-year EBITDA adjusted guidance at Q2 earnings of $11.5 to $13.5 billion.

We now expect to achieve EBITDA adjusted approaching the high end of that range.

 

Our EPS diluted adjusted range will increase to $5.70 to $6.70 driven by a revised full-year effective tax rate due to favorable tax determinations in a mix of global earnings.

We also expect to achieve EPS diluted adjusted approaching the high end of that range.

 

Now I want to provide an update on our capital spending, including investments in Ultium JVs.

We now expect spend to be in the $8 to $9 billion range this year, slightly below the 9 to $10 billion range we previously provided.

 

This decrease is a result of both innovative work by our team to reduce required capital investments, while maintaining the schedule on our upcoming product programs, as well as certain timing of invoices that will shift into early '22.

Adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year is expected to be approximately $1 billion.

 

Note that this guidance now includes the impact of remaining work in process inventory related to vehicles produced without certain modules at the end of the year.

Through the fourth quarter, we expect to clear the majority of our work-in-process inventory, but anticipate some inventory will remain at year-end.

 

As we've indicated, these units will provide additional cash flow in the first half of 2022 as we wholesale the vehicles.

To close, we're at an inflection point for GM and we're focused on new metrics and KPIs as we progress on this journey.

 

We plan to begin to provide some interim milestones and KPIs that we will use to benchmark our performance relative to the growth plan that we laid out at our Investor Event.

We look forward to sharing that with you in the coming months.

 

As we execute on our growth plan, we will maintain the strong business we have today and these results demonstrate that.

This concludes our opening comments and we'll now move to the Q and A portion of the call.

 
Operator

A reminder to analyst, we are asking to limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so that we may get to everyone on the call.

 

Our first question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.



Dan Levy

Hi.

 

Good morning, everyone.

And thank you.

 

First, just a question on the pace of volume recovery.

Can you just tell us do you have any risk from the emerging magnesium shortage?

 

And then, maybe you could just tell us your expectations on what the pace of improvement is in volumes, what the baseline expectations is for when the supply shortages will be fully mitigated?

Just the shape of recovery ahead.

 



Mary Barra

Yeah, thanks, Dan.

 

Related to the Chinese magnesium shortages.

Well, we do think there is some near-term price escalation risk.

 

We do not see it as a significant supply risk or constraint for our North America operations.

The aluminum alloys we purchased have a very small percent of magnesium and nearly all of our aluminum is domestically sourced.

 

So we are working with our supply base and we continue to monitor the situation.

We'll take appropriate mitigation steps if needed but that's our view right now.

 

And Paul, I'll let you talk volumes.



Paul Jacobson

Sure.

 

Good morning, Dan.

Thanks for your question.

 

So when we outlined the second half trajectory on volume, we said that we expected it to be down approximately 200,000 units.

Second half to first half with the majority of that occurring in Q3.

 

That's certainly what we have seen.

So we expect a pretty sizable step-up in volume sequentially from Q3 into Q4.

 

That being said, when we look at Q4 volumes, they look more like what we saw volumes in the second quarter, but we have significant additional cost pressures that we've seen, most of which relate to either commodity inflation or more importantly, investments that we're making in the growth side of the business and in our manufacturing facilities as well.

So volume is certainly recovering off of where we were in Q3 ,which is consistent with what we said, and we would hope to see that and expect to see that as we go through 2022.

 



Dan Levy

Okay.

 

So continued improvement through 2022, it sounds like.

That was just a sequential -- you have ongoing sequential improvements..

 

Okay.

Thank you.

 

My second question is -- I want to draw -- a question on EV margins.

I want to draw a comparison with a certain EV automaker which just put up a very strong third quarter, and I think you're finally starting to see the EV margins materialize [Indiscernible] have in the past now, I know you put out the target for your BEV margins to be equal to or better than ICE, and I know in battery, you laid out certain battery targets that's going to be a big part.

 

But I'm wondering if you could just walk us through maybe the other areas where you could see opportunity to boost EV margins, setting aside the software opportunity, just how easily those things could be attained.

Is it just better architecture consolidation, greater vehicles simplicity?

 

Is it more in-sourcing or more digital, or quasi direct-to-retail sales?

Just what other opportunities are there to improve the EV margins aside from the battery cost?

 



Mary Barra

Sure.

 

You rattled off a lot of them, Dan.

Obviously, as we get scale -- the battery improvement is not insignificant but as we get the scale part of that and get scale with the vehicles, I think you're going to see margins improve.

 

We definitely are leveraging the Ultium platform and being able to launch in roughly half the time, there's just savings coming from that from a less engineering because we already are working off the platform as well as the way we've done the control system.

And we're looking across all aspects of the vehicle to ensure that EVs are affordable, really focused on what customers want.

 

We do extensive consumer clinics to understand what's going to be important.

I think you'll see at every aspect of the vehicle we're looking to improve and then the scale that we'll be able to get across platforms, I think, it's going to drive it.

 

The battery cost will be another.

And then, you mentioned it, but on top of that will be the services and that revenue that you don't get until you sell a vehicle.

 

So we are working on that plan quite aggressively.

Great.

Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.

 



Rod Lache

Hi everybody.

 

Can you hear me?



Mary Barra

Yeah.

 

Hi, Rod.



Paul Jacobson

And good morning, Rod.

 



Rod Lache

Hi.

 

Good morning.

I was hoping just first, you can help us a little bit more with some thoughts on 2022.

 

I know it's still early.

We know some of the big items.

 

You're going to have volume upside on the positive side and it's been, like, a $10 billion headwind volume for you over the course of '19 with the strike, and '20 and '21 with these shortages.

That's going to be offset by some headwind from raw materials you're spending on EVs and some reversion of GM Financial, but can you provide some high-level brackets on how we should be thinking about that?

 

In particular, the volume, the raws and the spending because it sounds like you still believe that a path to 10% margin in North America is plausible?



Paul Jacobson

Yeah.

 

I'll start with that, Rod and Mary can add in any additional however she wants to give, obviously.

I think we certainly do still see that path.

 

I think you outlined the big moving pieces in your question itself.

We're certainly going to see it lift in volume.

 

I think we're going to see a very different mix because the incremental volume that will be coming on, will be coming on at a little bit lower of a contribution than what we've seen given some of the prioritization actions we took this year.

Going forward, we do have that commodity inflation, but we still remain convicted about our ability to be able to offset either that through productivity or through some of the pricing actions that we've seen.

 

Certainly we've seen the chips impact, trim mixes, and other things that we would otherwise want to be doing but we've had to reduce a little bit.

So I think we're certainly looking at next year right now in detail, and we'll have more color to provide as we get into early 2022.

 



Rod Lache

Okay.

 

But you can't provide any kind of high-level brackets around magnitude of maybe commodity just based on where spot prices are or what is plausible for volume or spending?



Paul Jacobson

Well, I think we said earlier this year, that we expected the bulk of the commodity inflation to occur in the first half of the year.

 

Everything is moving around, obviously, as we've seen, a lot of volatility in broadly commodities and the supply chain.

We've seen a little bit of that retraced from the highs of this summer.

 

So we're triangulating around that, but we've seen a couple of billion dollars as we look at 2022, right now.

But that could go either way, based on the volatility we've seen.

 

So that's why I'm hesitant to anchor on it right now.

We're certainly looking at macro trends and that's part of the process and we'll provide more detail as we go through our budget plans.

 



Rod Lache

Okay.

 

Thanks.

And just second, there is a little bit of confusion this morning about the drivers in Q4 versus Q3.

 

So I was hoping maybe you can elaborate a little bit on that.

In the third quarter, ex the reimbursement, it looks like EBIT would've been about 2.2 billion and it looks like your guidance if you hit the high end of the range would be around 2.1 in Q4, but it sounds like you've got a fair amount of WIP inventory now, so volumes should be up quite a bit.

 

Maybe there's some adjustment you've got in GMF and you said some mix in commodities.

But can you maybe talk a little bit to some of the magnitude of those sequential moving parts?

 



Paul Jacobson

Yes.

 

So if you look at the wholesale numbers that we articulated, you'd see a pretty sizable jump from Q3 to Q4 included in that is clearing out some of the build shy going forward.

But when you look at -- sequentially in terms of costs, you've got some seasonality in the fixed costs there.

 

You've got investments in the future, particularly around some of the manufacturing plants, marketing-related to the new campaigns and the new vehicle launches going forward, and just general investment in engineering and growth across the board.

That's putting on some of the cost pressure going forward, but that is the type of long-term decisions that Mary has mentioned where we're staying focused on as we go through this.

 



Rod Lache

Okay.

 

All right.

Thank you.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.

 



Joseph Spak

Thanks.

 

Good morning.

Paul, maybe just to follow-up here, if we look at this third quarter, and we back out the 2 items from the LG reimbursement and also the cost then you had -- it looks like about a $2.2 billion headwind in costs.

 

You just went through commodities, investments.

I think there's also a non repeat to some of the [austerity] (ph) but can you help us bucket some of that a little bit, just so we can better think about how those should trend going forward.

 



Paul Jacobson

Thanks, Jodi.

 

Excuse me, to clarify you're talking about Q2 to Q3 sequentially?



Joseph Spak

Sorry, no.

 

In the third quarter on a year-over-year.

Your cost?

 



Paul Jacobson

Yeah.

 



Joseph Spak

Yeah.

 

If you look at your cost and you back out the recall and the reimbursement, it was a good $2.2 billion headwind.

So I'm trying to understand what made that up?

 



Paul Jacobson

I would say, as a general rule, I would put about half of that into commodities inflation, and about half of that into growth investments going forward.

 

And then what we've seen in our fixed cost structure.



Joseph Spak

Okay, that's helpful.

 

And then just on the CAPEX, I know you said you lowered it.

Some of that is efficiency, some of that sounds like timing.

 

If we go back to your Investor event, I think you said about nine to 10 billion over the mid-term.

So was that -- should we think about maybe towards the higher end or maybe even a little bit above next year, given some of these timing issues?

 



Paul Jacobson

Yeah.

 

I would just stick with that 9 to 10 guidance, because things bounce around from time-to-time, but I think the important thing to take away from this update is that everything is progressing on schedule and on target, and that's -- that's the biggest concern.

So timing between the year will move, sometimes it moves for you, sometimes it moves against you.

 

But what we're really tracking on is the efficiency of the investment which has gotten better, as well as the timing to make sure that we're hitting our longer-term goals, and that remains consistent.

So I would just stay with the 9 to 10.

 



Joseph Spak

Okay.

 

Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.

 



Brian Johnson

Good morning, GM Team.

 

I want to go back to some of the unanswered questions from C&D.

Probably the biggest one we've been getting is, all sounds good, but what about the capital markets?

 

In particular whether you need time in the capital markets where billions are being devoted to pre -revenue companies.

So if you think of Cruise in that light, how do you think about the tension between waiting for some commercial milestones on that, and, for example, particularly another Softbank investment if they're paying triggers that versus taking advantage of capital market conditions now?

 

And then for the rest of the portfolio, what's the metrics you're looking about when it's time, if ever, to take at least part of those out for the public markets?



Mary Barra

From a Cruise perspective, we have Cruise well funded.

 

So we're executing aggressively to commercialization and we have the ability to do that with the steps we've already taken, as well as with GM's involvement.

And I think, what you need to really look at though with Cruise, is the vertical integration with GM is a key differentiator, and I believe it's one of the reasons Cruise is so well positioned as the only person who's got the permit in San Francisco to actually take the driver out of the vehicle.

 

That seamless integration of the technology along with leveraging Ultium, as well as our manufacturing capability are a huge value.

So I think the message on Cruise is we're well funded and we have rapid commercialization plans in front of u s, and that's the play we're executing.

 

And over the longer term the board will look at what best enhances the overall value creation and shareholder value for the gf shareholder.



Brian Johnson

Well, and specifically, it seemed like Dan's pay was tied to an eventual public offering.

 

A, is that a [Indiscernible], B, does that imply to a question of when as opposed to if, at least there's a partial offering in place?



Mary Barra

I would say that the board has flexibility with the way the agreements were written to do the right thing for the GM shareholder over the long term.

 



Brian Johnson

Okay.

 

And some of the other things in Pam's portfolio would the idea be to hit commercialization targets or some of them less tied to the core of light vehicle business, e.g the fuel-cell business, and might be you could consider strategic actions earlier on those?



Mary Barra

Again, we'll evaluate each one for what we think creates the most shareholder value from a fuel cell perspective.

 

Clearly, there's a vehicle application as well as across many different transportation industries and even stationary power.

So we remain open to structure those in a way that's going to drive the most value.

 



Brian Johnson

Okay, thanks.

 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Itay McAuley with Citi.

 



Itay Michaeli

Great.

 

Thank you.

Good morning, everybody.

 

Just two questions from me, one short-term, one longer-term.

On the short-term, maybe going back to the second-half bridge, I think Paul, last quarter, you outlined about a 1.5-2 billion increasing commodity costs, H2 versus H1, and 0.5 billion of investments in growth.

 

Are those still the right number to think about?

And do you have a rough split of how that might trend from Q3 to Q4?

 



Paul Jacobson

Yeah.

 

Itay, thanks for that question.

What I would say, is it's still largely consistent, but it's really trending with volumes.

 

So I would expect that more of that inflation is going to hit in Q4 than it did in Q3, just sequentially, but that's really because of the volume lift that we see quarter-to-quarter.



Itay Michaeli

Got it.

 

That's helpful.

But just on a longer-term basis, I think one of the interesting takeaways on the 2030 revenue target is that you have 90 billion of EV revenue and only maybe a loss of 12 or 13 billion of ICE revenue.

 

So that kind of implies a pretty healthy market share gains there for the EV business.

Maybe talk more -- unpack that more for us around what's driving these implied share gains and is a 90 billion potentially include new regions, new markets that you don't really operate in today, or other types of agreements.

 

Just love to get a little more detail on that split.



Mary Barra

So the way I would look at it is that the forecast that we put together and the plans that underlie at our -- for our current markets.

 

So I would say if we enter into other markets in a broader fashion, that growth on top of that.

That's the way I would look at the EV margins.

 

And again, I think it relates to the fact that how quickly we're going to have a full portfolio of vehicles across brands serving value customers, luxury customers, performance customers with our 4 brands.



Itay Michaeli

Got it.

 

That's helpful.

Thank you.

 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo.

 



Colin Langan

Great.

 

Thanks for taking my questions.

Just wanted to follow up on the magnesium and aluminum question.

 

I guess one, how much visibility do you have?

Coming from the semi issue, there hasn't been much visibility.

 

Is aluminum -- because it's such a big, bulky item that you actually have pretty good line of sight to where your suppliers are getting their aluminum and sourcing the magnesium, which makes everything a little more complicated?

And then, what about international, is there a risk there after those operations?

 

It seems like magnesium is such a large part of global supply.



Mary Barra

Let's say, as it relates specifically to China with our JVs, we're working with our partners in the supply base to closely monitor the situation and we will take mitigation actions as required.

 

Obviously, we're working closely with the suppliers from North America perspective as well.

So our current view again with all of those conversations, is that we aren't going to see a significant supply risk.

 



Colin Langan

Got it.

 

Okay.

And then just looking at slide 13 and the GM international profits ex China have been pretty weak.

 

Is additional restructuring needed in those regions in any color?

Now that it's all lumped together, how much is South America, Korea, and I guess there's a bit rest of the world still in there?

 



Mary Barra

Yes, go ahead.

 



Paul Jacobson

I'll take that one, Colin.

 

So what I would say is that you're seeing particularly in the third quarter in GMI performance, excluding China, has a lot to do with the way the chips have been allocated.

So if you look at the market share, particularly in South America, it's been pretty low and near historic lows, I would say.

 

But as you look at sequentially through the quarter and certainly what we're seeing in October, as we've been able to turn plants back on, that market share is recovering quickly.

So I don't think the results that you're seeing ex-China is indicative of the run-rate capability of the performance.

 

In fact, I think it's a testament to the restructuring efforts that have been done and we would look for further improvement in those regions as volume returns back to normal levels.



Colin Langan

Okay.

 

All right, thanks for taking my questions.



Paul Jacobson

Thank you.

 



Mary Barra

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives with Wedbush.

 



Daniel Ives

Yeah, thanks.

 

So my question, it's not focused on next 30 or 45 days, like some, but when you're looking at the EV vision into 2022, can you walk us through the key bogeys?

Obviously, it starts off with CES, but what are shorter the -- what we would view as almost the timeline and the key events going into '22, when we think about EV?

 



Mary Barra

So I think it really starts at the end of fall this year with the Hummer EV followed by the Lyriq in launching in both United States and in China.

 

Then we'll -- as you said at CES, we're going to be revealing the Silverado EV and this is really a redefinition and taking trucks to I'll say a new level based on what we can do with the Ultium and platform and understanding what truck owners want, but also people who are coming in who aren't our traditional truck buyers.

At CES will also share a little bit more detail about the $30,000 Chevy EV that will then be revealed later in the year.

 

And we'll have more to say with the vehicle that's even going to be more affordable than that.

And again, we have a number of EVs as we've talked about, 30 by 25, so there'll be more information.

 

But those are, what I can share with you now.

So some pretty significant milestones of not only having EVs out, we will also, as we take care of our customers with the Bolt EV and EUV, we will have an opportunity to really grow that share because the vehicle was doing quite well before we took the necessary actions to protect our customers.

 

So I see a very strong EV landscape in '22, but then in '23, it really turns on.

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.

 



Adam Jonas

Thanks everybody.

 

Hi, Mary.

So Mary, you've talked about taking driver out of Cruise vehicles in quarters, not years.

 

How confident does GM feel driver out can be achieved in 2022?

Is that too soon?

 



Mary Barra

I --

 



Adam Jonas

I know you're close.

 



Mary Barra

-- I would say we're pretty confident.

 



Adam Jonas

Okay.

 

That's good enough for me.

Mary, just a follow-up on car rental and fleet support, with the -- as your cars become more connected and software designed, OEMs are moving into it like yourselves are moving into this recurring revenue network operating model.

 

You see that VW bought Europcar, Tesla does a major deal with a car rental firm.

I'm just wondering what your 2030 targets are heavily based on software and service revenue, which implies some degree of physical fleet management.

 

So what is GM's strategy for fleet support?

You thinking

 



Adam Jonas

more in-house and vertically integrated, you work with the franchise dealers, are there other alternatives like working with non-dealer partners like car rental or other logistics partners along the way?

 

Thanks.



Mary Barra

Sure.

 

Well, I think if you look at how we're structuring BrightDrop from a commercial vehicle perspective, and some of the close relationships that we have with FedEx Express, etc, we as a part of BrightDrop are going to have a system that holistically helps them manage the whole ecosystem.

I think that points in a direction.

 

Having said that though, with the launch of EVs, I think, and the software services ran on the vehicle, we're not going to seed that to someone



Mary Barra

else because I think that revenue and managing that is very important.

 

And none of it starts to accrue until you actually have the vehicle being driven.

But having said that, I will just say, and there's a lot of conversations going on right now and again, we're going to look at what provides us the biggest growth opportunity, not only in EV sales, but also in the whole software system to manage those fleets or provide different services to our customers.

 

So I don't have anything specific to announce today, but I can just say there's a lot of conversations underway.



Adam Jonas

Thanks, Mary.

 



Mary Barra

Sure.

 

Thanks, Adam.

Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.

 



John Murphy

Good morning everybody.

 

I wanted to ask about inventory management here in the short run midterm and long term, I think Paul, you had mentioned this about 124,000 units in dealer inventory right now to some units in work in progress.

If you can let us know what that number is.

 

Then also, for both of you, where you think that travel levels should be in the U.S.

as things normalize because pre -crisis you've been running right around 800,000 units plus or minus.

 

So it indicates that there can be very significant catch-up.

But I guess the question is, where do you actually land and how much of the price activity that has been really positive to the tight inventory might be maintained?

 

So short-term, what are we actually looking at of effective inventory?

And then long-term, where do you think it stays?

 

Hopefully tighter than history, and what does that mean for pricing?



Paul Jacobson

Good morning, John.

 

What I would say is that the inventory levels that we've seen now around that 125,000 is expected to remain low, probably into and through 2022, to be honest.

I think as production ramps up in terms of what we're seeing in demand, I think the opportunities to build inventory are going to be somewhat limited, which in the short run I think is a good thing for pricing and for what we see in terms of the demand environment.

 

Mid-term, we would expect to start building inventories off of these levels because it's not healthy where we see our dealers with empty lots, etc, and when consumers want to buy a vehicle, they want to buy a vehicle, they don't want to wait.

We're meant to have more inventory.

 

And longer-term, what I would say is, go back to what we've said from the beginning of this, that there's a lot of lessons learned in inventory management and certainly what the impact has been on pricing this year, and the right answer is certainly a lot more than what we have today, but certainly quite a bit less than what we've carried historically going forward.

So as we come through this over the longer term, we'll continue to manage that dynamically through the market.

 

But I expect it to be less than historical levels.



John Murphy

I'm sorry.

 



Mary Barra

Go ahead.

 



John Murphy

No Mary, go ahead.

 

I'll just follow-up after that.



Mary Barra

I just -- fall spot on, the only thing I would add is we've added a lot of data analytics to better support our dealers to have the right inventory.

 

And so I think, like Paul said, you're going to see something less but I think it's going to be much more efficient from a Company and a dealer perspective.

I'm really pleased with how well that's working out with our dealers as we look at getting the right products, spec the right way to really serve the customer efficiently.

 



John Murphy

That's incredibly helpful.

 

And then just one question on the Cadillac ULA strategy.

It sounds like there was a charge in the quarter as you're transitioning some of the dealerships out, as they don't want to tag into or invest in the new EV strategy.

 

I'm just curious how big that is in the base of Cadillac dealerships?

And if you think about the transition to EV in your entire product portfolio, how big an opportunity is this to maybe streamline and strengthen your dealership base on a stronger core, like you have in other parts of the business?

 



Mary Barra

Yes.

 

I think what has been accomplished with the Cadillac dealer base is very, very important and it was done the right way.

We were clear with, as we transition Cadillac, it will be our lead brand moving into all EV, and wanted to make sure that the dealers were in partnership with us to make the investments that they needed to make to -- when selling electric vehicles.

 

And for those -- and we have a lot of dealers, some are very high-volume, some are smaller.

So you can imagine if they weigh that decision of what's in the best interest for them, we worked through that.

 

So what we have now, I think, is a very efficient Cadillac dealer base that's very excited about all EV products that are coming and are making the investments to support the customer extremely well, so I think it's going to be a model as we go forward, but I'm very pleased with how that is turned out.

Again, we did it in with our dealers and I think that's going prove to be the right way to do it and very strong from a customer support perspective.

The next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.

 



Emmanuel Rosner

Thank you.

 

Good morning, everybody.



Mary Barra

Morning.

 



Paul Jacobson

Morning Emmanuel

 



Emmanuel Rosner

So 1 follow-up on the short-term and then 1 longer term question.

 

On the short-term, I'm curious if you could put a finer points around how some of the cost pressure you expect in the fourth quarter, are good read across the run rate for how to think about 2022.

And the reason I'm asking is if I understand you well, Paul, I think you expect Q4 volumes to be about in line with Q2, but then at the same time, the guided EBITDA for Q4 is probably about half of what you did in Q2.

 

So 3 billion versus the 4 billion.

And so when I think over that $2 billion delta seems like there's commodities in there and then there's investments in the future.

 

So first is my understanding correct,and second of all, how do I think about these costs going into next year?

You spoke about commodities, what about investments in the future?

 

Is this the run rate that is required for your plan?



Paul Jacobson

Yes.

 

So thanks, Emmanuel, for that question.

In order to go back to Q2, we also have to understand that there were some one-time or shorter term impact issues that were affecting that.

 

So when you back that out of Q2 and normalize it, you are looking at approximately a billion dollars.

So GMF had true-up of some of its liabilities.

 

Now that all that caught up to the credit terms and the used car prices were in a run rate basis at GMF that was included in Q2.

We had some mark-to-market on investments as well.

 

So if you take about a billion out and then you look at roughly a billion to a billion and a half where we were, Q4 to Q2, I would break that down into about half of that.

So call it in the $700 million range being about the cost inflation and where we're seeing investment into the business on, kind of, a run rate?

 

And then, the other half being commodities, which should vary over time.

And certainly we've seen some of that pressure coming off of the peaks.

 

Hope that answered your question.



Emmanuel Rosner

That's super-clear, but the fourth-quarter, how do we think about these investments in the business on a go-forward basis?

 



Paul Jacobson

And I think the fourth quarter is indicative of that.

 

You see that fixed cost being roughly flat 3Q to 4Q was how we're thinking about it.

But it's going to continue to grow over time as we roll-out these products and going forward.

 

So you've seen some increase in CIB for the launches of the new EVs.

Obviously, we are going to be in a pretty sizable launch cadence going forward for the next few years.

 

And we're going to make sure that we invest in that and then we've got engineering going on for multiple projects going forward.

So I think we've got good control of that where we stand and where we go.

 

And it's stuff that we think is the right investment for the long term.



Emmanuel Rosner

Great.

 

And then on the longer term you -- I wanted to follow up on the question I asked here on the Capital Markets Day.

We're very encouraged -- I was very encouraged to see your bullish long-term targets for margin, as well as the goals to improve margins in the core automotive business by 2030.

 

My question is, how will you manage profitability in between, so between now and mid - decade, as some of these EVs roll on and ramp up at lower than average margin, as well as like some of these investments in the business as needed?

How will you ensure that the profitability is on the upward trajectory before that 2030 target?

 



Mary Barra

Yes.

 

Emmanuel, here's the way I look at it.

Obviously, as we get scale, that's going to continue to help the question that was asked before from an EV profitability perspective, so that -- we get there mid-decade and then just continue to build on that.

 

But we are also going to be focused on investing in businesses that are going to allow us to create software businesses that have a very different margin potential overall, that's part of that.

So, as we said at Investor Day, we said we -- plus or minus, we're going to maintain margins as we go forward because we think we have the capability to do that.

 

But just to be clear, we're also going to make sure that we're doing the right investment.

We're not going to constrain investment in the future growth opportunities.

 

But the current modeling that we've done and the plan that we're executing and the targets that have been distributed that everybody is being held accountable to, we see roughly a steady and then improving towards the latter part of the decade with margins.

Paul, anything to divest?

 



Paul Jacobson

No.

 

And I think, the additional truck capacity that's coming on is going to give us an ability to continue to grow the leading truck franchise, which, as we've said from day 1, is funding the journey.

So we expect a little bit of mix uplift from that, that's going to help to offset some of that shorter-term margin pressure that you might otherwise expect to see.

 

So this is going to be a focal point of -- as I talked about in my prepared remarks, of making sure that we're bringing transparency on KBIs and how we're thinking about the business heading through '22 and into 2023.



Emmanuel Rosner

That's great [Indiscernible].

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.

 



Ryan Brinkman

Hi.

 

Thanks for taking my question, which is on how you are anticipating commercial negotiations with Autoparts suppliers, [Indiscernible], going forward and the potential impact -to - margin.

I understand they're typically built into contracts, agreements for automakers to compensate suppliers for increases in raw material costs, but generally not for other forms of inflation such as freight, logistics, labor, etc.

 

On some of the earnings calls so far this quarter, suppliers have discussed attempting to negotiate for reimbursement for some of these, at least non-commodity supply chain costs and even for the magnitude and suddenness of order cancellations due to the semiconductor shortage curtailing production, which again, I don't think we've historically seen automakers compensate suppliers for lower volumes coming from factors outside of their control.

So I just wanted to check in with you to see how you expect these conversations may proceed and whether we should think about suppliers bearing the brunt of these non-commodity costs, or if there may be margin implications for GM?

 



Paul Jacobson

Ryan, I'll take a shot at that, and obviously not going to go into any detail on any conversations that we're having across our supply base.

 

But what I would say is, the singular focus is making sure that we have consistency and reduce some of the volatility that we've seen in the supply chain, whether it's due to logistics or semiconductors, etc.

So we're working across-the-board because that's where the real value is, working with our suppliers to drive efficiencies across the business, as ultimately what we all have to do to be able to counter inflationary aspects of the business.

 

But right now the here and now is navigating through some of the short-term challenges while focusing on operations.



Ryan Brinkman

Thanks.

 

That's helpful.

And then my last question is a follow-up to Adam's earlier question on fleet sales.

 

I recall that pre -pandemic you had significantly reduced your sales to daily rental card companies in particular.

How are you feeling -- thinking about prioritizing of sales between retail and fleet customers and between the various categories of fleet customers with the supply chain where it is currently?

 

And then longer-term, how do you view the relative attractiveness in profitability of the various different sales channels, such as retail, daily rental, commercial, small and medium-sized businesses, etc.?



Mary Barra

Well, yes.

 

In the past, in the traditional ICE business, daily rental was the least profitable business and we had worked to reduce that substantially and held discipline to that.

They are actually though, as fleet businesses, very good as I mentioned before with what we're entering in to BrightDrop.

 

Not only the business itself with the vehicles, but then the services and the first mile-last mile solutions that we're going to be offering, so we're going to be aggressive from that perspective and then again, I think there's new frameworks opening up from what today or what has been in the past from a rental car perspective.

As I said, there's a lot of conversations going on.

 

We're going to do what we think is in the long-term interest of maximizing our profitability and also reach with EVs, and so more to come.



Ryan Brinkman

Great.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.

 



Mark Delaney

Good morning and thanks very much for taking my questions.

 

Software connected services, especially on a subscription basis, is a big focus for the auto industry is something that GM spend a lot of time focusing on at the Analyst Day.

I think the Company guided for about 2 billion of subscription-related revenue this year, over 70 % EBITDA margin.

 

And you talked about that 20 billion to 25 billion target by 2030.

Can you -- can you talk about how you see the ramp from where you are this year to that 2030 target?

 

What sort of increases should we be expecting as investors in the next few years?

And is it a pretty linear increase or is it just going to be more of a backend weighted target?

 



Paul Jacobson

Hi, good morning Mark.

 

As we talked about, a lot of that revenue growth is really tied to the Ultifi platform and how we're going forward in terms of getting the connected car park out there, which is going to build aggressively over time as we ramp up EVs.

So by definition that's going to be a little bit more back-loaded.

 

We still -- we can see a little bit of growth on the horizon as we look at OnStar and some of the connected services which is really the baseline today going forward, but certainly we'd expect that to tick up as we -- significantly in the growth rate as we get into the second half of the decade.



Mark Delaney

Understood.

 

And my follow-up question is about end demand.

Wholesales were down and, I think, a lot of it is on the supply chain challenges.

 

But when you look at some of the macroeconomic indicators and talk to your channel and dealer network, are you seeing any changes in end demand either in the U.S.

or China that we need to be monitoring?

 

Or is the wholesale decline really just due to supply?

Thanks.

 



Mary Barra

Where selling everything we can sell.

 

It is totally due to what we are able to supply.

I'm so excited and enthused at the strong reaction to all of our products.

 

So I am confident as we build more, we will have -- we'll see strong reaction and acceptance of those vehicles.



Mark Delaney

Thank you.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Matt Portillo with Tudor Pickering Holt.

 



Matt Portillo

Good morning.

 

And thank you for taking my questions.

I wanted to ask a follow-up question on the BrightDrop business segment.

 

The long-term revenue growth outlook provided at CMD was quite impressive backed by initial custom orders from FedEx and Verizon.

What we're hoping to get a bit more color on is how you're seeing incremental customer demand evolving given benefits highlighted on our TCO basis for buyers, and how we should think about margin progression for the business as vehicle production ramps over the next few years and accelerate revenue streams expand, helping to push margins to the low 20s long-term.

 



Mary Barra

Yes.

 

Matt, I think we shared quite a bit of information on our goals there.

As Paul said, as we move forward in the next few months, we'll give you milestones to look at in some of those key businesses like BrightDrop, but I don't have anything more to share today.

 



Matt Portillo

Okay.

 

Thank you.

And then my follow-up question.

 

I was just hoping to dig a bit around the medium-term outlook for Ultra Cruise, it's an extremely exciting platform.

We know Supercruise is currently being rolled out to a wider range of models this year and scaling to 22 vehicles by 2023.

 

Just curious if you could provide some guide rails and how we should be thinking about the roll-out of Ultra Cruise and at what point we could see that product launched in some of your higher volume vehicle lines?



Mary Barra

With all the lessons learned that we've had with Super Cruise that as we get that technology on retail market, that we will scale it quite or make it available quite rapidly across the portfolio even faster than what we've done with Super Cruise.

 



Matt Portillo

Thank you.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

I would now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks.



Mary Barra

Great.

 

Well, hey, thanks, everybody for all of your questions.

I do want to end with saying how proud I am of the entire GM team, including our dealers and our suppliers.

 

In every part of the Company, I see urgency, decisiveness, agility, creativity of just solving issues and finding opportunities and really leveraging them.

So they are key --.our partners are key to our consistent strong performance over the last several years.

 

And it's why I'm very confident not only that we're going to see improvements as we move through fourth quarter and into 2022, and then beyond.

We are very committed to the growth strategy that we outlined as part of our Investor Day and looking forward to sharing more, not only about the exciting products and businesses that we'll be offering, but also the milestones for you to be able to track our performance.

 

So again, I thank you for joining us today and I hope everyone stays safe.
Operator

That concludes our conference call for today.

 

Thank you for joining.

You may now disconnect.

Lars Moravy



Vice President of Vehicle Engineering



Martin Viecha 

Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Tesla 's Third Quarter 2021 Q&A webcast.

 

My name is Martin Viecha, Senior Director of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by our CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn, and our Senior VP, Drew Baglino, as well as other executives.

Our Q3 results were announced at about 3 p.m.

 

Central Time in the Update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.

During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.

 

These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.

Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.

 

During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.

[Operator Instructions] But before we jump into the Q&A, Zach has some opening remarks.

 

Zach?



Zachary Kirkhorn 

Yeah.

 

Thanks, Martin.

We're continuing to make great progress as a Company, setting new records on each of the most important financial metrics for Q3.

 

Overall, we delivered just over 240,000 cars, 20% higher than last quarter, and 70% higher than the same quarter last year.

We were also able to achieve an annualized production run rate of over 1 million cars towards the end of the quarter.

 

The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at our Shanghai factory.

Additionally, we have made great progress, increasing production volumes of Model S, and have recently started to ramp and deliveries of Model X.

 

It will take a bit more time to get this program back to prior volumes.

But based on demand, we're targeting to exceed historical production levels.

 

We've also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export hub.

This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and to introduce Model Y to Europe.

 

Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at full capacity.

It's important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally difficult to achieve.

 

I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production teams for showing impressive flexibility as we make adjustments real-time.

These teams' expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference in managing through these challenges.

 

Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast with our suppliers as we're adding capacity as quickly as possible.

I also want to thank our suppliers for the dedication and partnership to Tesla.

 

Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average customer wait times are extending.

The only practical way to address this in the immediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our existing production lines, which is where we are focused.

 

Similar dynamics are also playing out in our storage business as we are working to expand Powerwall and Megapack production as quickly as parts themselves allow us to do so.

Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program.

 

And we're excited to have expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.

Financially, our auto gross margins reached 30.5% on a GAAP basis and just under 29%, excluding regulatory credits, which was our strongest yet.

 

This benefit primarily comes from higher volumes, particularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the Model Y as we -- and we have made good progress increasing Model S volumes.

The Model S has now returned to positive gross margin and we expect this to increase with higher production and the ramp of Model X.

 

As was the case in Q2, there were some net benefit from pricing actions.

However, this remains small in the context of other contributors.

 

Please keep in mind that given backlog, it will take time for the impact of recent changes to flow through our financials.

Note that we are also not yet recognizing additional revenue from the FSD Beta program.

 

Supply chain challenges, including expedites, continue to provide cost headwinds, as was also the case with FX this quarter.

While we are seeing an impact from the rise in commodity and labor costs, we have also been adjusting pricing, which should help to compensate.

 

Overall, as I mentioned in our last call, our P&L continues to benefit from the marginal profitability of each incremental unit with higher fixed cost absorption.

As a result of the great progress on margins, volume, and appropriate management of overhead costs, we were able to achieve an operating margin of just under 15%, exceeding the long-term guidance we've laid out previously.

 

On cash, we generated record operating cash flows of $3.1 billion and continued to invest heavily in the build-out of manufacturing, supercharging, and service capacity.

We also continue to retire high interest rate debt, including the early settlement of our 2025 senior notes of $1.8 billion during the quarter.

 

As we look forward, we're clearly quite a bit ahead of the pacing required to achieve our target annual growth rate of 50% this year.

Q4 production will depend heavily on availability of parts, but we are driving for continued growth.

 

We are also nearing assembly of our first-production cars in Austin and Berlin.

It's important to stress, while the first production car is an important milestone, the hardest work lies ahead in the ramp.

 

Please keep in mind that we are pushing the boundaries on new product and manufacturing technologies at these factories, which makes it difficult to predict the exact pace of the ramp.

These factories will also partially lay on our margins as we work towards volume production.

 

Overall, I am very proud of what the team has accomplished, and I'm excited for our next phase of growth into Q4 and into 2022.

The team has done a tremendous job improving our financial health in a short period of time, while also continuing to improve our precision and pace of execution.

 

Thank you.



Martin Viecha 

Thank you very much.

 

And we will now take questions from institutional and retail shareholders that we posted on our website.

The first question is, when should we expect the first vehicles to be delivered with 4680 cells?

 



Zachary Kirkhorn 

Yes, thanks, Martin.

 

Earlier next year, from a non-cell perspective, structural battery crash, range, and reliability testing are on track to be complete this quarter.

Testing to-date has gone well, and the Fremont manufacturing line is on track to support.

 

However, similar to what Zach said before, this is a new architecture, and unknown unknowns may exist still.

Our top priority is ensuring quality in what we deliver.

 

And from a cell perspective, we are comfortable with the design maturity and manufacturing readiness, matching the pack timeline I just mentioned.



Martin Viecha 

Thank you very much.

 

The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $25,000 model in 2023.

What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?

 



Lars Moravy 

Yeah, we're working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.

 

I think Zach spoke to that well.

And we're doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.

 

We don't want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we're generally in a cell constrained world.

While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and Berlin, ramping S&X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing 3 and Y production in Fremont and Shanghai.

 

As we've mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.

And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the table.

 



Martin Viecha 

Thank you very much.

 

The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?



Lars Moravy 

At this point, it's not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we've collected.

 

This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.

In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.

 

If for instance, say the training, and that takes one day instead of one week, makes a huge difference in our ability to push out more updates.

But realistically, there's a whole lot more that comes into play when iterating software updates.

 

The whole infrastructure from top to bottom, including testing and validation, needs to be set up for faster iteration.

So daily updates are not really realistic for now.

 



Martin Viecha 

Thank you very much.

 

The next question is, ""Can you provide an update on future model development and how much diversity in your fleet will be necessary to achieve 20 million in annual volumes?

The best-selling cars in the world today only sell slightly over 1 million units, so is it possible to achieve 20 million units with just S, X, 3, Y, truck and the $25,000 car?""

 



Lars Moravy 

Thanks, Martin.

 

As we've mentioned before, we've seen record growth of both Model 3 and Model Y segments, where Model 3 is currently the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.

As we mentioned at our shareholder's meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.

 

Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.

As we've said publicly, we'll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.

 

Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.



Martin Viecha 

Thank you very much.

 

The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla 's goal for vehicle production capacity for the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by 2024?



Zachary Kirkhorn 

Yeah.

 

Thanks, Martin.

Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of 50% per year.

 

And so, you can extrapolate that out.

There may be some periods of time in which we're well ahead of that.

 

There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we're slightly lower than that.

But that remains the long-term goal of the Company.

 

In Fremont, we're continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible there.

Over the last 12 months, we've done about 430,000 cars of production.

 

And based upon everything that we know in the factory where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we’re targeting to increase that another 50%.

I think that will be a difficult goal, but that's the goal that the internal team has.

 

And they're going to continue to push on that.

As we look towards Shanghai, we're continuing to push the boundaries there, and we continue to ramp production there as well.

 

So most recently, the ramp up to Model Y, which was our biggest contributor of volume in Q3.

We'll continue to ramp that factory.

 

And in our plans, there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.

Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y.

 

But we've intentionally set these factories and locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and ability to expand.

And so, we'll take Model Y at these factories.

 

We're trying to get to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can.

And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories.

 

And then we will add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there.

So, our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years.

 

And then ultimately in the long term, be able to achieve 20 million cars per year.

We're going to grow as quickly as is feasibly possible with an eye towards a 50% annual growth rate.

 



Martin Viecha 

Great.

 

Thank you very much.

The next question is, what is your view on the tightening regulatory environment for FSD in the investigation and broad data request by NHTSA?

 

Some of the recent nominees to NHTSA have been publicly critical of FSD, including engaging with short-sellers online.

How will you manage these environments?

 



Lars Moravy 

Thanks, Martin.

 

As we have been for years, we always engage with NHTSA and other worldwide regulatory bodies to share our knowledge and to work with them on our approaches on both active and passive safety.

There are ongoing regulatory inquiries taking place all the time, and especially on the subjects.

 

FSD, they're at the cutting edge of technology development.

During these investigations, my team, myself, are always cooperative as much as possible.

 

We expect to embrace the scrutiny of these products and know that the truth about their performance and the innovations our products have will ultimately be all that matters.

In the end then and as I've said on previous calls, we take safety as a top priority in all our designs.

 

This is because our primary motivation is coming from a team of incredible engineers designing software and hardware that saves lives and prevents injuries.

And doing so, we'll continue to be transparent to the public on how our technology is both developing from an autopilot safety data, the latest of which we just shared in the shareholder update.

 

And you can also see in review a wide variety of customer post, FSD videos on social media.



Zachary Kirkhorn 

Just to add to that, I mean, as Lars said, safety is extremely important for Tesla.

 

It's the right thing to do.

And if you look at various independent testing and regulatory testing of our products, you can see the work of incredibly talented engineers in the results of those tests.

 

And our goal in developing safety-oriented software around the car is to continue to go beyond what the hardware is able to provide.

If you can prevent a crash from happening, that's the safest way to manage this.

 

And I think at a macro level here, what we're seeing, and this is entirely understandable and expected is that the automotive industry is going through a transition from the traditional car as we know, it to more computer software-oriented sensor suites around them that can manage things beyond just what the driver manages.

And in regulatory bodies are understandably so are interested in understanding how to regulate in this environment.

 

And this has no exception to that.

So as Lars mentioned here, I think this is a great thing.

 

We're excited to partner.

And we'll work collaboratively with all regulatory bodies who want to go on that journey to the transition to a software-oriented vehicle.

 



Martin Viecha 

Thank you very much.

 

The next question is, service remains an issue with appointments available weeks or even months out.

Likewise, supercharger wait out has become untenable at some locations.

 

What concrete steps is Tesla taking to improve the customer experience in these two key areas?



Zachary Kirkhorn 

I will take the service part of this question.

 

Drew, you can take the supercharging part.

We have seen an increase in service late times throughout the summer, and there's a couple of things that have contributed to that based upon the information that we had.

 

The first is that I think this is not -- this is not unique to us is that the return to some sense of normalcy in a post-pandemic world has happened I think more quickly than most people expected.

And what we're seeing here is that the number of miles that people are driving has increased.

 

There may have been some demand for service during 2020 or in the early parts of 2021 that customers put off.

And so, there's a bit of a catch-up that's occurring that has increased demand for service.

 

At the same time, in the macro-environment here, logistics, moving parts, sourcing parts, has become increasingly more difficult, which is a well-known issue in the world right now, as well as challenges in the labor market.

And so, there's this simultaneous increase in demand for service, where the ability to supply that service has been impacted for the reasons I mentioned.

 

And so, we saw an uptick primarily in Europe and North America and service wait times over the course of the summer.

And we've been working extremely hard since then to address this.

 

And we've seen our wait times come down.

So, this is not the case in every location, but if you think about it from regional average perspectives, we are seeing improvements there.

 

We remain super-focused on adding locations.

And so, over the last year, we've grown our physical footprint of service centers by 35%.

 

We've grown our footprint of mobile repair by over 40%.

We're also adding staffing as quickly as we can in the areas that are most impacted by the imbalance of supply and demand for service.

 

But I think the most important part about all of this is -- and we've said this on calls before where the best service is no service.

And so, we have been incredibly focused as a Company, both on the initial quality of our vehicles and reliability of our vehicles.

 

And we've seen pretty substantially improvements in both of those metrics over the long term and over the last couple of quarters.

So, it is something that remains on our minds.

 

We monitor this very closely.

But hopefully, that's a helpful explanation into the context and what we're doing.

 



Andrew Baglino 

And on the Supercharger side, Supercharging team monitors congestion and plans expansion to ensure customer experience met with minimal wait times alongside the growth in our vehicle fleet.

 

While we certainly have work to do in an expanding capacity in some congested areas, average congestion on the network has decreased over the past 18 months.

Nonetheless, we're not standing still.

 

We are executing accelerating expansion plans globally.

The network has doubled in the last 18 months, and we are planning to triple it over the next 2 years.

 

And even so, on an individual site basis, to combat existing congestion more quickly where it is isolated and programmatic, we expedite local relief sites, deploy mobile Superchargers, and we try to introduce pricing strategies that encourage more off-peak usage to avoid the waiting.



Martin Viecha 

Thank you very much.

 



Zachary Kirkhorn 

I want just one thing to add on supercharging.

 

If you haven't experienced our latest iteration of battery packs that can handle fast charge rates in combination with our 250-watt -- kilowatt charging stations, it's pretty incredible.

And this is a really important component to supercharging capacity.

 

The faster you can charge, the more charge sessions that you can have on an individual post.

That other customer experiences as you're going on a long-term journey because you're supercharging times are lower.

 



Andrew Baglino 

Yeah.

 



Zachary Kirkhorn 

So, this is a really important part of the strategy.

 

Super charging team has done a great job rolling this out.

But it requires a combination of the 250-kilowatt charging in our latest iteration battery packs.

 



Andrew Baglino 

And we've also maintained an ongoing roadmap on software improvements, dynamic routing to avoid busy superchargers; that's actually really helpful.

 

We take the real-time busyness of the stations into account when choosing where to navigate people on their road trip.

And beyond that, we're also continuing to improve the Trip Planner itself and how it estimates how much energy people use so it's not too conservative and ask them to be able to charge more than they need to, which is another thing that can delay a total trip.

 



Martin Viecha 

Great.

 

Thank you very much.

The next question is, is Tesla considering any other ideas other than FSD with the real-world AI that can bring additional software revenue to Tesla?

 

If not, can Tesla consider building interesting games around FSD Beta?



Lars Moravy 

Sure.

 

At AI Day we did talk about potential future where Dojo could be used as a neural net training platform for other companies.

It's not a focus of ours today as we are fully subscribed on Dojo with our internal uses, we do expect to continue to improve the in-car experience in the context of FSD

 



Martin Viecha 

Great.

 

Thank you.

And maybe last question from shareholders is, how does FSD take rate -- how has FSD take rate change since the introduction of monthly subscription?

 

Are there any plans to increase the FSD pricing as why the release becomes imminent?



Zachary Kirkhorn 

I'll take the second part of the question first, we won't be providing any forward-looking commentary on our pricing strategy or what may happen here over the near term.

 

With respect to the first part of the question, it has been an interesting thing for us to impact within the Company.

What I'll say, just as a general statement before I make a couple of specific comments, is that the things that we learned on FSD subscription today are not necessarily all that relevant.

 

This is really more of a platform for when FSD Beta goes into wide release, and the features and functionality become more accessible to more customers.

The second thing that I'll note is that if you look at the pricing, the monthly pricing of FSD subscription, and then you compare that to the cost of rolling FSD option into your lease or you loan, on a monthly basis to note the economical way for a customer to enjoy the features of full self-driving is through purchasing it upfront and enrolling into their financing.

 

And as a result of that, what we've seen in the data is not -- we're unable to detect a change in the upfront take rate of FSD when people when people purchase cars.

We have seen quite a bit of activity of folks carry us to experience what the software has to offer and subscribing to it and enjoying it to that route.

 

But again, as I said at the beginning, I think what we've seen so far on FSD subscription is not terribly relevant.

We'll see how that plays out in the future as we continue to release more features.

 



Martin Viecha 

Thank you very much.

 

And now let's go to analyst questions.

[Operator Instructions].

 

The next question comes from Q - Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.

Pierre, feel free to unmute your mic and go ahead.

 

Pierre, I think your mic is muted.

Okay.

 

While Pierre works on that, let's go to the next analyst.

The next question comes from Q - Joseph Spak from RBC.

 

Joe, we cannot hear you.

Can you click unmute?

 

Okay.

While the team is working on that, let's just go back to say the questions.

 

The next set of upcoming question is, Can Tesla allow for FSD to be transferred to another vehicle at a fee, something less than 10-K?

Early adopters are paying the price if they want to upgrade their vehicle.

 

You lose the value on the trade-in, and now you have to buy in at a higher cost.



Zachary Kirkhorn 

I don't think that this is widely known but we already actually doing the sentiment of what this question is asking.

 

If you trade in your Tesla to Tesla, we -- there's a difference in price that we pay for a trade-in that has FSD compared to one that doesn't.

And so, there's -- there's that premium that we pay to repurchase the FSD.

 

That money can then be applied towards the purchase of the new car.

So, I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit, we see it on social media, we see it in the forums, etc.

 

And so, this already does exist.

And not directly in the form here.

 

And we don't call it out explicitly in the trade-in, potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in as a result.

And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.

 



Martin Viecha 

Okay.

 

The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn't happened and we know there are a lot of updates.

Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?

 



Lars Moravy 

Yeah.

 

Thanks, Martin.

We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.

 

We've been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.

As you may have seen recently on social media, we've built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to further mature the design.

 

And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.

There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial vision.

 

We'll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we're in now and look to launch that by next year.



Martin Viecha 

Okay.

 

Thank you very much.

We just promoted Pierre to a presenter here.

 



Pierre Ferragu 

Can you hear me, guys?

 



Martin Viecha 

Yes, we can hear you.

 



Pierre Ferragu 

Amazing.

 

I'm very impressed that you managed to figure that out.



Martin Viecha 

We have to.

 



Andrew Baglino 

Thank you, Pierre.

 



Pierre Ferragu 

[Indiscernible].

 

Anyway.

Let me ask my question.

 

I actually, I'm very intrigued by what you guys are doing on the insurance front, and you have now in the market index us, an insurance product for which the premium varies as a function of the safety score of the driver.

And so, I'd love to hear you about that.

 

You must have some initial data points so that market's reaction, what's the update?

And from there, can you tell us about how you think you're going to distribute that?

 

Is that going to go through your installed base very easily or is it going to be like a heavy marketing bush?

And then will you tell us about your expansion plans.

 

What are the next geographies, what's the timing, how fast is that business line likely to grow in the next few years?



Zachary Kirkhorn 

Thank you, Pierre.

 

I'm extremely passionate about our insurance product.

We have a terrific team here at Tesla of folks up who have been spending a lot of time developing this, and probably listening to the call.

 

We're pretty excited so far up here.

At the highest level here, we entered the insurance markets unintentionally, I would say.

 

Our customers were coming to us complaining that the price of traditional insurance was too high.

And it was reducing the affordability of a Tesla.

 

And part of our journey here at Tesla is we want as many people as possible to be able to afford our products.

That's extremely important to achieving the mission of the Company.

 

And if you look at the price of insurance as a percentage of what somebody's monthly payment is, it's quite high.

And we spend extreme amount of effort in manufacturing to take $5 upon cost-out here, or $10 out somewhere else.

 

If we can get $5, $10, $20, $30 out on a monthly payment, you can calculate what that means in terms of reduction of the price of the car if you finance it, and the leverage of improving insurance cost is huge in terms of affordability.

And so that's kind of the context by which we stepped into those.

 

As we started to do more research, essentially the tools by which the insurance has traditionally calculated are optimized based upon the existing data.

But the existing data is limited.

 

So, they felt there's a focus on things like marital status or age, or other attributes like that.

Accident history is a good one, etc.

 

What essentially happens here is customers who are low-risk and don't actually file many claims end up overpaying on their insurance relative to their cost.

That over payment then goes to riskier customers for essentially being subsidized.

 

And as we looked at this and we looked at the data, we thought this just doesn't seem like it's fair.

At Tesla, because our cars are connected, because they are essentially computers on wheels, there's enormous amounts of data that we have available to us to be able to assess the attributes of a driver who's operating that car, and whether those attributes correlate with safety.

 

Because we do get a signal when a car has been in an accident.

So, we've been spending our time looking at hundreds of different variables and also looking at billions of miles of driving history.

 

And we've been able to fit a model that is able to predict with decent accuracy the probability of collision over a period of time.

And the model is not perfect.

 

The model is a function of the data that we have available.

That dataset continues to grow.

 

We continue to experiment with new variables, but we do have a model that works pretty well, so far.

And from that model being able to predict frequency of collision, we can then align that against the price curve.

 

And we can have individualized pricing integrated into the car, integrated into the app, integrated into that customer's experience.

With the feedback loop back to the customer on how they are driving after every drive, the attributes that they were successful on or unsuccessful on, and the tips of things that they can do to improve their safety.

 

That's what we've developed.

We then included the safety score as part of the FSD Beta enrollment program where we have almost 150,000 cars currently using the safety score.

 

And I believe the latest data is over 100 million miles of driving.

We've been able to go back and analyze that data and we've learned 2 things coming from that.

 

The first is that the probability of collision for a customer using safety score versus not is 30% lower.

That's a pretty big difference.

 

It means that the product is working and customers are responding to it.

The second thing that we've looked at is what is the probability of collision based upon actual data as a function of a driver safety score.

 

And that is aligning with our models.

Most notably, if you're in the top tier of safety compared to lower tiers, there's multiplex difference in probability of collision based upon actual data.

 

So, this is a very new and very exciting frontier for us.

I know that was long-winded but I -- we spent a lot of time on this and we put a lot of thought into it.

 

Specifically, with respect to the rollout, the insurance industry in the U.S.

is intensely regulated, and it's regulated on a state-by-state level.

 

That means that we require regulatory approvals from each individual in department of insurance at each individual state.

Texas is the first state that we launched in.

 

I do want to thank the Texas insurance regulators here, you've been great to work with.

We have a road map of additional states.

 

We will launch the product in those states as we receive regulatory approvals.

And our goal is to be in every major market in which we have cars in.

 

The -- we did a soft launch in Texas, was its last week?



Pierre Ferragu 

Uh-huh.

 



Zachary Kirkhorn 

Yeah.

 

And what we're seeing in initial take rate data is that, if you compare that to what we're seeing in California, we're off to a good start here.

So, we're very excited about it.

 

We're excited about individual risk-based pricing.

We're excited about the ability for folks to become safer and as a result, save money.

 

And it feeds into our priority of a Company of building the safest products in the world.



Lars Moravy 

Yeah.

 

If I can add to that, it's really exciting for the engineering team, for the finance team in taking on safety into their world to explore basis.

Thanks for that, guys.

 



Zachary Kirkhorn 

Thank you, Lars.

 



Martin Viecha 

Thank you.

 

Pierre, do you have a follow-up question?



Pierre Ferragu 

No.

 

I think I'm fine, Zach.

Thanks for taking the time to answer.

 

It's fascinating and very interesting.

Yes, I look forward to looking to that.

 



Martin Viecha 

Thank you very much.

 

The next question comes from Joseph Spak from RBC.



Joseph Spak 

Thanks.

 

Can you hear me?



Martin Viecha 

Yeah, we can hear you.

 



Joseph Spak 

Perfect.

 

Zach, as you noticed -- as you noted, you hit low-teens operating margins.

That was your medium-term target.

 

You're there now, despite the number of challenges and not full utilization to the plan.

How are you thinking about that target now?

 

Does it allow you to go lagging, either drive price down further to unlock more demand and invest in other initiatives or does that target and need to change?

And in longer term, do you have an aspirational gross margin target as the mix of software and hardware changes?

 



Zachary Kirkhorn 

Yeah.

 

We have achieved -- we've actually exceeded our long-term guidance on our operating margin target.

So, we're very pleased to see that.

 

And as we look out over the next quarter and the next year, there's a number of puts and takes financially for the Company.

The launch of Austin and Berlin will have ramp inefficiencies there for some period of time until we get those factories up and running.

 

And so that's likely to put some downward pressure on our margins as those factories ramp.

Our goals are to ramp those as quickly as possible.

 

But as Drew mentioned earlier, there are a number of unknown unknowns that we'll need to work through.

We are also in this uncertain environment with respect to cost structure.

 

We are seeing costs increase on the commodity side.

We're getting feedback from our suppliers as we're seeing ourselves the impact of labor shortage.

 

And then logistics and expedite costs just continue to be a part of our story here and it's uncertain how that will unfold.

It's our hope that these things stabilize.

 

Exactly when that happens is difficult to predict.

And we have been adjusting pricing in line with those changes in cost.

 

And so, we'll see how that unfolds over the course of the next year.

So, it's difficult on gross margin to say where that will go for those reasons.

 

With respect to operating margin, we've been very focused as a Company on managing our overhead expenses and operating expenses.

And operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has been declining and I expect that trend to continue to happen.

 

And I think the net of all of this is hopefully that we continue to make progress on operating margin over the next 4 of 5 quarters.

As we think forward, the business up until this point is kind of largely been a hardware automotive business with a little bit of software on top of that.

 

As full self-driving matures, as take rates increase, if we are to raise pricing on that, there's considerable upside both on gross margins and operating margin as that comes to light, as the business starts to become more of a mix of a hardware-based Company and a software-based Company.

So, we feel optimistic about the journey -- very optimistic about the journey as we look over into the long term, just a little bit difficult over the next 4 to 5 quarters.

 

And we'll continue to update on earnings calls as we learn more information.

There's just a lot of uncertainty in the world right now.

 



Martin Viecha 

Thank you, Joe, do you have a follow-up question?

 



Joseph Spak 

Yes, the question is just -- you mentioned LSP acts globally for standard range models.

 

My understanding is that all comes from China.

Is that the continued go-forward plan or do you want to have LSP capabilities in other factories around the world?

 



Zachary Kirkhorn 

Yeah.

 

Certainly, our goal is to localize all key parts of the vehicles on the continent, at least the continent, if not closer to where the vehicles that are produced.

That is our goal and we’re working internally and with our suppliers to accomplish that goal.

 

And not just at the end assembly level, but as far upstream as possible.



Martin Viecha 

Thank you very much.

 

And the next question comes from Colin Langham from Wells Fargo.

Colin, are you able to unmute?

 

While we're waiting for that, let's go to the next one.



Colin Langham

Sorry.

 

Do you hear me now?



Martin Viecha 

Yes, we can hear you now.

 

Perfect.



Colin Langham

Just actually kind of following up on the question before.

 

You mentioned commodities arising, and when I look at a lot of the key raw materials in the battery, cobalt, nickel , lithium, all up 40%.

And I know you guys have done a good job of getting long-term contracts to mitigate that impact.

 

Have you seen so far, any impact from that spike?

And if not, any sense of when that raw material headwind might actually show up or has shown up?

 



Zachary Kirkhorn 

Yeah.

 

We have seen an impact.

Our primary exposure right now is around nickel and aluminum, nickel on the cell, aluminum on non-cell.

 

And we have a mixture of contracts with various suppliers.

In some materials, we contract directly and we have full exposure to price fluctuations.

 

We do have a number of long-term commitments and long-term contracts in place.

We also have contracts where there's some amount of cost -sharing based upon the movement of indexes.

 

And so, as these have been moving, some of those costs have been flowing through to us.

It's not a substantial amount of cost, but it's not small.

 

As we look towards the next year, I certainly hope it doesn't play out this way, but it's possible that we continue to see more of cost headwind, as a result of these movements.

It's difficult to say precisely, but the volatility in the increases are just substantial, so substantial.

 

And there are certain suppliers that maybe up to a certain point have been absorbing some of the increase.

And as contracts expire there, we have to renew and extend them.

 

We'll have to return to negotiations.

And so, what we have to do as a Company and what we are intensely focused on is we need to be continuing to drive down the cost of our products, which we have been doing.

 

And we have to overcome cost increases that are outside of our control.

So whether that's resourcing components or redesigning components or finding ways to be more efficient in manufacturing.

 

We have no choice but to continue on that path and be even more aggressive in the light of the macroeconomics here.



Andrew Baglino 

And diversification.

 

Right.

Doesn't need to be nickel or cobalt, or I mean there's always another option.

 



Martin Viecha 

Thank you.

 

Colin, do you have a follow-up question?

Okay.

 

Let's go to the next one.

The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.

 



Colin Rusch 

Hey, guys, can you hear me okay?

 



Martin Viecha 

Yeah, we can hear you.

 



Colin Rusch 

Perfect.

 

Could you talk a little bit about your strategy around anode materials and your ability to leverage that into reduction on the cathode side and performance from the anode side?



Andrew Baglino 

Sure.

 

I don't know that I am going to get in to too many specifics.

But I guess first, one thing I would say is unlike the commodities discussion we just had, like the anode materials are not really in the same situation just in terms of what they are considering components are so there's less of a focus on rapidly changing them, one way or the other because they're generally stable commodities.

 

There isn't exactly a tit for tat or get a better anode, use less cathode.

There is a fundamental ratio that you need to maintain for the cell to function.

 

–So I guess zooming out, the primary focus on the anodes side that we have is just ensuring that it doesn't in any way -- that we are able to continue to reduce the cost of the anode without impeding on the long-term cyclability of the product.

It can also help with energy density.

 

As you improve the energy density of the anode, you improve the energy density of the cell.

Not directly one-to-one, because you have to pack more cathode in as the anode gets better.

 

And that's a focus as well but the trades basis is just cycling versus day 1 cost.



Martin Viecha 

That's super helpful.

 

And then, just around the vehicle pricing strategy, obviously, there's a lot of flexibility there for some customers and not, can you just talk a little bit about the process around vehicle pricing and how quickly you expect to change that and adjust as you see some of these commodity prices flow through the cost structure, and you look at demand dynamics for vehicles?



Zachary Kirkhorn 

Yeah.

 

Pricing has been a really difficult thing for us over the last couple of quarters.

And we're -- part of the challenge is -- well, the great thing that we're seeing in the space right now is there appears to just be quite a profound awakening of desirability for electric vehicles.

 

And to be totally frank, it's caught us a little bit off guard.

And that kind of awakening and change in consumer sentiment, I'm sure there's lots of reasons that go into it, but folks want to buy an electric car and folks want to buy a Tesla right now.

 

It's very exciting for us.

At the same time, we have installed capacity to build more cars but we're constrained by a number of dynamics as we've talked about in great detail.

 

And we are putting in an extreme effort to build as many cars as we possibly can.

It's hard to overstate how extreme the efforts are.

 

It's quite the grind.

We're trying as hard as we can to maximize that capacity and to be able to meet the demand that we're receiving.

 

But the net-net of all of this is that we're not able to increase production capacity fast enough.

So, at the same time, we are seeing macroeconomic cost impacts on our structure as we've discussed previously on the call.

 

So, we're trying to think through if somebody orders a car now, it could be delivered in some cases, and depending upon the car and which factory, could be a couple of months, could be a couple of quarters.

And the timing in which we build that car will be just before that car gets delivered.

 

And what will the world look like at that point?

And so, we're trying to think through how the cost structure is evolving.

 

How does pricing need to change with that?

What are the supply dynamics in the space?

 

The other thing that I will just note on pricing is that companies change pricing all the time.

The difference is that when Tesla change its pricing, it's extremely transparent, where that's not always the case otherwise.

 

And sometimes our pricing will increase, sometimes our pricing will reduce.

Sometimes to the public, our pricing changes may not seem to make logical sense but there is a strategy that we work behind the scenes as we're balancing supply and demand, as we're also trying to balance various shortages on parts, as we're trying to manage wait times.

 

All of that goes into the optimization here.



Martin Viecha 

Okay.

 

Thank you very much.

The next question is from Brian Johnson from Barclays.

 

And Brian, please go ahead and you can unmute.



Brian Johnson

[Indiscernible]?

 

Can you hear?



Martin Viecha 

Yeah, we can hear you.

 



Brian Johnson

By the way, great to hear there's a team at Tesla, and not just one person shows.

 

I wanted to drill down a bit more on FSD.

In December of 2020 in a Business Insider interview in Germany, your leaders said that he expected level 5 autonomy by December -- within a year, so that would be now.

 

Yet, we look at the progress in FSD and some of the issues you see on YouTube, and it looks very much like a level 2 plus system that requires vigilance.

It's a factor disclaimer site.

 



Brian Johnson

So, I guess there's 3 questions.

 

One, what is the timetable to get to level 4 at least capability, we can deal with the regulatory stuff later.

Two, what is the criteria for Zach, for you to release revenue -- deferred revenue around FSD and it's having a level 2 system that needs monitoring enough to release that deferred revenue?

 

And then three, maybe you could talk a little bit more about how you plan to work with the new -- with the folks at NHTSA who appear to be asking some questions.

They have 3 requests out to you regarding information around the level 2 -- around the capabilities, the natural state.

 



Zachary Kirkhorn 

Yeah, [Inaudible].

 

We'll take them in order.

It's difficult to be specific on the timelines.

 

The bottom half of the team is working extremely hard, iterating on every version.

We're being extremely transparent through the release of this to public customers who are posting information online.

 

When you are using full self-driving and you're going to the iterations, you can feel the progress.

And for those who don't have it in their cars, social media is excellent at getting a sense for how that's progressing.

 

And the team is moving quickly, with every iteration, with every update.

They're working very hard on that.

 

On your second question about the criteria to release deferred revenue, the way that this works is, we have made certain commitments as to what this product can offer at the time that a customer has purchased that.

And so, what we have to assess is, have we met those commitments, and is the software widely available to folks that we've made those commitments to within a certain geography.

 

And given that FSD is still currently in the beta phase, it's invitation only and it's limited, we have not deemed that to be appropriate for recognition of deferred revenue.

And we'll continue to evolve this, we'll continue to monitor it within the finance team to see when we get to the milestones in which we're comfortable releasing.

 

On the NHTSA question, Lars, do you want to take that?



Lars Moravy 

Sure.

 

I mean, as I said earlier, we always corroborate fully with NHTSA and other regulatory bodies in any sort of investigation they may have, particularly related to ADAS systems when they came out with the standing general order in July.

We were quick to respond to that and one of the first and only companies capable of actually meeting the needs of that report.

 

We continue to send that information to them as required, weekly and as it occur.

And with the additional investigations, and as I said, we meet that with great sincerity and we'll work through them one by one to make sure that all the facts come out and NHTSA's well informed about our strategies for both active safety in this case, but also passive safety.

 

As you guys may know, we released updates to our airbag and restraint system last week to Model Y using our fleet data.

We worked closely with NHTSA on that and they were fully in a loop before we did it.

 

So, I think these kinds of things will continue to happen in the new regulatory space as Zach discussed, as we move towards a software-based vehicle and we're happy to be part of that journey.



Martin Viecha 

Thank you very much.

 

And the next question comes from Trip Chowdhry.



Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.

 

Very good quarter.

I had two quick questions.

 

First is regarding the two upcoming factories in Berlin and Austin.

Who are the 2 factories different from each other, maybe in the layout, design, assembly lines?

 

And the second question is related to Cybertruck.

Who is the supply looking at?

 

If you look at the exoskeleton steel, is the supply for that material sufficient for immediate ramp up, I'll say in 23-24 time for Cybertruck?

That's all for me.

 



Lars Moravy 

Yes.

 

Sure.

So obviously, as we've noted in the past, we developed our own stainless-steel grade for the exterior Cybertruck to meet both the durability in course of requirements required for an automotive world.

 

With this raw material and others, as Drew mentioned, we continue to look at multiple sources.

We have made some early sourcing decisions in that but I think we'll keep that one internal and we've already began the first casting in of that.

 

Rolling stainless isn't so different from rolling any other materials.

It's about how hard the rollers are to get to that hardness level.

 

And just like every manufacturing process we put in for every new vehicle, we'll work with our suppliers and vendors to make sure those timelines and supply meet the need and demand of our customers.



Andrew Baglino 

And on the differences between Austin and Berlin, there are some.

 

They're largely associated with the different sort of building architectural choices that were -- happened to occur in collaboration with like local codes and other governing requirements that drives the differences in the architecture between the locations.

In general, though, we're trying to progress the manufacturing system as a system and make logical path to find improvements from factory to factory.

 

And in some cases, there was an improvement identified between -- like decisions for one, Austin, the other, Berlin, or vice versa.

And so there might be a slightly newer iteration of one part of the factory in one place than the other, but it's all part of like a path forward in the factory that builds the machine -- the machine that builds the machine, sorry.

 



Martin Viecha 

Thank you very much.

 

And the last question comes from Jed Dorsheimer from Canaccord.



Jed Dorsheimer 

Can you hear me?

 



Martin Viecha 

Yes, we can hear you.

 



Jed Dorsheimer 

Hey, thanks for taking my question.

 

So, Brandenburg, I'm just wondering, Zach, if you could estimate the carry costs from a margin perspective.

Or I guess in two-parts.

 

So, one, do you -- when do you expect -- do you still expect production coming on in '21?

So, a couple of months left in December.

 

And how do you see that margin impact as a function of the carry costs.

And I do have a follow-up question.

 



Zachary Kirkhorn 

Sure.

 

So, it remains our target in both Austin and Berlin to be able to build our first production cars before the end of the year.

We've talked about this a bit.

 

The unknown of unknowns, new factories, new vehicle designs, new technologies, new locations, new teams.

So, there is quite an execution journey ahead of us, but that remains our target.

 

And all of our plans are oriented around that.

We -- for -- we should not expect for us to deliver cars by the end of 2021 from these factories, even if we do produce some.

 

So, homologation, regulatory reasons, and we want to make sure that we build up some number of cars that we're confident in the quality and the customer experience around them.

The second thing that I'll say and I mentioned this in my opening remarks, is because of the newness here, it's extremely difficult for us to be precise in what the ramp will look like.

 

And its possible things -- the stars align and things move quickly.

It's possible that we're spending the bulk of next year working on ramping these factories.

 

It's just very hard to say, and we'll continue to update you-all to these calls and through other forums.

As to how that then impacts our margins, that is also difficult because that is a function of the ramp, which is uncertain.

 

The benefits here, which is different in the ramp of these factories compared to other factories, is if you think about the percentage of our total cost structure in any given quarter that is associated with new ramps, we have the Fremont factory that's running -- generating stable and growing margins there.

The same is also true in Shanghai.

 

I expect we'll see some amount of headwind on margin from these ramps.

It's just entirely dependent on how quickly we're able to ramp, and what uncertainties come up during the process.

 



Jed Dorsheimer 

Sure, so margins per car, but I would suspect though, if your carry cost is full rate now, on the -- then as you start producing vehicles, it's going to be a margin lifter from where you're at right now, no?

 



Zachary Kirkhorn 

We are carrying some amount of costs associated with the factories today.

 

And so, the incremental costs associated with turning the factory is it's not 100% of the factory, if that's what you're getting at in your question.



Jed Dorsheimer 

Yes, that's what I was getting at.

 



Zachary Kirkhorn 

Yeah.

 

We also actually saw a very similar dynamic to this when we were relaunching Model S earlier in the year.

So, when a product starts launching and then cost of goods sold starts to activate, depreciation starts to activate, there's a bit of a movement in the P&L as to where that cost resides.

 

So yeah, seeming to some extent, Brandenburg and Austin costs are already flowing through our P&L, but we still need to continue staffing and ramping, incurring all the operating costs associated with the factory that we're not spending right now.



Martin Viecha 

Fantastic.

 

Thank you very much, everyone, for all your questions.

And we'll see you again in three months.

 

Thank you very much and goodbye.","Operator

Dan Schulman 

Thanks, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us.

 

Well, the big news today is that for the first time, we're teaming up with Amazon to enable customers in the U.S.

to pay with Venmo at checkout.

 

Starting next year, customers will be able to make purchases on Amazon.com and the Amazon mobile shopping app using their Venmo accounts.

This is, obviously, a very significant moment in our Venmo monetization efforts and marks the beginning of an exciting journey with Amazon, now that we're no longer constrained by the contractual obligations of the eBay operating agreement.

 

The increasing scale and brand trust associated with our two-sided platform continues to set us apart from the rest of the market and enables us to expand our footprint with existing merchants and attract new partners.

And now to our results.

 

Our overall Q3 results were generally in line with our expectations.

Our Total Payment Volume grew 26% on a spot basis to $310 billion.

 

This comes even as eBay's TPV declined by 45% in the quarter and is now approximately 3% of our overall TPV.

Excluding eBay, our volumes grew by 31% on a spot basis with an annualized run rate of $1.2 trillion.

 

Our active accounts were up 15% year-over-year, reaching 416 million.

We added 13.3 million Net New Active accounts in the quarter, including another 1.2 million merchant accounts, bringing our total merchant count to 33 million, and we remain on track to deliver more than 52 million NNAs for the year.

 

Importantly, our diverse suite of products and services drove double-digit growth in our transactions for active accounts up 10% to 44.2 times.

Revenues in the quarter grew to $6.182 billion, growing 13% on a spot basis.

 

This was slightly below our expectations as back-to-school sales and travel were weaker than we expected.

But even so, excluding eBay, our revenues grew by 25% in Q3.

 

eBay now represents less than 4% of our total revenues, and we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.11, even as we continue to invest heavily in our growth initiatives.

Our platform continues to drive substantial value for our merchants.

 

PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet, with more than 75% of the top 1,500 largest global merchants utilizing PayPal at checkout, and on average, our PayPal checkout conversion is 34% higher than other checkout options.

In addition to our Amazon news, we are very pleased to say that Walmart now presents PayPal as a checkout option for both their grocery and marketplace business, and GoFundMe added PayPal to their checkout flow with Venmo to follow in the coming months.

 

Valero and Phillips 66 are adding our QR codes to their thousands of gas stations across the U.S., and United Airlines recently launched PayPal QR payments inflight.

As checkout evolves from pay now to pay on your own terms, we've seen rapid adoption of our Buy Now, Pay Later capabilities in the U.S., Germany, France, UK, and Australia.

 

In Q4, we will expand Buy Now, Pay Later to Italy and Spain.

Also in this quarter, we eliminated consumer late fees to ensure we deliver the very best value proposition to our consumers, while delivering on our mission to build an inclusive digital economy.

 

Since our Buy Now, Pay Later launch, we have processed approximately $5.4 billion in TPV, with more than $2 billion of that TPV in Q3 alone.

Approximately 950,000 merchants have customers who use our Buy Now, Pay Later capabilities, and more than 65,000 have positioned Buy Now, Pay Later upstream on their product pages, and over 9.5 million consumers have transacted more than 33 million times with our Buy Now, Pay Later products.

 

We will expand our global pay later portfolio in the first half of 2022 to include longer-term installment plans, allowing consumers to spread higher-price purchases over longer periods of time.

This is already available in Germany, where we are seeing great initial success.

 

We completed our acquisition of Paidy, a fast-growing, two-sided payments platform, and provider of Buy Now, Pay Later solutions in Japan.

This will accelerate our momentum in Japan, a strategically important market and one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world.

 

We are seeing very positive trends on our new PayPal App, which has now ramped to 100% globally.

Consumers are engaging with the app and discovering the breadth of our new value proposition.

 

Although it's still early, initial results show that the new app has driven a 25 times lift in consumers exploring our deals and offer [staff] (ph); a 15% increase in first-time users transacting with crypto, and it has also driven a 35% lift in our cash card enrollments, and the average revenue per account from digital wallet users is twice that of checkout only users.

We expect to launch more features next year, including equity investing capabilities.

 

It is quite exciting to see the initial positive reaction to our app, and we will continue to refine and expand its functionality to help consumers navigate an increasingly digital and connected lifestyle.

Venmo continues to achieve milestones and break records and is on track to deliver $900 million in revenue this year.

 

With more than 80 million customers, and $240 billion in run rate TPV Venmo's scale is on par with PayPal's entire U.S.

franchise in 2016.

 

Venmo’s customers are adopting more and more products, and we're seeing accelerating momentum with our new product introductions.

Even with all this growth and these impressive accomplishments, we are just at the start of Venmo's commerce journey, and we could not be more pleased about joining forces with Amazon.

 

We expect Venmo to be transaction margin positive this year, while still growing its P2P business at very healthy rates.

Back half of 2021 was always going to be the low point of our revenue growth this year, and we are appropriately cautious as we enter Q4 and as we think about 2022.

 

We are seeing the impact of global supply chain shortages in our merchant base, consumer confidence is weakened with the absence of stimulus payments and with the economy reopening, more people may be likely to do their holiday shopping in store, as confidence in delivery logistics is depressed from last year, and of course, we still feel the impact of eBay’s managed payments migration over the next few quarters, although at a lessening rate.

Almost all of these issues are temporal, and consequently, we expect our revenues will accelerate throughout next year, and we remain confident in our medium-term guidance.

 

I'd like to spend a few moments on the recent rumors that made their way through the news.

We participate in a rapidly moving industry and it's quite clear that consumers and merchants prefer a more connected, digital lifestyle that encompasses financial services, shopping, payments, and commerce.

 

Our market research and that of others, strongly supports the vision of a more connected economy, and PayPal clearly has the brand trust, regulatory relationships and scale to be a meaningful leader in the digital economy.

Exploring all potential opportunities to enhance shareholder value is our responsibility.

 

But obviously, only a select few deals will meet our very strict financial, strategic, and capital allocation criteria.

We are fortunate to be a market leader in an environment with so many potential opportunities, and operate in an industry with a number of favorable tailwinds.

 

We will continue to execute against our game plan and responsibly explore the options in our rapidly evolving ecosystem so that we remain the leader we are today in tomorrow's world.

And with that, I will turn the call over to John.

 



John Rainey

Thanks, Dan.

 

I'd like to start by thanking our customers, partners, and employees for helping us deliver a solid quarter.

We're now reporting our results for the 7th quarter since the pandemic began, and it's remarkable to take a step back and reflect on everything that we've accomplished during this dynamic and unprecedented time.

 

There's been a profound and enduring shift in global commerce and consumer behavior, which has significantly expanded our addressable opportunity.

The powerful and accelerating secular tailwinds of increasing e-commerce penetration and cash displacement have helped to advance our leadership position in payments.

 

To give you a better sense of the scale of growth we've experienced, it took 20 years for PayPal to reach $600 [billion] (ph) in annual payment volume, which occurred in 2019.

Only 2 years later, we crossed $1.2 trillion.

 

Relative to 2019, we've seen significant growth across our key performance indicators, including active accounts, engagement, TPV, revenue, EPS, and free cash flow.

At the same time, we're operating in a complex environment.

 

The macroeconomic landscape is currently characterized by varying rates of reopening activity globally and influenced by short-term supply chain challenges, inflationary pressures, and concerns related to consumer sentiment.

These factors contribute to a backdrop that continues to make forecasting more challenging.

 

Our third quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our diversified platform, our global reach, and the scalability of our business.

Notably, we delivered these results against tough year-over-year comparisons and in the quarter where we faced the most acute pressure from eBay's payments transition.

 

For the quarter, we are reporting revenue of $6.2 billion representing growth of 13% on both a spot and currency neutral basis.

eBay Marketplace's revenue declined 67% to $235 million and contributed less than 4% of total revenue, versus approximately 13% last year.

 

Excluding eBay, revenue grew 25% year-over-year, and 26% on average for the last 2 years.

This 2-year compound annual growth rate, is particularly notable.

 

Throughout 2021, this growth rate has been consistently strong at 25% and 26% in the first and second quarters respectively.

I would also like to provide some context for our performance relative to our expectations when we provided third quarter guidance in late July.

 

First, travel volumes strengthened in June and July.

This trend then reversed in August and September due to concerns related to the Delta Variant.

 

Second, back-to-school spending was somewhat softer than we had expected.

While our overall performance was well within our guidance, we saw moderation towards the tail end of the quarter and exited at a lower growth rate than we had predicted.

 

In the third quarter, transaction revenue grew 10% to $5.6 billion.

This growth rate reflects the steep decline in eBay revenue in the quarter.

 

Excluding eBay, transaction revenue grew 23%.

Other value-added services revenue grew 50% to $575 million.

 

This performance was driven by increased revenue from Synchrony, and accelerated recognition of loan servicing fees from the PPP program.

In the third quarter, total take rates, was 1.99% consistent with the second quarter and a decline of 22 basis points from last year.

 

The mix effect of eBay contributed to approximately 55% of this decline.

The blended take rate on eBay volumes this quarter was 2.43% compared to 4% in Q3 last year.

 

The remainder of the decline was primarily driven by reduced currency volatility in the quarter, which resulted in a lower growth rate in foreign exchange fees, as well as merchant mix and growth and bill payment volumes.

The 25-basis point decline in transaction take rate was driven by these same factors.

 

The third quarter was another strong quarter for volume-based expense performance.

Transaction expense as a rate of TPV was 83 basis points, an increase of 1 basis point versus last year.

 

Transaction losses improved 4 basis points and represented 9 basis points as the rate of TPV.

This level of loss performance is consistent with last quarter, matching the lowest transaction loss rate in our history.

 

In the quarter, loan origination activity increased and we ended Q3 with $3.7 billion in net receivables representing sequential growth of 13%, and 43% growth relative to last year.

Growth in our short-term installment pay portfolio was the primary driver of this increase.

 

Strong performance of our loan portfolio, more stability in macroeconomic trends, and the mix of shorter duration originations from our installment pay products, resulted in our reserve coverage ratio declining to 11.6% from 14.9% at the end of the second quarter.

The net effect of credit provisioning on credit losses in the quarter, inclusive of originations and reserve releases, resulted in a benefit of $25 million, and year-to-date, we released $300 million in reserves.

 

Overall, volume based expenses grew 20% and represented 46% of revenue, resulting in a transaction margin of 54.2%.

I'd now like to cover our non-transaction related operating expenses.

 

These expenses increased 17%, representing 30% of revenue.

In the third quarter, our rapid pace of innovation continued.

 

We had an exciting cadence of product introductions, including our new digital wallet apps for both PayPal and Venmo, the launch of Crypto buy, hold, sell in the UK, our goods and services P2P experience in Venmo, and cash back to Crypto with the Venmo credit card.

To support and advance our key initiatives, we continue to invest aggressively in technology and development, and sales and marketing, including increased spending on customer acquisition and engagement strategies.

 

These expense buckets drove 70% of the increase in non transaction related operating expenses.

On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was essentially flat to last year and our operating margin was 23.8%, and on a 2-year basis, the compound annual growth rate for operating income was 20%.

 

For the quarter non-GAAP EPS grew 4% to $1.11.

This includes an approximate $0.29 per share headwind from the decline in eBay Marketplaces, transaction margin dollars.

 

We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $20 billion.

In addition, free cash flow grew 20% to $1.3 billion, representing 21% of revenue.

 

I'd now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2021, as well as our preliminary thoughts for 2022.

For 2021, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $25.3 to $25.4 billion, an increase of approximately 18% from last year.

 

This represents a 2-year compound annual growth rate of 19%, and excluding eBay, we now expect 2021 revenue to grow 28%.

We expect our operating margin to be in line to last year, which was the highest in our history.

 

This performance reflects our strategic investment spend throughout the year, as well as the negative transaction margin dynamics resulting from eBay, offset by the benefit from the release of reserves.

We now expect non-GAAP EPS for the year to be approximately $4.60, a 19% increase on top of the 31% growth last year.

 

In our 2-year basis, this is 25% growth.

In addition, we expect to generate approximately $5.2 billion in free cash flow, representing $0.21 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue we earn.

 

As a result of this update to our full-year guidance, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $6.85 billion to $6.95 billion.

This represents approximately 13% growth at the midpoint.

 

We also expect a $1.12 in non-GAAP EPS, representing 4% growth.

While the impact from eBay's payments migration came in consistent with our expectations for the quarter, relative to the beginning of the year, the headwind increased significantly.

 

Until recently, we believe we could absorb this additional pressure and still deliver on our prior guidance, and while we came within our revenue expectations for the third quarter, the contributors to our revenue growth were somewhat different than what we had expected going into the quarter.

Towards the end of the quarter, we also began to see growth rates coming a little lower than planned.

 

We're off to a solid start in the fourth quarter, but growth rate still remains slightly below our prior expectations.

In addition, retail supply chain and labor market concerns which may impact the important holiday season have led us to adopt a more cautious stance for the fourth quarter.

 

That said, in recent days, we've seen improvement.

At this point in time it's difficult to say definitively whether the stronger turns will persist throughout the quarter, or if this improvement is a pull-forward of consumer holiday activity.

 

Relative to the guidance provided at the start of 2021, we now expect revenue to be about 0.5% lower for the year, despite much more pressure from eBay than we had initially expected.

Adjusting for the additional pressure to revenue growth from eBay, our revised 2021 guidance is actually ahead of the outlook we provided at the start of the year.

 

In providing quarterly and annual guidance since July of last year, our goal has been to responsibly balance transparency with reliability and certainty.

At the same time, we've also tried to emphasize the complexity of forecasting in this environment.

 

We are taking what we view to be a prudent step in adjusting our outlook.

But let me be very clear, our key strategic initiatives are on track and performing very well.

 

The initial response to our new digital wallet experiences has been very strong, and the implementation of our new headline pricing in the U.S.

has been successful with no discernible impact to merchant activity.

 

The underlying strength, diversification, and resilience of our business on an absolute level, and relative to pre-pandemic are unassailable and position us to remain on offense regardless of short-term headwinds.

Our ability to sustainably deliver strong growth at our scale is indicative of the network effects of our business and our competitive positioning as a global leader in digital payments at the intersection of the powerful secular tailwinds of e-commerce penetration and cash displacement has never been stronger.

 

As it relates to our expectations for 2022, we'd like to share some of our initial thoughts and the assumptions we're making for internal planning purposes.

We are currently in the midst of our budget resource, and investment planning process for next year.

 

In addition, how we exit the year, as well as the status of some of the exogenous factors that Dan and I have already discussed, are also important inputs for the year ahead.

On a preliminary basis for 2022, we expect revenue growth in the high teens.

 

If we had to put a point on it today, we'd likely anchor it at about 18%.

It's also important to appreciate our expected trajectory of revenue growth.

 

Due to the cadence of eBay's payments migration, as well as the stimulus measures earlier this year, we expect the first quarter next year to have more difficult comps and be our lowest growth quarter.

Our plans are for revenue growth to then accelerate through the year, and to exit 2022 at a revenue growth rate in line with or ahead of our medium-term guidance.

 

Similar to 2021, we expect that our growth rates will exceed industry growth rates by a healthy margin.

Given the ongoing planning that we're still doing, we will guide EPS growth when we report Q4 results early next year.

 

That said I'd like to provide some color on how we're thinking about it.

We see significant investment opportunities across our key priorities.

 

In the past few years we've accelerated our pace of product innovation to better serve our growing network of more than 400 million consumer and merchant accounts.

We are investing to advance our product roadmap, increase our relevance for customers, and drive daily engagement, and to support these initiatives, we expect our non transaction-related expenses to grow in the high single digits in 2022 on a base that will grow 20% this year.

 

It's also important to note 2 factors that will have an impact on our EPS growth next year.

First, we will lap the benefit we realized from the release of the credit reserve this year, and second, we expect our effective tax rate to increase from the lapping of one time favorable tax adjustments.

 

We expect these 2 items to result in an approximate 10-point headwind to non-GAAP earnings growth in 2022.

That said, we remain very confident in the medium-term guidance we provided at our Investor Day earlier this year.

 

We're witnessing the pull forward at e-commerce and displacement of cash continuing at an undiminished pace, even as reopening occurs, it's also true that the most difficult year in the transition away from eBay will be largely behind us as we move into 2022 and we expect our revenue and TPV growth rates to accelerate.

We believe that investing in our business is more important than ever before, given the opportunities we see in front of us, and while we certainly expect our margins to increase over the long-term, we don't want to be so overly focused on that for one quarter, or one year to the next, that we don't invest appropriately.

 

We're playing in this space to win.

We are well-positioned to capture the immense opportunity ahead and see a clear path to achieving our financial and strategic objectives.

 

Our powerful 2-sided platform focused on execution and mission-driven culture, backed by the tailwinds of digital commerce, set us up for success now, and in the years to come.

Before I turn it back over to the Operator for Q&A, I would like to spend a moment discussing our approach to capital allocation.

 

Our business is characterized by its very powerful cash flow generation.

Since separation, we generated approximately $22 billion in free cash flow.

 

We've returned nearly $10.5 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, and allocated approximately $13 billion in cash to acquisitions and investments.

We remain committed to both a disciplined capital allocation and to balancing organic and inorganic growth investing to drive shareholder value creation.

 

Inorganic opportunities are accelerant to our growth plans and to achieving our long-term aspirations.

It's important to note that our medium-term outlook does not rely on acquisitions.

 

At the same time, we will continue to be opportunistic in executing our strategic priorities, shaping the future of payments, and advancing our leadership position.

With that, I will turn it back to the operator.

 

Operator, please go ahead.
Operator

Thank you.

 

[Operators Instructions] As a reminder, please limit yourself to ask one question only and you may return to the queue for a follow-up question.

We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.

 

First question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.

Your line is now open.

 

You may ask your question.



Tien-Tsin Huang

Thanks so much.

 

Real exciting to hear about the Amazon news.

I noticed a lot to talk about here, but I wanted to ask on the market rumors on Pinterest if you don't mind and I know you are not pursuing a deal at this time, But just wanted to ask if your appetite to do a large deal is still there?

 

If your longer-term outlook hinges on adding any assets like that with different revenue sources like advertising?

I know, John, you said you're not counting on M&A for mid-term, just thinking a longer-term here.

 

Thank you.



Dan Schulman 

Yeah.

 

I'll start off with that and then John can chime in on this.

Let me just take one step back, and start a little bit with the big picture because that may help put everything into context.

 

Look, we're obviously focused on becoming an essential everyday app for consumers, and that's on the consumer side, and on the merchant side, we want to provide a comprehensive platform for merchants to participate in the digital economy, and that includes everything from consumers engaging at the beginning of their shopping journey to purchase and post-purchase, and if you look at all of the acquisitions that we've done over the past 5 years, they kind of play into that overall strategy, whether it be what we've done internally with the PayPal App or QR codes, acquisitions like Honey, which have been essential to our shopping and deals tab fully integrated now into the PayPal App.

Happy Returns, Chargehound that are part of our post-purchase process that we'll integrate into our app and put into our platform for merchants, iZettle Hyperwallet now is our payouts product going forward.

 

So I’m very pleased with all the acquisitions we’ve done, they fit into our strategy, they're executing, many of them well above what we initially thought, some were delayed in terms of their integration for various reasons, but overall, really and pleased with the way our acquisition and acquisition strategy has gone and the integration into our strategy.

The truth is we review hundreds of potential acquisitions every single year and we put every single one of them through a very strict set of strategic financial integration filters and we look at like are we going to buy, build or partner, and, you know, John and I have been here now for - well, I've been here a little over 7 years, [Indiscernible] closing in on that – and we have never done a large acquisition so far, and the reason for that, and by the way, we look at a couple of those every year.

 

There's very few that we look at, but we look at a couple every year and they have a much higher hurdle rate than our smaller acquisitions.

I mean, we want to look, is it going to be a distraction?

 

How tough is the integration?

We fully understand what it means to do a large acquisition versus a small acquisition and in seven years we haven't done a single large acquisition because they haven't met any of our hurdles.

 

I'm not saying that we might never ever do that, but - so it's not a likely event as we look forward.

And our M&A philosophy, it remains the same.

 

We're going to focus on high-quality assets that will accelerate our growth in areas that are more efficient than us doing it inorganically, and to your question specifically, we don't need to do something large to or small, frankly, to deliver on our medium-term guidance.

All of our acquisitions are supplemental to our medium-term guidance, and clearly, we're going to be acquisitive going forward.

 

I mean, we've got incredibly strong balance sheet, $20 billion cash and cash-like investments on it.

We're generating between $5 billion and $6 billion a year of free cash flow.

 

But we are going to maintain the same strict and disciplined manner that we look at acquisitions that have lifted acquisitions over the last couple of years.

John, anything that you can add?

 



John Rainey

I think you covered a lot of it, Dan.

 

I just would add, Tien-Tsin, that we laid out what we believe to be a very compelling case at our Investor Day around value-creation over the next 5 years.

That was entirely an organic plan and remain so.

 

But that said, we don't want to sit here on our hands and think that that's good enough.

If there are opportunities that are out there that create even more value creation, it's our responsibility to look at those, and so that's where deals of this size may come in sometimes, but we take capital allocation as a very serious activity for us, and then arguably one of the most important, and so as they have said we have a lot of rigor around that, and thus far nothing has matched those rigorous hurdles for us.

 

But I think and the management team shares a belief that we have the same opportunity over the next 5 years to create value that we just realized over the last 5 years.

But if we can do more than that, then we should do more than that, and so that's why we explore every opportunity, but the growth plans that we laid out in the early part of this year at our Investor Day are entirely organic.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird.

Your line is now open.

 

You may ask the question.



Colin Sebastian

Good afternoon everybody.

 

So pretty big news here with Amazon on the Venmo integration, especially given how protective Amazon is over their checkout flow, so congrats there and it might be helpful to expand a bit on what you talked about Dan around the agreement such as are the economics with Amazon similar to other marketplace deals that you have in place, are there opportunities to expand the relationships to other PayPal brands and services and maybe when in 2022 we can expect that to show up on the site.

Thanks very much.

 



Dan Schulman 

You bet, thanks, Colin.

 

Good question.

First of all, I'd say one of the things we talked about early on is being free of the restrictions of the eBay operating agreement.

 

We're going to have the possibility to open us up to working with a number of marketplaces that we were previously prohibited from doing so, and you're seeing some of that.

You are seeing what we're doing with Ali and AliExpress, that continues to expand in terms of the volumes.

 

There we are getting closer and closer with Walmart and Amazon is the latest example of us being able to team up with obviously an extremely significant player in the e-commerce space, and what I really like about this is like eBay results are like a pig to the Python right now.

But these that we're talking about, right, are much more of a permanent nature.

 

These are what will be with us going forward as eBay is a temporal phenomenon working through our results.

We're still working through the launch timeframes.

 

We are both eager to get this out into the marketplace, but we're still working those two, we obviously have large teams, each of us on this.

It is the beginning of a journey of our two companies teaming together.

 

I wouldn't venture at this moment as to where we'll go together; we're both very focused on the substantial opportunity that there is with Venmo at checkout, and we couldn't be more pleased to be able to team with Amazon on this.

Obviously, if you think about the amount of market share that Amazon has in the U.S.

 

this quite substantially increases the addressable market for Pay with Venmo.

And Pay with Venmo is one of the key revenue drivers for Venmo going forward.

 

Just as I think about the journey that Venmo has been on, this obviously is a punctuation point for sure.

But even this year, Venmo will be transaction margin positive.

 

That is a major milestone for that team, right on track to deliver the $900 million and obviously, exit the year at an accelerating growth rate and this partnership with Amazon will no doubt take that to next level.



John Rainey

Colin, I'll just add real quickly that Dan and I both appreciate that the investor community probably is getting tired of us talking about eBay and eBay results, but arguably not more so than we are, but this is the other side of that coin.

 

It's as simple as that.

I mean this would not be allowed had we not taken the steps that we had, and so we're quite excited about this and what it bodes for the future.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson.

Your line is open.

 



Lisa Ellis

Thanks.

 

Good afternoon.

I'm going to focus on the roll out of the new PayPal and Venmo apps.

 

I know you made some comments in the prepared remarks, but can you elaborate a bit further, give a little more color on the early impact you're seeing maybe on user growth, engagement growth, etc., including maybe some aspects so far that have surprised you?

Thank you.

 



Dan Schulman 

Yes.

 

Thanks, Lisa, good to hear your voice.

So anytime you put something substantial out into the market, and this is really the first giant revamp that we've done of our PayPal consumer app and it's pretty massive, complete redesign.

 

Typically on that, so what you find is you've got declines in engagement as people kind of like work their way through discovery of it, and then what you have is, over time, that really starts to accelerate, as we said you know.

This has been completely the opposite which is the biggest delight, I'm not sure it's a surprise to me, but we are seeing, really, meaningful leaps in terms of our discoverability of the breadth of our products and service line right now.

 

We talk about PayPal shopping, the full integration of Honey into the PayPal App, Honey now is completely mobile, and not just desktop, and that is empowering a whole tab of that.

We've seen a 25 times lift in people exploring that tab and starting to put deals into their wallets and that kind of thing.

 

It’s pretty amazing.

On things like crypto, first-time user, once we did the app went up by 15%.

 

Our strongest week ever for first-time users was like last week.

We’ve had strong weeks for first time users of growth on that, but clearly the new app is driving both discoverability and conversion on the crypto side.

 

And then I'm quite excited about what's happening with cash card.

Because cash card is kind of like a debit card, right?

 

In relation to the balance, and it can be used offline and obviously online, and this is a big part of our omni strategic thrust, and to see that go up, there's enrollment score up by 35%, and remember, this is really early days, we fully ramped in the middle of October, globally.

So this is early on and I usually think of early on as, okay, how do we start to claw back to where we were and then start to move forward as customers get it.

 

This was a leap forward.

Look, there are a lot of things that we're going to do to improve the customer experience.

 

We're putting FIS now into our bill payment, expanding our bill payment quite dramatically, expanding the usability and kind of the simplicity of it , but each and every one of the products and services we are looking at the feedback we're getting and just making small little changes to keep increasing.

This is going to be, I didn't think it was going to be a big bang, it actually just turned out to be a relatively big bang on introduction.

 

But I really think of this as evolutionary quarter-by-quarter-by quarter.

We will launch high-yield savings in the next several months that will begin to ramp, will start to put on things like equity investing, we anticipate doing that next year and there’ll be more and more products and services to help customers engage more and more, and that's why like that ARPA, wallet users versus checkout only, again early, but to see that already leaping up to 2 times that of checkout only.

 

that’s why John and I are quite excited about the impact of the initiatives that we're putting into place, and they are clearly going to drive a lot of growth for us as we look forward.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI



David Togut

Thanks for taking my question.

 

Looking at the third quarter KPIs, they’re certainly strong and broadly in line with your 5-year guide, and then you called out some short-term factors and tough comparisons for taking guidance down for the fourth quarter and guiding 2022, at least, your preliminary guide below the 5-year model.

But when you look at 2022, at some of the shorter-term factors, you've called out like supply chain issues and return of consumers more to the physical POS, how confident are you that some of these issues are actually shorter term versus potentially longer lasting that might stretch into 2023?

 



Dan Schulman 

Okay.

 

David, let me talk very quickly about Q3 and then I'm going to have John talk about our Q4 guidance and our confidence in 2022.

So you're right, actually, if you look at Q3, and let me just talk about revenue, TPV, and maybe engagement, as 3 metrics on that.

 

The way that I think about our business right now is what's happening on our MS business.

Because eBay is a temporal thing, it's just going through the system right now.

 

It's less than 3% of our TPV, it’s less than 4% of our revenues, and dropped, and so really our business is our MS Business going forward.

And if I look at revenue, revenue growth.

 

I think this is really interesting because I examined this quite carefully.

If I go back 5 years and look at our MS revenue growth, in Q3 of 2017, it was 24%.

 

In 2018 in Q3, it was 17%; 2019 was 23% then it jumps up to 26% in the middle of the pandemic, Q3 2020 and Q3 2021, this quarter it is 25%, and so like people talk about reopening stuff, like that is enough.

Our MS business is going from strength to strength.

 

We have seen a leap forward in digital, and that is continuing, if you look at it in our MS and John will talk about it in Q4, and as we look next year.

Same thing on TPV.

 

TPV in Q3 of 2018.

MS, I'm talking about MS, was 27%, it jumped up to 29%.

 

Then in Q3, 2020 it jumped to 40% and over that 40%, we're growing this quarter at 31%, and so these are all really, really strong numbers, and if I look at even like transactions, which I think it's really interesting, we did 4.9 billion transactions in Q3 this last quarter.

If you go back a year ago, we did about 4 billion, we're almost up a billion transactions in a year in the quarter, and our transactions ex-eBay are up 31% year-over-year.

 

Our TPA transactions were active, double-digit growth for the second quarter in a row.

Again, ex-eBay in the third quarter, our TPA was up 18%, and so these are, yes, of course, we get hit by some of these exogenous things that go on.

 

But if I look at the strength of the core business every single metric is way above, even our forecast is way above our medium-term guidance, and that's kind of like what gives us just a ton of confidence, and we are obviously being, I think appropriately cautious and conservative as we look forward at this time, but I feel like if I look at the what the real part of our business is every metric is trending pretty strongly right now.



John Rainey

David, let me hit a couple of points here regarding some of the assumptions about our outlook.

 

So first, with respect to the reopening of the economy, our basic assumption is that that's sort of a slow and steady pace similar to what we've seen here more recently.

With respect to supply chain or labor shortages, I don't see a quick fix to that, so that could be with us for some period of time and I think the pressure there's probably more acute on some of the SMB segment versus large enterprises, and so that is baked into our assumptions as well.

 

We’re also not going to have the benefit of stimulus next year or likely not based upon what we see today, and then the last point I'd make is around eBay.

eBay, if you think about the high teens or 18%-mark that we put out there for revenue growth, the impact to eBay year-over-year in terms of a headwind is about 200 basis points.

 

If you just take what eBay represents in our business in 2021 compared to 2022.

Said differently though, if we were to exclude eBay in both years, the revenue growth is 22%, and so that's exceedingly strong, and I think the best proxy for how to think about our business going forward, and so wrapping all of that together and sort of tying it to where we stand right now with the guidance that we just gave today.

 

If you go back to the beginning of the year, and the guidance that we provided, 50 million Net New Actives, roughly $25.5 billion of revenue, we're effectively right there, and I think very, very importantly, that was the basis for the 5-year plan, the medium-term guidance that we laid out just a few weeks after that, and so that's a way of saying that we are right on track with what we have laid out at the beginning of the year with our medium term guidance.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.

Your line is open.

 



Darrin Peller

Hey.

 

Thanks, guys.

I just wanted to touch on the organic trends of the business, mainly the KPI Net New Actives and just maybe if you can give a little more color on the organic dynamics you are seeing now, a year and a half into COVID, in terms of gross adds versus mature levels, and we're also getting more questions on '22 guidance and some of the inputs there that you just touched on that, John, so thanks, but thinking about the underlying, sort of user growth potential there, engagement potential, and then really just reminding us of your conviction in the drivers getting to 750 million of NNA long-term?

 

Thanks, guys.



Dan Schulman 

Sure, so let me talk a little bit about NNAs.

 

So $13.3 million in the quarter up about $2 million from last quarter, growing 15% year-over-year unlike a lot of companies that experienced growth during the COVID time, and then unwinding our growth remains incredibly strong on the NNA side.

I mean, think about it, in the minute that we have been talking, so far Derrin, we put on about 100 consumers and 9 new merchants.

 

We're putting on 1.5 consumers every second of the quarter, every 6 seconds we've put on another merchant, so really unbelievable.

And if I look 5 years ago, you remember this, 5 years ago we put on 13 million Net New Actives for the year we just had this quarter alone we've put on a 110 million Net New Active since January of 2020, and as we said, I think in our press release we expect to end the year in north of 430 million actives on the platform.

 

So you know obviously continued strong growth, but as you look forward to that 750 million, there are 2 places that our Net New Actives come from.

One is top of the funnel, and top of the funnel is actually pretty strong right now and remain so.

 

It's just kind of a must have platform for merchants and consumers and scale begets scale in this business.

But as you get bigger and bigger, the bottom of the funnel becomes equally, if not even more, important, and so reduction in churn becomes a really important element of our ability to get to the $750 million.

 

That's why we're so excited about what we're seeing in terms of our TPA numbers again normalize it, ex-eBay up 18%.

Last quarter, I think it was up 17% double-digit growth even with eBay and 2 quarters in a row, some of the things I was talking to Lisa about in terms of the engagement on the app, those are things that the more people engage, the more people get cash cards and start utilizing that service offline, we see halo effects inside the business, Buy Now, Pay Later all of that that actually effects churn rate, and if we can keep a consistent top of the funnel, maybe even improve that a little bit, but reduce our churn rate, you'll start to see Net New Actives actually accelerate going forward and so we remain so quite confident in the 750, but that's what the drivers are of that Derrin.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley.

Your line is open.

 



James Faucette

Thank you very much and thanks for all the color and detail of things that you're going through.

 

John, I know you kind of touched around this in your commentary, but if we think about all the irons and initiatives that you have in the fire right now, how should we think about kind of the medium-term progression of your operating margins?

I know you also highlighted that you want to make investments, but just trying to make sure that we try to align our own expectations with how you're thinking about your planning purposes going forward.

 

Thanks.



John Rainey

So I'll start by saying that, I would hope that people appreciate and agree with this, but I don't think there's ever been a more important time to invest in our business than right now.

 

This is a precious opportunity that we have with some of the secular tailwinds.

We're fortunate in that the margins on our business want to go up.

 

We've demonstrated that we can scale at a very low marginal cost, we've got tremendous opportunities some of which we've talked about today, that give us confidence that over our planning horizon, our margins will go up.

That's not something that I think we lose a ton of sleep about.

 

Quite frankly, I think the more challenging dynamic is where to invest, where we can get that return that's expected, and if you think about the last couple of years being 2020 and this year 2021, our operating expenses have grown about 20% each of those years, and I would discourage you from thinking about that as a sort of one-time spend related to customer acquisition or something like that.

There's a lot of like engineering costs around people that are punching the keyboard to write code, and that's still with us today.

 

So even as we talked about the high single-digit growth next year, that's on top of 2 years of 20% growth.

But for us it’s also important not to spread ourselves too thin and to make sure that we are prioritizing appropriately and some prioritizing involves, say notice our things as well.

 

And so I think we've laid out a pretty clear plan over the next few years with our focus on things like the digital wallet, building out commerce capabilities, continue to monetize Venmo that give us ample opportunity to invest.

But as I noted in my remarks, we don't manage the business to have margin expansion for the next quarter, or frankly even for the next year.

 

We're looking at how we create a Company over the next 5 years, that can have the same type of market value appreciation that we've experienced over the last 5 and the decisions that we make really just lineup with that much more so that trying to maximize for any particular time period.

And so maybe not directly answering your question, but our margins are going to go up over the long term and we're not going to be handcuffed to doing that from one period to the next at the expense of like creating shareholder value.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

We have time for one last question, comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America.

Your line is open.

 



Jason Kupferberg

Thank you, guys.

 

Hey, how are you?

I guess, they're now tracking to more of the lower end of the 52 to 55 million target for the year previously thought to be closer to the higher end.

 

So I'm just wondering, is this some incremental softness in gross adds, is it higher churn, a decline in new activations?

It seems like we may be down a little bit quarter-over-quarter in Q4 but normally there is some positive seasonality.

 

So just wanted to get your take on what’s going with the NNA?

Thanks.

 



Dan Schulman 

Yeah, great question Jason.

 

Thank you for that.

If you remember we started the year at 50 million then we raised it 52 to 55 and then we thought we'd be towards the higher end of the 52 to 55.

 

At this point, we're just being consistent with our revenue guide as well.

We're going into the heart of the holiday, you're exactly right.

 

If holiday season shapes up like it did last year, then we'll have more than 52 million organic because there would be a lot more of shopping, and if it doesn't, then we'll have a little bit less.

So it's very consistent with us just being, I think prudent and cautious given some of the trends that we're seeing and others are talking about.

 

Again, supply chain shortages, people can’t shop if consumer confidence is down, people do more in store, we’ll get less M&As than we typically might, .

If the holiday season goes as it did last year, we'll get more than we are talking about right now.

 

So I just think it's just very consistent with the guide that we gave, and again, as John mentioned, we had a good start to the quarter, we’ve had a pretty strong last week report too, but we're early on right now and so we don't like it when we are at the mid-point of our guidance or any of that kind of thing.

We are used to being a Company that puts out things and then beach what it puts out, and we want to assure that what we say is appropriate and an appropriately conservative on it.

 

So that's how I think I would answer that question, Jason.
Operator

Thank you.

 



Dan Schulman 

All right.

 

Operator, thank you, Jason for that last question, really look forward to talking to all of you over the course of the next couple of days and weeks and at a number of different conferences, and thank you for all your support and your time today.
Operator

Thank you.

 

This concludes today's conference call.

You may now disconnect.

 ","Operator

Please standby, we're about to begin.

 

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.

 

This call is being recorded.

Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call.

 

We will now go live to the presentation.

Please standby.

 

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum.

Mr.

 

Barnum, please go ahead.



Jeremy Barnum

Thanks, Operator.

 

Good morning, everyone.

The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.

 

Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $11.7 billion, EPS of $3.74 on revenue of 30.4 billion, and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 22%.

These results include a $2.1 billion net credit reserve release, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, as well as an income tax benefit of 566 million.

 

Adjusting for these items, we delivered an 18% or OTC this quarter, touching on a few highlights.

It was another strong quarter for investment banking, including an all-time record for M&A.

 

And while loan growth remains muted, we see a number of indicators to suggest it has stabilized and may be poised to begin more robust growth across the Company and particularly in card.

And consistent with last quarter, credit continues to be quite healthy.

 

In fact, net charge-offs are the lowest we've experienced in recent history.

On Page 2, we have some more detail.

 

Revenue of $30.4 billion was up $500 million or 2% year-on-year.

Net interest income was up 1% with Balance Sheet growth and higher rates primarily offset by mix and lower CIB Markets NII.

 

And NIR was up 3% driven by solid fee generation across investment banking and AWM largely offset by net securities losses in corporate versus gains in the prior year and lower revenue in home lending.

Expenses of 17.1 billion were up 1% year-on-year on continued investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses, predominantly offset by lower legal expense and the absence of an impairment in the prior year.

 

and credit costs were a net benefit of $1.5 billion driven by the reserve release.

But it's also worth noting that net charge-offs of just over $500 million were approximately half of last year's third-quarter number.

 

Let's cover reserves on the next page.

We released $2.1 billion this quarter driven by less severe downside scenarios as the macro environment continues to normalize.

 

Reserves stand at 20.5 billion, which still accounts for elevated uncertainties surrounding COVID, and the current labor market dynamics, including the exploration of expanded unemployment benefits.

Now moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 4, we ended the quarter with a CG1 ratio of 12.9% down modestly primarily on higher RWA.

 

The firm distributed $8 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter, including 5 billion of net repurchases and the common dividend was increased to $1 per share.

With that, let's move on to our businesses starting with Consumer and Community Banking on page 5.

 

CCB reported net income of 4.3 billion, including reserve releases of 950 million on revenue of $12.5 billion down 3% year-on-year.

Deposits were up 3% quarter-on-quarter, indicating some deceleration as excess deposits are stabilizing.

 

Notably contributing to this growth, we ranked number 1 in retail deposit share based on the FDIC data, and we're the only large bank to show meaningful share growth up 70 basis points year-on-year.

Similarly, client investment assets were up 29% year-on-year.

 

And while market performance was a driver, retail flows in both advisor and digital channels were strong.

Touching on spend, combined credit and debit spend was up 24% versus the third quarter of '19 and in line with last quarter, within that data, travel, and entertainment spend was up 8% versus 3Q '19, and very closely track the patterns of the Delta variant within the quarter, softening in August and early September, and reaccelerating in recent weeks.

 

Card outstanding’s were up 1% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter, benefiting from higher new account originations.

And while the payment rate is still very elevated, it's come down from the highs and revolving balances have stabilized.

 

And when we look inside our data, we see evidence of excess deposits starting to normalize in segments of the population that traditionally revolve.

So as a result, we're optimistic about the growth prospects of revolving card balances.

 

Moving to home lending.

Average loans or down 6% year-on-year, but up 2% quarter-on-quarter with portfolio additions now outpacing prepayments.

 

It was another strong quarter for originations totaling nearly 42 billion, up 43% year-on-year, reflecting record purchase volume and share gains in the refi market.

And in Auto, we had 11.5 billion of originations, second only to last quarter's record.

 

So overall, loans PPP, were up 3% quarter-on-quarter on the growth in card and home lending I just mentioned Expenses 7.2 billion, were up 5% year-on-year, driven by investments in the business, including marketing.

And more generally, we continue to see that the acceleration in digital adoption during the pandemic has persisted with active mobile users up 10% year-on-year to almost 45 million.

 

So with that, looking forward, we are encouraged by our household growth and balance sheet trends.

However, we expect it to take some time for revolving credit card balances to return to pre-pandemic levels, given the amount of liquidity in the system.

 

In the meantime, credit losses and delinquencies remain extraordinary low.

In card on a year-to-date basis versus 2019, low charge-offs more than offset lower NII.

 

Next, the corporate and investment bank on Page 6, CIB reported net income of $5.6 billion on revenue of 12.4 billion.

Investment banking revenue of $3 billion was up 45% versus the prior year, and down 12%, sequentially.

 

IB fees were up 52% year-on-year, driven by strong performance in advisory and equity underwriting and we maintained our number 1 rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 9.4%.

An advisory was an all-time record quarter benefiting from the surge in M&A activity, and we almost tripled fees year on year in a market that doubled.

 

Debt underwriting fees were up 3% driven by an active leveraged loan market primarily linked to acquisition financing.

And in equity underwriting, fees were up 41% primarily driven by our strong performance and IPOs.

 

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the overall pipeline is healthy and the M&A market is expected to remain active.

And if so, IBTs should be up year-on-year, but down sequentially.

 

Moving to Markets, total revenue was 6.3 billion, down 5% compared to a record third quarter last year.

Notably, we were up 24% from 2019, driven by the continued strong performance in equities and spread products.

 

Fixed income was down 20% year-on-year due to ongoing normalization across products, particularly in commodities, as well as an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in our derivatives portfolio.

Equities was up 30%, a record third quarter, with strength across regions and, and reflecting higher balances in prime, strong client activity in cash, as well as ongoing momentum in derivatives.

 

In terms of outlook, keep in mind that it will be a difficult compare against the record fourth quarter last year.

But the current environment continues to challenge our ability to forecast revenues.

 

Wholesale payments revenue of $1.6 billion was up 22% or up 10% excluding gains on strategic equity investments.

And the year-on-year growth was driven by higher deposits and fees, partially offset by deposit margin compression.

 

Security Services revenue of 1.1 billion was up 9%, primarily driven by growth in fees on higher market levels.

Expenses of 5.9 billion or flat year-on-year as higher structural and volume and revenue-related expense, as well as investments, were offset by lower legal expense.

 

And credit costs were a net benefit of 638 million, driven by the reserve release I mentioned upfront.

Moving to commercial banking on Page 7, commercial banking reported net income of $1.4 billion, revenue of 2.5 billion was up 10% year-on-year on higher investment banking and wholesale payments revenue.

 

Record gross investment banking revenue of $1.3 billion was up 60% primarily driven by increased large deal activity with continued strength in MNA and acquisition-related financing across both corporate client and middle-market banking.

Expenses of $1 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly due to investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses.

 

Deposits were up 4% sequentially, mainly driven by higher operating balances, and loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter.

C & I loans were down 3%, but up 1%, excluding PPP, driven by higher originations.

 

And it's also worth noting that consistent with last quarter, we are seeing a slight uptick in utilization rates in middle market.

And those among larger corporates seem to have stabilized albeit at historically low levels.

 

CRE loans were flat with modestly higher originations in commercial term lending offset by net payoff activity and real estate banking.

Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of 363 million, driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of 6 basis points.

 

And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8.

Asset and Wealth Management reported net income of $1.2 billion with pretax margin of 37%, record revenue of 4.3 billion was up 21% year-on-year as higher management fees and growth in deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit margin compression.

 

Expenses of 2.8 billion were up 13% year-on-year, largely driven by higher performance-related compensation, as well as distribution fees.

For the quarter net long-term inflows of 33 billion, continue to be positive across all channels, asset classes, and regions, with notable strength in equities and fixed income.

 

AUM of $3 trillion and overall assets of $4.1 trillion, up 17% and 22% year-on-year respectively, were driven by higher market levels and strong net inflows.

And finally, loans were up 3% quarter-on-quarter, with continued strength in custom lending, securities-based lending, and mortgages.

 

While deposits were up 5% sequentially.

Turning to corporate on Page 9.

 

Corporate reported a net loss of $817 million, including 383 million of the 566 million tax benefit, that I mentioned upfront.

Revenue was a loss of $1.3 billion down 957 million year-on-year.

 

N II was a loss of 1.1 billion down 372 million, primarily unlimited deployment opportunities as deposit growth continued.

And we realized 256 million of net investment securities losses in the quarter compared to 466 million of net gains last year.

 

Expenses of a 160 million were down 559 million year-on-year, primarily driven by the absence of an impairment on a legacy investment in the prior year.

On the next page, let's discuss the outlook.

 

Our full-year outlook for 2021 remains largely in line with our previous guidance.

We still expect NII to be approximately $52.5 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $71 billion.

 

But as you'll see on the page, we've lowered our outlook for the card net charge-off rate to around 2% as delinquencies remain very low.

So to wrap up, we're pleased with this quarter's performance as we approach what we hope is the tail end of the pandemic.

 

The strengths of the Company, both in terms of our diversified business model, as well as our fortress Balance Sheet, talent and culture, have enabled us to perform well through this difficult period while continuing to serve our clients, customers, and communities.

As we look ahead and the environment normalizes, new challenges will undoubtedly arise, but we feel confident with the position of the Company and the strategy going forward.

 

With that, Operator, please open the line to Q&A.
Operator

And our first question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research.

 

John, please proceed.



John McDonald

Good morning, Jeremy.

 

Wanted to ask about the net interest income guidance for the year.

It seems to imply a nice step-up in NII for the fourth quarter to roughly 13.5 billion.

 

Was wondering what do you expect to be the drivers of that sequential step-up and would you see the fourth quarter NII as a good starting point for us to think about our 2022 NII forecasts?



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah, John.

 

Good question and good catch there.

It's true, that is quite a bit of sequential growth.

 

If you do the math, it suggests about 350 million.

And in reality, if you think about what we've been saying about the outlook for increased revolving and deployment and so on, The increase is non-intuitively high.

 

And so just to explain within that, there are a couple of factors.

So one, there's actually a meaningful amount of markets and our growth between the third and the fourth quarter, which in general we would sort of encouraging you to ignore.

 

And there's also some sequential increase in NII from PPP forgiveness contributing to the fourth quarter number.

If you strip those two out, you still see a little bit of modest growth, which is a little bit more consistent, I think with the overall story that we've been tying, which is that the real acceleration in NII, especially from higher card revolve, is a 2022 item.

 

In that context, then if you take that sort of lower number and thinking about annualizing that, I think it's fair to assume that that would be a lower-end estimate for the 2022 number in light of what we believe will happen in terms of -- especially card revolve.

But obviously, we'll give you a little bit more color about 2022, next quarter.

 



John McDonald

Okay.

 

And as a follow-up, your cash balances continue to grow and you have been conservative on liquidity appointments, could you update us on your thinking around liquidity deployment, pacing that, and what factors you're balancing?



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah, totally.

 

At the highest level, I would say that nothing's really changed, meaning we're still all else equal, happy to be patient.

We still believe in a robust global recovery.

 

We still are a little bit concerned about inflation, I think relative to the consensus.

And all of that contributes to a willingness to be relatively patient about deployment.

 

But it's also fair to say, that relative to last quarter, rates are obviously higher.

We start to see central banks around the world normalizing their policy stance a little bit, so the market-implied rates are coming a little bit more in line with our view and given that, it wouldn't be surprising if we saw some more opportunities for front-end deployment, cash, and cash-like activity, as well as possibly some duration management.

 



John McDonald

Got it.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Our next question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities.

 

Please, proceed.



Jim Mitchell

Hey.

 

Good morning.

Just first on loan growth.

 

As you noted, the auto has been a strong card starting to show signs of life, but it looks like outside of acquisition, finance, C &I still seems a little weak and we've got ongoing supply chain issues.

I don't know, as we think about the big picture, how are you seeing, I guess loan demand trends playing out, and what are you expecting as the next 12 months progresses?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

So let's go through loan growth because obviously, that's one of the areas that everyone's interested in.

And so if we start with a card, which is obviously the one that's going to amount of the most in terms of NII impact, as you said, we see some signs of life and we believe that recovery is strongly underway and it seems hopeful like Delta is really fading so that's going to help.

 

If you just look forward just to the holiday season, we would expect to see normal seasonality, normal growth there.

And the question really for Card as we've talked about a lot is whether that growth in spend and in Card outstanding translates into Revolve.

 

But as I noted in the prepared remarks, when we look inside the data and we look at the customers who have both deposit accounts with us and our Card customers, and we look at those who would typically be the ones that are most inclined to Revolve, we actually do see slightly faster spend down of the excess deposit balances there.

So that makes us relatively optimistic about both the potential for card outstanding to grow with the higher spending, but also for increased revolve and lower pay rates as we go into next year.

 

It's going to take time obviously, but that is the core view.

In-home lending, broadly, we expected this quarter's trend with portfolio additions outpacing prepayments to continue.

 

And then in C&I, which you mentioned, just a reminder, that as you go to the higher end of the spectrum in terms of the size of the C&I customers were eager to lend to them as a key part of the franchise.

But from a financial performance perspective, that's more of an outcome rather than a goal.

 

But we do, as I noted up front, see a little bit of an uptick in utilization rates amongst smaller corporates.

So that's consistent with a theme that we've been seeing, which is that the smaller you are, the less likely you are to have benefited from the wide-open Capital Markets, the more likely you are to be borrowing.

 

We do hear a lot about supply chain issues from that customer segment.

So it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out.

 

And then in CRE, we see quite a robust origination pipeline, as we've fully removed any pandemic-related credit pullbacks, and we're leaning into that and we do expect to see a little bit of net loan growth going forward.

And then finally, I would note that we do see some loan growth in markets actually, and we generally discourage you from focusing too much on NII and loan growth within markets, but it is an indicator that there are some opportunities there that we're taking advantage of, in the usual kind of nimble way that you would expect us to do in markets.

 



Jim Mitchell

Okay.

 

That's all very helpful.

And maybe just a follow-up on the expense side.

 

You and your peers have all seen higher expenses this year, higher capital markets, and incentive expenses, and increased investment spend.

But as we think about going into next year, our capital markets activity normalizes as many expect.

 

Can we start to see expense growth slow or are there other considerations to think about whether it's investment spend or inflation pressures that we should think about?



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

So it's a little bit of an all-of-the-above story I would say.

So first of all, we're still in the middle of budgeting and it's sort of a little early to be giving you 2022 expense guidance.

 

We'll do more of that next quarter, but realistically, expenses are going to be up next year.

Now, to your point about capital markets-related expenses, it's obviously true that we pay for performance and in light of the very strong performance over the last couple of years in both Banking and Markets, we have seen increased compensation expense on the way up.

 

And therefore, as a function of the amount of normalization that you see in 2022, you're going to see that come down in line all else equal.

Obviously, I would point out, that I think that the amount of growth in that number that we've seen through the pandemic, is less than a lot of people would have expected, actually.

 

And therefore, on the way back down, you would also potentially expect less participation, not to mention just the timing dynamics associated with the treatment of stock-based compensation investing.

So all of that aside, at the same time, we are still investing.

 

We still see significant opportunities.

We still see marketing opportunities in the card, and yeah, labor inflation is a question.

 

You saw us raise wages in parts of the U.S.

at the entry level.

 

That just came into effect this September.

And as we look out, we see a lot of churns.

 

And as Jamie was saying, it's good stuff, it's normal, it's understandable in this environment, but labor inflation is definitely a watch item for us.

So when you put all that stuff together, as I said, we'll update you more next quarter, but that's how we see the expense outlook for next year.

 



Jim Mitchell

Okay.

 

Great.

That's helpful.

 

Thanks.

Next question is coming from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities.

 

Your line is open.

Please proceed.

 



Mike Mayo

Hi, there are a couple of events during the quarter that I wanted to ask about, and specifically, how has the tech strategy evolved?

 

One, you made the announcement that you're changing the retail bank core system entirely to the public cloud.

and that's a big change.

 

And Jamie, I would love to hear your comments on that.

And then second, your expansion in the UK with digital banking, what metrics are you shooting for?

 

And third, your recent Fintech acquisitions to what degree are there synergies among the acquisitions in addition to JPMorgan?

Thanks.

Okay, Mike.

 

Hang on.

I'm writing doing your questions because I don't want to lose track.

 

Let's start with the Cloud first.

Yeah, you will have seen some press coverage around our partnership with Thought Machine.

 

At a high level, there's actually nothing new here.

We've actually been committed to the Cloud for a long time.

 

And by the way, when I say Cloud, I think we're talking about both private and public Cloud.

Our core strategy involves really leaning into both and being very nimble across both.

 

And I think that's very important for us as a regulated institution from our resiliency perspective.

But the reasons, for do -- and that's all part of our overall tech monetization road map.

 

And a lot of the investments that we're doing that you've heard all the leadership of the Company talk about.

When it comes to Thought Machine in the consumer space, There are five main reasons why we did that and it's all the normal reasons why you do cloud stuff and you do tech monetization.

 

We want to be able to innovate quickly and bring custom products to consumers faster.

We want to be able to run multiple products on the same platform.

 

As I mentioned, resiliency is critical.

Increasingly, we want to be able to run the bank much more in real-time rather than based on batch processes.

 

And obviously, APIs are central to the entire strategy in this environment.

So that's what I would say about that.

 

Now -- yes, Jamie.



Jamie Dimon

Thought Machine is, basically, the core general ledger.

 

It's not all the other stuff around the consumer.

And when you do these conversions different than conversions in the past, you can do them -- you could schedule pieces, do part at a time, not all at once, like a big bang, which we used to have to do when we did big merge and stuff like that.

 

So it's -- put it at a lower risk for the Company.

But the core strategy hasn't changed at all.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

Okay.

And then Mike, international consumer and acquisitions, I think you asked about.

 

So in terms of international consumers, you will have seen that we launched -- it's obviously early days to give meaningful updates on that, but you will have noted actually that we've just rebranded NutMeg as a JPMorgan Company just a couple of days ago.

So all that's proceeding at pace and it seems to be pretty well received.

 

I think the offering has seen us differentiated and innovative, so we'll have more to say about that over time.

Generally --

 



Jamie Dimon

I just again, this is -- this is a 10-year game plan.

 

This is not, they're going to worry that much about metrics in the next month or two.

And with this the long-term work to try to get this thing right because if we're ever going to be retail overseas, it's going to be digital.

 

And so we're going to be very patient.

and at one point Mike, we will report some metrics so you can see them, but they're not going to be material to the firm's numbers for years.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

That's going to take time for sure.

So -- but just more generally, in terms of the acquisition strategy, we've talked about this a little bit before.

 

We're not claiming that we have some overarching top-down acquisition strategy.

I think broadly we are just doing things that make sense.

 

But there are some themes that you can detect around bolt-on and adding capabilities.

If -- just for the sake of argument, if you start with AWM, you'll see a pretty consistent theme in there of ESG related capability additions.

 

You've mentioned already international expansion and the potential for growth, and it will be a long game, as Jamie says.

And then, yeah, there's definitely a fintech narrative a little bit in terms of some of the stuff that we've done in the CIB.

 

And then within the consumer, most recently, the collection of things that we've done I think is unified by the theme of providing more integrated and holistic experiences to our customers.

We've always been very proud of the value proposition that we offer, especially in the Card product.

 

But we think we can take it up another notch with some of the stuff that we're doing around lounges and CX loyalty and stuff like that.

I think I touched on everything there, Mike.

 



Mike Mayo

That you certainly did.

 

And just as a follow-up, we see the results, the marginal efficiency in the businesses where you're growing has improved.

And we just don't have the why.

 

So how much of that is tech-driven versus other reasons that I guess you have metrics internally that we just don't have.

But your, your marginal efficiency is what or your unit costs are going down or any additional color as to why the marginal efficiency is improving?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

I mean, I think reasonable people can differ on how you talk about this stuff, especially in terms of what parts of the expensive space to see us a little bit more fixed versus a little bit more floating.

I would've said that in reality, marginal expense increases as a function of most types of marginal revenue are actually lower than a lot of people think.

 

So the operating leverage that you see, especially in the type of environment that we've had with really big increases in revenue on the capital markets areas and on the NRR site is actually relatively consistent with what I would've expected, but a little bit to your point, Mike, what's also true is that we're a big organization.

There's a scale play here.

 

We have a big fixed cost base and a lot of the modernization agenda is about making sure that that doesn't creep and that it's as expensive as possible so that it can be as nimble as possible.

And that marginal efficiency over time is as good as possible.

 

But that's a long play there.



Mike Mayo

All right.

 

Thank you.



Jamie Dimon

And Mike, one of the things you think about, one is you people worried about the forecast for next year and stuff like that.

 

We're playing the game for ten years here.

So we're going to -- and we're not going to disclose certain things, like, margin byproduct or something like that because it's competitive information.

 

But in the long game, we're competing with some very large, talented, global players, who are not even in banking today.

And we are going to compete in that.

 

So even some of these acquisitions are more around that, than around what I consider traditional banking.

And so -- in my whole life, just so you know, we've been modernizing technology, Every year of every month of every quarter, that's like a permanent state of affairs.

 

Obviously, now it's to the Cloud and stuff like that.

Those things are critical to do to be competitive going forward.

 

That was true, by the way, 20 years ago.



Mike Mayo

Got it.

 

Thanks.

Next up, we have a question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.

 

Your line is open.

Please, proceed.

 



Ken Usdin

Thanks.

 

Good morning.

I wanted to ask if you can expand a little bit more upon card fees and card revenue rate.

 

We all certainly expected the marketing expenses to go up inside that line.

And just wondering if you can help us understand how much of that was captured in the third quarter and just what your general outlook is for the fee line and the underlying overall revenue rate.

 

Thank you.



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

Ken.

You're right.

 

Part of the drop in the revenue rate this quarter is a function of higher card marketing spend, which you would have expected.

As a result of what we said last quarter in terms of the importance of getting our fair share of the growth and spending as we emerge from the pandemic and the fact that we're out in the market with a lot of offers that are seeing good uptake and we're seeing nice growth there.

 

So that's expected.

And I think that card marketing number will actually remain elevated.

 

And if anything ticks up a little bit sequentially, just based on how the amortization there works.

So you should expect to see that continue.

 

But in addition, this quarter we have an adjustment to the rewards liability, which is contributing to the drop this quarter as well.

So that is not something that we see continuing.

 

So that should come out of the run rate as we look forward.



Ken Usdin

Can you help us understand what the magnitude of that is and what you think about the overall Card revenue rate going forward?

 



Jeremy Barnum

I mean, we don't really manage the Card revenue rate, so it's not a number that I'm eager to guide to.

 

But I think the -- if I remember correctly, I think the rewards liability adjustment this quarter was of the order of something like 180 million, so we'll confirm that, but I think that's right.



Ken Usdin

Okay.

 

Thanks.

If I might just ask Jamie, you made a comment yesterday about the supply chain hopefully easing by next year around this time.

 

What are you just hearing from your partners around the world in terms of the logjams and the potential for that to open up from here?



Jamie Dimon

I'm not hearing much different than you're hearing.

 

I'm just -- I know that the over-focus over time is so extraordinary sometimes in the press, that people forget the big picture.

The economy's going 4 or 5%.

 

What people are buying is changed, which has also hurt supply chains a little bit.

There's not one Company I know who's not working aggressively to fix the supply chain issues.

 

Sales are still up, credit card debit card spends still up because it was in great shape.

And capitalism works.

 

I doubt we'll be talking about supply chain stuff in a year.

I just think that [Indiscernible] we're focusing on too much is simply dampening a fairly good economy.

 

It's not reversing a fairly good economy.



Ken Usdin

Got it.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Next up, we have a question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.

 

Please, proceed.



Betsy Graseck

Hi.

 

I have 2 questions: one, just following up on the Card discussion that we just have regarding the fees and the 180 million on the -- roughly 180 million on the rewards adjustment.

I mean, it still leaves us with a pretty big decline in Q-on-Q.

 

And I'm just trying to think through that a little bit because I know marketing rewards, etc, is up.

But was there anything, in particular, that would have driven a one-timer that is unlikely to persist or not?

 

I realize that cashback is a little more expensive, so maybe that's a piece of it and it's a one-time move or is it more a function of, hey, we're going to be ramping our offerings here.

And so you should expect that the forward-look is a step-down from what you had been seeing in 2Q?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

So Betsy, in short, it's really the latter.

So the only thing that is one-time - ish in nature, for lack of a better term, is the rewards liability adjustment.

 

And the rest of it really is marketing spend.

And we see that as a critical investment at this moment to moment of high engagement with the product, and we're very committed to making those investments.

 

And so that is going to remain elevated.

And if anything, tick off a little bit as we look forward.

 



Betsy Graseck

Okay.

 

Thanks.

And then separately, I think today is the last day of the Vice-Chair of Supervision, Randy Quarles as Vice-Chair of [Indiscernible] and so the question is, how should we be thinking about how you are positioning for an environment where maybe these rules don't change, right?

 

Like the LCR, the SLR, other things that we had been hoping might have some changes in them.

Should we be anticipating that in order to help deliver the growth that you're looking for, that we should anticipate more pref issuance going forward?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

So I think, obviously, we're a little disappointed that we haven't seen some of the changes on the non-risk sensitive size-based constraints that we'd expected, but we're still hopeful that that will come soon.

We know the staff is hard at work on the [Indiscernible] endgame, and that's complicated stuff and it may be the case that some of those things are connected.

 

And our strategy on pref issuance has been to try to balance giving ourselves the capacity that we want to deal with the SLR constrain, without over issuing and therefore being stuck with a high-cost product that isn't callable for 5 years.

So that's part of the reason why we're operating a little bit above our CET1 target right now, and we're just going to continue to be nimble in that respect.

 
Operator

Thanks.

 

Next up, a question from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.

Your line proceeds.

 



Glenn Schorr

Hi.

 

Thanks very much.

So in the spirit of your thought on not overly focusing on the near-term.

 

Did I hear your comments on payment rates and cards for [Indiscernible] seasonality, optimism about revolving card balances.

So is there an implicit comment within there about buying now, pay later, and the impact it may or may not have?

 

I'd love to get your perspective on hand this old, but I guess a new payment option might have on the cards industry overall.

Thanks.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

Thanks, Glenn.

So BNPL, everyone's talking about it.

 

It is funny how layaway is back in the e-commerce checkout land.

But -- and obviously, we're looking at it.

 

Everyone is talking about it and it's a moment for us as a Company where even though for any given thing that's emerging, you can easily convince yourself that it's kind of not a threat.

We're in a moment of taking all types of potential disruptions, especially [Indiscernible] type disruptions quite seriously.

 

And in the case of BNPL, it's obviously particularly high profile because of the growth that we've seen, although it's a relatively small portion of the overall market.

I will remind you that we have our own very compelling offerings that speak directly to the installment payment experience in the form of My Chase Loan and My Chase Plan, which we get really good feedback on the customer experience there in terms of the post-purchase experience.

 

You can select eligible purchases on the app and then move that to an installment plan if you want.

But yeah, we acknowledge that it is downstream of the point-of-sale, which potentially raises some questions about whether we should be looking at moving a little bit more upstream there.

 

But even more generally when you take a step back, what we're really trying to do in the consumer business here, is think about what is the actual customer need that is driving the growth and BNPL and how can we respond to it in a strategic holistic way across all of our customers, and not too narrowly and too reactively, just respond to BNPL, but it's, obviously, a thing that we're looking at it and it's quite interesting.



Jamie Dimon

I think it's another example of growth in the Company.

 

You saw a firm come out and it's no longer just about BNPL.

They're going to have a debit card and attached banking accounts.

 

So these are all different forms of competition which we have to respond to.

And so that's why when we talked about, like, expenses, we will spend whatever we have to spend to compete with all these folks in our space.

 



Glenn Schorr

I appreciate all that.

 

Maybe one mother comment or get your thought on the right perspective to think about China and Evergrande and what people care about most is, is there an expansion across the border, meaning, is this a contained within their market?

Are the funders, that will have some marks within their market, or do you see any domino effect in crossing borders?

 

Thanks.



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

So look, obviously, everyone is looking at Evergrande.

Let me start by just saying that, for us, in terms of direct Evergrande exposure is absolute de minimis.

 

So that's one piece.

As you would expect, we've also looked at more indirect exposures in terms of the broad China property sector, as well as exposures of financial institutions that we deal with, to the China property sector, and in general, those exposures are all very modest.

 

So we're, obviously, watching it closely and continuing to look for reading across and do what you would expect us to do, but we're not terribly concerned right now about the impact on us.

I think, in terms of cross-border contagion, I don't hold my own opinion on this in particularly high regard, but it does seem like this was pretty well telegraphed by the Chinese authorities when they talked about their three red lines.

 

So it's a process that's being managed.

And I would say the better view right now is that it will be contained.

 

But of course, it's the market, so we'll see what happens.



Glenn Schorr

Thanks for all that, Jeremy.

 

Thanks.
Operator

Next up, we have a question from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

 

Please proceed.



Ebrahim Poonawala

Good morning.

 

I guess just wanted to follow up on two things that were discussed; one around FinTechs and the regulatory changes, a lot of focus on the change in leadership at the regulatory agencies.

Jamie, you've talked about in the past in terms of regulatory arbitrage, when you look at big tech non-bank players, I think BNPL is a good example of that.

 

Do you think as we have new leadership at the regulatory agencies, they're alert to this arbitrage, and do you think we see a clampdown, or is it too late for really them to create a framework that would level the playing field?



Jamie Dimon

I don't expect that there will be beneficial changes that help banks.

 

And, I think, that we just have to compete with what we're -- the hand we're dealt, and not expect anything like that.

And I think that you're going to have some people clamp down more in banks and maybe some people regulate fintech based on products or service, something like that.

 

But I'm not expecting any relief.



Ebrahim Poonawala

Good.

 

Yeah.

and I was just wondering if there would be increased scrutiny of the non-bank players then it's good to banks, but point noted.

 

And I guess, just on a separate question, Jeremy, we didn't see any building the CET1 when I look at the numerator, anything going on there this quarter that impacted it?

And with the stock rate is at 2.4 times tangible, just remind us of how important are buybacks here, and opposed to just keeping some dry powder as the economy gets better?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

So, the answer to how important buybacks are that they're at the end of our capital hierarchy we often say, right.

So organic growth, including acquisitions, sustainable dividends, and only then do we look at buybacks.

 

And in light of the SCB environment that we're in, where we don't have a Fed-approved buyback plan anymore and we just simply have to comply with the minimums and BAU, that gives us quite a bit of nimbleness, which is an important thing to preserve in light of a world



Jeremy Barnum

where we do hope for loan growth next year and where acquisitions are still potentially on the horizon.

 

So nothing really going on in this quarter other than a little bit of RWA growth in the denominator and we're just really going to stay nimble there.



Ebrahim Poonawala

But is there a case to be made, Jamie, in terms of just holding some dry-powder in excess capital given your macro outlook, as opposed to buying back stock at current valuations?

 



Jamie Dimon

Yeah, I [Indiscernible] evaluations -- as the stock goes up, you're going to -- you should expect to one day buy less.

 

And we don't need dry powder, we have an extraordinary amount of capital liquidity.

I mean extraordinary, and we earned 40 billion pre-tax a year.

 

I mean, how much dry powder do you need?

We have $1.6 trillion of cash and marketable securities.

 

We have 200 -- well over 200 billion of equity.

We can issue prefers, we can issue debt, we can issue stock if we had to do something.

 

So I don't think we need dry powder.

I think our capital cup runneth over where it is.

 



Ebrahim Poonawala

Noted.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Next one is from Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research.

 

Please proceed.



Steven Chubak

Good morning.

 

So, Jeremy, you provided some helpful detail on the drivers of loan growth by category.

Just looking ahead, is your expectation that loan growth begins to keep pace with GDP or economic growth?

 

Or is there anything that would actually justify more meaningful acceleration lending activity, whether it's just greater pent-up loan demand, normalization of the card payment rates, or something else?



Jeremy Barnum

Good question, Steve.

 

But I think you're sort of potentially leading me into giving fairly detailed loan growth guidance for 2022, which I -- I'm not really in a position to do.

But let me see if I can answer this at a high level.

 

I mean, we've talked a lot about Spend, which we believe in, driving Card loans higher, so that's one piece.

And the Revolve story within that as a function of the spend down and cash buffers, especially in our revolver -- the revolving segment of our customers.

 

And obviously, as you know well if you think about our NII as the sum product of the NIM and the outstandings in the various loan categories, it is really disproportionately Card that drives things.

In the meantime, if you move a little bit away from consumer to the larger wholesale system.

 

In a world where, even if tapering sorts relatively soon, if that plays out over roughly 8 months at $15 billion of decrease a month, you still, if you do the math, wind up with another $0.5 trillion of QE.

So we're dealing with a system that has a lot of surplus liquidity.

 

And so in that context, realistically, it's hard to imagine seeing a lot of wholesale loan growth at a minimum.

But.

 

frankly, that's not really a big driver of performance for us.

So I don't know if that helps,

 



Jeremy Barnum

but it's a good question.

 



Steven Chubak

Thanks, Jeremy.

 

It absolutely helps.

And just one clarifying question on the [Indiscernible] commentary.

 

You noted this quarter's result included an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in the derivatives portfolio.

So maybe you can help unpack what that adjustment actually entails, what prompted it, and could you help size the impact in the quarter?

 



Jeremy Barnum

I could help unpack it, but it would take another 20 minutes which we don't really have.

 

It's just bog-standard liquidity evaluation type stuff in the derivatives book in terms of as we revise our assumptions about what the potential transaction costs would be associated with transferring certain types of positions.

It's normal course stuff that just happened to be a little bit bigger.

 

I think fixed income was down 20% and I think without that it would have been down 15%.

So if that helps.

 



Steven Chubak

Very helpful.

 

Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator

Next question is from Matthew O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.

 

Please proceed.



Matthew O’Connor

Hey guys.

 

I was hoping to follow up on the capacity to deploy liquidity.

And, I guess, it's to lead it a little bit.

 

If we look at the growth in deposits, and I know some of them are considered non-core, but take out the loan growth and the growth in the securities book since COVID.

It's not about an extra 500 billion of deposits.

 

And how much of that do you think can be deployed into securities?

And understanding that you expect loan growth to pick up.

 

So that'll go to some.

But is there a way to a size that 500 billion capacity in terms of buying securities?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

So I think there's a lot of factors that play into what the deployment decision is at any given moment.

Obviously, as you said, loan growth, but also we will always make these decisions on the long-term economic basis, not for the purpose of generating short-term NII.

 

And so when you do that, you have to think about capital volatility, drawdowns, and frankly, whether or not you see the value.

And that if anything is probably the biggest single factor right now.

 

As I talked about earlier,



Jeremy Barnum

it is true that the market has come a little bit more in line with our views, at least from a rate perspective.

 

And that may lead to a little bit more deployment, all else equal right now.

but when you start talking about spread product, for example, in light of the liquidity environment that we're in and the QE numbers that I mentioned a second ago, that remains very, very compressed, and there's just not a lot of value there.

 

So we always try to be long-term economically motivated there, considering all the scenarios, considering risk management, considering the convexity of the balance sheet, and looking at value and being tactical there.

So that's really how I would think about that.

 



Matthew O’Connor

I mean, I just did on a near-term basis, but I think a lot of investors are sitting here saying if the 10-year or really any part of that curve hits that magic point for you, what is this at capacity?

 

So for example, if the 10-year gets to say 3%, and your confidence is not going to go to 5, do you have 100 billion at capacity, is it 300 billion?

Just any way to frame it longer-term appreciating that it's not what you're looking to do at this moment at these levels.

 



Jeremy Barnum

No, I get the question.

 



Jamie Dimon

We could easily do 200 billion.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

I mean, I get the question.

I get why you want to know, I guess, I just think, for a Company of our sophistication and given how carefully we think about this stuff, the idea of a particular target at which we would deploy a particular amount.

 

Of course, Jamie is right, but it's always going to be situational, it's always going to be a function of why the rate is where it is.

I mean, in your question you alluded to it, it's like if the 10-year note's at 3, and we're sure it's not going to 5, but then where's the rest of the yield curve, what are the other options, what's going on in that moment.

 

So we're always going to be situational and tactical about it.



Matthew O’Connor

That's helpful.

 

And then kind of squeeze in, you've announced a bunch of what most of us have characterized as relatively small acquisitions, some this quarter and obviously, looking back for the full year.

Is there something that -- is there a way you could kind of size the capital impact of that?

 

I know most of the terms weren't disclosed individually, but any way to frame the capital and financial impact?

And then just lastly, remind us, what is the driving force when you look for a deal?

 

Because some of the deals you look at and you're like how does that fit into broader JPMorgan Chase?

Thank you.

 



Jamie Dimon

The capital impact in total isn't that big a deal and we're not going to disclose any more nor is the immediate financial impact.

 

And each one is different.

So in Consumer, Jeremy already said, it's more about lifestyle, travel, lounges, millennial, stuff like that.

 

In asset management of products, there was [Indiscernible] products, ESG products, timber products, stuff like that.

And then between NutMeg and C6 and stuff like that, that is a longer-term view of us trying to get positioned into retail overseas over 10 years if we can.

 



Matthew O’Connor

Great.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Next one is coming from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets.

 

Please proceed.



Gerard Cassidy

Thank you.

 

Good morning.

Jeremy, you were saying that -- when we were talking earlier about the potential SLR changes and such, and we haven't seen anything in [Indiscernible] leaving today.

 

But you mentioned about maybe the [Indiscernible] is focus on the Basel III end game, that's coming very soon here.

Can you share with us from your guy's perspective, what are you focusing on with the Basel III final rules and regulations that could affect your growth going forward?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

So I think, I mean, the thing about the Basel III End Game is that you need to essentially deal simultaneously with the Basel floors -- the Basel standardized floors and the Collins floor.

So you need to simultaneously -- so from the perspective of the staff that's working on this stuff, they have a tough challenge to simultaneously put in place the U.S.

 

rule, which is Basel compliant, while also complying with the Collins floor standardized or WA minimum.

And so that's complicated and it's hard and it's quite technical and that sort of explains why it's taking a little bit longer than we might have all otherwise thought.

 

In terms of the impact of that on our long-term growth, I mean at a high level, it's unlikely to be significant.

I think the related point is whether or not there are some changes as part of that or contemporaneously with that to these non-risk sensitive size-based constraints like G7 SLR, where obviously, most prominently in the case of GSIB, it's really getting pretty extreme in terms of the growth in the score for reasons that really have nothing to do with what the original design of the metric was.

 

And to a very significant degree are driven by the expansion of the system that we've seen in the last 18 months.

So that's why we believe that that should be addressed as was contemplated in the original role.

 

And so across all of those potential changes, you could see us doing a little bit of optimization in response to those.

You can imagine that Basel III endgame in terms of standardized and advanced and the impact on different products might make some things a little bit more capital efficient and others a little bit less capital efficient at the margin.

 

But we're a big diversified Company.

We're pretty good at navigating this stuff.

 

So when we have clarity, we'll make the necessary tweaks.



Gerard Cassidy

Very good.

 

Thank you.

And then obviously, you in the industry have seen really good deposit growth on a year-over-year basis.

 

I think your deposits are up 20% all-in.

You talked specifically about retail being the number one market share and retail deposits.

 

When the Fed ends QE, assuming it does some time by the middle of next year, and I'm not asking you guys to forecast what your deposits are going to be, but just higher level, should we anticipate that deposits could actually decline?

Or know that they are going to be so sticky even with the liquidity that everybody carriers, that we shouldn't really see a decline in deposits after QE, and this, let's call it second half, for next year?

 



Jeremy Barnum

I think there's a couple of factors in here.

 

So let's, for the sake of argument, set our RP aside for a second and hold that constant -- if you just look at the impact of QE on system-wide deposits, we talked about tapering, but as I said earlier, tapering still involves another 0.5 trillion of system expansion between now and the end of tapering, or rather between the start of tapering and the end of tapering.

If the Fed follows the same type of trajectory that it followed last time, there would be an extended pause between the end of QE and the beginning of QT.

 

And again, setting our IPO aside for a second, it would only really be with the beginning of QT that you would expect the size of the system deposit base to start shrinking, and I think the timing the last time if I remember correctly, was something like 22 months between the end of QE and the beginning of QT.

Now, of course, RP could bounce around and there could be other factors, but at a high level, that's how we're thinking about it.

 



Gerard Cassidy

Thank you.

 



Jamie Dimon

I will just add my two cents.

 

I think that they'll have to go quicker than that, and they'll have to reverse some of it.

So you're talking about we're still going to increase deposits for a year, and then there will be a fairly large reduction over a 2 or 3-year period, which we should be prepared for.

 



Gerard Cassidy

Thank you.

Yes.

 

Good morning.

I wanted to get a progress report on your new headquarter building.

 

Specifically, what's the projected move-in date, or has that been affected by the pandemic?

Secondly, are there costs, noticeable costs, running through 2021, expense structure for that build-out?

 

And does that tick up noticeably when you move in?

And then thirdly, what's the plan for unloading the properties that you'll be vacating and how is that being affected by the current real estate market?

 

Thank you.



Jeremy Barnum

So the plan is on schedule moving date 20, I think 2025.

 

There is no material expense, of course, it's duplicate expenses and we got to sell the building, stuff like that, but nothing material to our shareholder.

We need to disclose.

 

Operator, are there any other questions?
Operator

Yes, sir.

 

That is coming from [Indiscernible] from Societe Generale.

Please proceed.

 



Andrew Lim

Hi, good morning.

 

Thanks for taking my questions.

So you put, Jamie, about how you all focusing on inflation.

 

Just wondering if you could outline what you're looking at exactly metric-wise across your businesses to signal to you that inflation is actually materializing with the concern.

And how will that payout versus your expectations?

 

In terms of, like, how we deal with this if it does materialize as concerned, is there anything that you can do to try and protect the bank against inflationary forces there?



Jamie Dimon

Yeah, I think we should look at the big picture here, which, I think, is always important.

 

I mean, 2 years ago we were facing COVID, virtually a great depression, global pandemic.

And that's all in the back mirror, which is good.

 

So by hopefully a year from now, there will be no supply chain problems.

The pandemic will become endemic.

 

and I think it's very good to have good healthy growth, which we have.

And it'll be good to have unemployment of 4%, it's good that their jobs are open, I think it's good that wages went up [Indiscernible], and I think there's too much focus on -- and none of these changes how we run the business, which to we add clients all the time.

 

Consumer, card, auto, deposits, real estate, small business, large companies, and stuff like that, which is the underlying thing to drive JPMorgan.

It's not whether they take your revolver from 25% to 27%.

 

So having said all that, and I'm not focused on inflation; we simply have pointed out -- well, you have [Indiscernible] inflation.

It's 4%.

 

It's been 4% now for the better part of a couple of quarters and it's, in my view, unlikely to be lower than that next quarter or the quarter after that.

Another question is, does it start to ease after that with supply chains and wages?

 

More people looking for work or does it continue to go up?

And of course, we prepare for probabilities and eventualities and one of those probabilities is that it might go higher than people think and they'll have to tamp down.

 

I doubt that will happen before late 2022.

In the meantime, I think it's unbelievable that we're getting out of this and we have 4% unemployment, and you can have good growth with some inflation, and that's okay.

 

I think that people are always focusing too much on immediate concerns.

If you have inflation of 4% or 5%, we're still going to open deposit accounts, checking accounts, and grow our business.

 

I also should point out because it's always in the back of my mind, about $30 billion of revenues, 20 billion in subscription revenues.

Asset Management, commercial banking, consumer banking, which are pretty good.

 

Wholesale payments, security services, custody, and so we're pretty crowded with the people who've accomplished all this, that if you look at the actual underlying numbers to getting earnings per second, more customers, more accounts, more share.

And at the end of the day, that is what drives everything.

 



Andrew Lim

Okay.

 

That's great.

It seems like you're taking a benign view, and it's manageable, it's not going to get out of hand.

 

Which is fair enough.



Jamie Dimon

It's not -- I'm telling you.

 

I don't -- I'm sorry, [Indiscernible] I don't know.

We're prepared for all eventualities.

 

There may be effect Gelb inflation.

And the one other thing about our balance sheet, you guys talked about, putting your stuff like that.

 

One of the stack tails of banks do, that are banks should be worried about is high inflation and high rates.

And we have been very liquid, protects us more than against that and other things.

 



Andrew Lim

Right, got it.

 

Thanks for the clarity on that.

And just a short follow-on question, Remy.

 

Could you update us on the number of excess provisions you've got versus your base case economics scenario, you've given that number in the past and perhaps a bit of color more so on how that base case has changed over the quarter if it has indeed?



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

I think the base case -- the central case has probably actually gotten a tiny bit worse quarter-on-quarter in light of the revisions and GDP outlook.

But as you know, the framework also involves looking at probability-weighted scenarios.

 

And as I said in the prepared remarks, the less extreme downside scenarios contributed a bit to the release this quarter.

In terms of sizing the overall balance, again, as I said in the prepared remarks, they remain a little bit elevated relative to what they would be if we had this type of economic performance with none of the COVID -related unusual features, i.e.

 

uncertainty about the virus as much as we are optimistic about that right now, or uncertainty about labor market conditions, or the fact that even though a lot of the -- essentially all the federal level unemployment assistance has now rolled off and most of the states have too.

There are still some forms of assistance.

 

The mortgage foreclosure moratorium, student loan stuff, rent moratoria, stuff like that, that don't roll off until later in the year.

So there's a number of factors in the environment that are still unusual, which do contribute to slightly elevated reserves relative to what we would otherwise have.

 

And as things play out, those will develop.



Jamie Dimon

Jeremy, just to interrupt real quickly.

 

I got to go because I am out of town I have meetings I have to go to.

You guys should continue and folks, thanks for listening to us and we'll talk to you all soon.

 



Jeremy Barnum

All right.

 

Thanks, Jamie.
Operator

And by that, we have no further questions waiting.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Square Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.

 

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Nikhil Dixit, Head of Investor Relations.

Please go ahead.

 



Nikhil Dixit

Hi, everyone.

 

Thanks for joining our third quarter 2021 earnings call.

We have Jack and Amrita with us today.

 

We will begin a call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions.

During Q&A, we will take questions from our customers in addition to questions from conference call participants.

 

We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call.

Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements.

 

Recorded results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.

Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ.

 

Also note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date.

We disclaim any obligation to update the forward-looking statements except as required by law.

 

During this call, we will provide preliminary gross profit growth results for the month of October.

These represent our current estimate for October performance, as we have not yet closed our accounting financials for the month of October and our monthly results are not subject to interim review by our auditors.

 

As a result, actual October results may differ from these estimates.

Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call.

 

The reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website.

These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.

 

Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website.

An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly.

 

With that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.



Jack Dorsey

Thank you all for your time today.

 

In our seller ecosystem, we continue to build upon our omnichannel capability and those efforts have enabled us to attract and retain larger sellers while also helping our existing sellers grow our market.

This quarter, we enhanced our square invoices product to help sellers more efficiently run their business.

 

Square invoices enables sellers to easily build clients and get paid quickly, in person, online or over the phone.

In the third quarter, we introduced Square Invoices Plus, a new subscription product with more advanced features designed for larger and more complex businesses.

 

We also continue to expand our geographic reach, launching a full stack of integrated seller tools in France in September,, our most robust market launch yet.

French businesses can now sell online and in person with Square's integrated suite of products, including Square Point of Sale, Square For Restaurants, Square Online, Square Terminal, Square Stand, Square Reader and more.

 

We're excited about France given its strong small business environment, increased usage in contactless payments and it's fast growing eCommerce sector.

Switching to Cash App, we reached some major milestone in this quarter in expanding our offerings to families by serving teams and entirely new demographic for Cash App.

 

With this launch customers in the US between the ages of 13 and 17 get access to Cash Apps, massive P2P network, the cash card, direct deposit and boost, all with parental or guardian approval.

By lowering the age barrier, we hope to expand access to the financial system to 20 million teams in the US and equip them with the tools they need to participate in the cashless economy, which is especially important now, as transacting with physical cash becomes less relevant in the increasingly digital world.

 

With Cash App, families can help their teams learn about how to manage the money they earn from the allowance, jobs and chores with the appropriate protections in place.

As we've talked about, our string flies in our ecosystem model, especially as our ecosystems connect together.

 

In the third quarter, we launch Cash App pay in the US a new contactless payment method for online and in person transactions with Cash App pay individuals can seamlessly pay with their Cash App account as Square sellers using the QR code, they're tapping a button on their mobile device of checkout.

As contactless options into ours have become more mainstream Cash App pay has become a top requested feature by both Cash App customers and Square sellers.

 

This integration further expands Cash App's commerce capabilities, and helps us meet customers where they are providing more flexibility in their payment options.

Cash App pay also enables us to offer sellers a new and innovative way to bring commerce to life for their customer.

 

Lastly, we continue to serve our purpose of economic empowerment and all that we do, but we want to build on that strength to explore opportunities beyond our existing ecosystems to serve new markets.

We have a few emerging initiatives who are investing behind into 2022.

 

For example, with the acquisition of TIDAL, we're building tools for artists, starting with new additions.

We also recently created a business called TBD in order to build an open developer platform with the sole goal of making it easy to create non-custodial permissionless and decentralized financial services with a focus on Bitcoin.

 

We plan to share detailed plans with a white paper later this month.

We announced two more Bitcoin initiatives as well, a consumer Bitcoin hardware wallet, and a Bitcoin mining system, both are focused on helping Bitcoin reach a mainstream audience while at the same time, strengthening the network and ecosystem.

 

We'll build both in the open in collaboration with the community, sharing all of our decisions, progress and questions along the way.

We see each of these long term opportunities that we'll be learning from over multiple years.

 

And with that, I'll turn it over to Amrita.



Amrita Ahuja

Thanks Jack.

 

There are three topics I'd like to cover today.

First, a look at our performance in the third quarter of 2021; second, an update on our seller and Cash App ecosystems in October and third, a look at where we intend to invest in the fourth quarter of 2021 and in 2022, given the compelling growth opportunities ahead.

 

In the third quarter, gross profit was $1.13 billion, an increase of 43% year-over-year or 51% on a two year CAGR basis.

Adjusted EBITDA was $233 million.

 

Both Seller and Cash App showed strong fundamentals during the quarter.

Seller generated gross profit of $606 million of 48% year over year or 29% on a two year CAGR basis.

 

A few growth drivers to call out here.

First we've made strides growing up market as our ecosystem has resonated with larger sellers.

 

In the third quarter, mid-market sellers are those with more than $0.5 million in annualized GPV, grew gross profit, nearly twice as fast as our overall seller business on a two year CAGR basis and have surpassed micro sellers make up our largest segment of GPV.

Our momentum with mid-market sellers in recent quarters has been driven by acquisition of larger sellers, as well as our ability to help small sellers grow on our platform.

 

Second, software and integrated payments remain the fastest growing product in the seller ecosystem on a gross profit basis as sellers value the breadth of our ecosystem, Square invoices in particular experienced strong growth processing, $12 billion in GPV the last 12 months up nearly 2X from two years ago.

Cash App generated gross profit of $512 million up 33% year over year or 104% on a two year CAGR basis with strong engagement in inflows, inflows or money pulled into our ecosystem, achieved strong growth on a two-year CAGR basis even as most government disbursement programs ended.

 

Product adoption has been a key driver of overall inflows, and we continue to see an increase in attach rate for products using cash cards.

In the third quarter, cash card active brought in approximately 70% more inflows each month than non-cash card actives.

 

We also saw an increase in paycheck deposits as we've made direct deposit and bank transfers easier and more visible to customers.

Next, we wanted to share an update on our business through October and what we're seeing real time.

 

As a reminder, we believe two year CAGRs will better reflect underlying trends in our business.

For Seller, we expect gross profit in October to grow by 45% year over year or approximately 30% on a two year CAGR basis relatively in line with growth in third quarter.

 

Fellow GPV was up 24% on a two year CAGR basis.

We've been encouraged by relatively stable growth rates in the past few quarters though, we recognize there are still impacts from COVID in certain parts of the US and our international markets, which could impact GPV trends.

 

For Cash App in October, we expect gross profit growth of greater than 35% year over year or greater than 90% on a two year CAGR basis.

As we had expected, we saw normalization in the two-year gross profit CAGR from July to October as government disbursements ended.

 

On a year over year basis, gross profit growth has been relatively stable around the 35% range from August through October.

We've seen strong engagement here across our broader ecosystem of products and are enthusiastic about our recent launches and product roadmap, which brings me to our intended investments for the fourth quarter of 2021 and the preliminary view of our focus areas for 2022.

 

In the fourth quarter, we expect to increase non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding risk loss by approximately $115 million compared to the third quarter.

Looking to 2022, we see significant investment opportunities across our business and remain focused on driving long term profitable growth.

 

Next year, we expect to grow non-GAAP operating expenses by approximately 40% year over year compared to 2021.

We're approximately $1.3 billion of incremental spend across product development to build out our team, sales and marketing to drive acquisition and G&A to expand support in each of our ecosystems.

 

This figure excludes impacts from after pay, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2022.

Let's take a look at where we're focused, where we're focusing our investment.

 

For Seller, we'll be investing behind our strategic priorities of enabling omnichannel, growing globally and growing up market with larger Seller.

Given the strong growth and lifetime value and gross profit per customer that we've seen over time in our seller business more comfortable, lengthening our payback periods up to the six quarter range as we scale sales and marketing and increase our mix of go to market investments across international, brand awareness and our sales teams.

 

For Cash App, our strategic priorities remain strengthening our network, driving engagement and attracting more inflows into our ecosystem.

Heading into 2022, we're focused on advancing these priorities by investing behind new and emerging product areas.

 

First enabling more commerce for our customers, including our recent launch of Cash App pay and potential future opportunities with after pay, following the closing of the transaction.

Second, providing more financial services by expanding our product set and unlocking new info channels in the Cash App and third, improving the health of our platform and promoting positive behavior by growing support and expanding access.

 

Finally, as Jack mentioned, we now also have emerging areas of growth that we're investing behind and we'll be tracking the progress against milestones over multiple years.

These include Title, TBD, the hardware wallet and Bitcoin mining, which we expect will an aggregate represent roughly 5% of our incremental step up next year, for approximately $140 million in overall non-GAAP OpEx.

 

As we look ahead, we're excited for what the future holds for our company.

We are going after a large and growing addressable market, and we see strong signals on how our products resonate for our customers with compelling unit economics.

 

As a result, we are deliberately investing to reach new audiences, increase the utility for existing customers and expand our products set as we have done over time.

I'll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call.

 
Operator

[Operator instructions] We have the first question come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.

 

Your line is now open.

You may ask your question,

 



Tien-Tsin Huang

Thanks so much.

 

And thanks for the update.

I wanted to ask about Cash App pay if that's okay.

 

And I know Jack, you've been talking about connecting the two ecosystem.

So how important is this in that effort?

 

And what's the strategy to grow this payment method overall, I've been thinking that you'll need to drive more inflows like direct deposit to really get it going.

So maybe if you don't mind updating us on the inflow strategy, that'd be great.

 

Thanks.



Jack Dorsey

Yeah.

 

So I would foresee this as a focus on the importance of Cash App moving more and more into commerce relationship.

So, we have these incredible firewall loop and network effects and peer to peer, and now we get to look forward towards being more of a commerce front end.

 

Fortunately, we have another ecosystem at scale that focuses on Sellers and omnichannel commerce.

So it's easy for us to test a lot of these theories out and actually scale them up over time.

 

Obviously, we do believe that having these multiple ecosystems is our ultimate superpower and differentiator.

So, have both ends of the counter two different audiences and sellers and individuals is really important.

 

There's a thesis behind after pay as well.

And that probably represents some largest potential for connecting the ecosystems, but any connection we make between these ecosystems strengthens the overall value of a broader ecosystem and we think our value to customers and the company generally as well.

 

In terms of direct deposit, direct deposit is one form of info.

We've done a lot to make sure that we are making it more accessible.

 

We're putting it more upfront in the interface.

You'll, notice a bunch of navigational changes that we made.

 

So more of a focus on direct deposit, but generally, there's a number of ways people get money into cash out, not just the pay check, but tax refund, stimulus checks and we want to make sure that it's intuitive and easy for all those and be ready for when people on scale.

I think, the other announcement to look towards in this light is what we just did for families.

 

So allowing any parent or guardian to turn on Cash App for their kids who can also use peer to peer direct deposit and the cash card unlocks an entirely new population for us and will still benefit it from those base level network effects that have grown and Cash App in the first place.

So we have a -- we're going after this problem in multiple ways in our phase new products and features like Cash App for families.

 

And then taking every opportunity we have to connect our ecosystem.

But the, the thing that I think is most interesting here in cash pay is that it really allows us to open the door around Cash App being a commerce front end.

 
Operator

And next question, we have the line of Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research.

 

Your line is now open.

You may ask a question.

 



Darrin Peller

Hey, thanks guys.

 

Nice trends.

I just want to start off and kind of follow up on tangents question around Cash App a bit, just given the impact of stimulus.

 

It's likely running off a bit now and it's, I think it's still impressive to see two year CAERS at a hundred, 4%, but just really love to hear what your view is on the drivers of incremental engagement per user, like sort of touching on the new capabilities and strategies from here on, out for Cash App really pre after pay along with the potential levels, we'd be able to reach just thinking about what the potential engagement, transaction levels, revenue per user, where that can go over the next couple years.



Amrita Ahuja

Thanks guys.

 

Hey, Darren, happy to take that one.

I think it's instructive to look at where Cash App is focusing from a priority perspective, both an aggregate across the ecosystem, as well as from a product development perspective, to inform where we could see potential future growth.

 

So as ever in, as we head into the fourth quarter and into 2022, our strategic priorities remain strengthening our overall network, driving engagement and attracting more in flows and to advance these priorities, we'll continue investing behind product development, sales, and marketing for customer acquisition and support and operations, which underpins the entire platform from a product development perspective.

We're prioritizing a few longer term focus areas, which I think really get to your question around how we drive long term growth RPO and my 10 value for our customers by ultimately driving greater utility for our customers.

 

So first from a commerce perspective, as you've heard from Jack at the beginning of building out a commerce platform for Cash App, you see that with Cash App pay, you see that with teams, you see that with what we're going to be doing in the future with after pay and other new experiences to of greater utility and engagement from a financial services perspective, we're expanding our banking capabilities, including new info channels into Cash App and exploring new products like borrow to help drive engagement and attract more inflows into the network from a health perspective, we're scaling support or expanding acts us.

And we're doing this responsibly to encourage good behavior on our platform, which again, further strengthens the network effects and, and the ability for people to bring funds in and use them across multiple products.

 

And we're building out fulls stack teams dedicated to each of these areas in 2022.

And you'll see that in our hiring plans in product to drive continued product roadmap, velocity, from a marketing perspective, we're investing to drive acquisition for new customers, with a focus on reaching higher lifetime value customers and newer demographics.

 

And as we've seen gross profit and lifetime value per customer grow historically, we've be to increase our customer acquisition costs above the historical $5 range which we believed is too efficient.

Given the opportunities that we see ahead.

 

So some of the levers that go into that to drive investment in 2022 and future growth, paid marketing, this is where we can ramp our paid channels.

And as a grow portion of our spend referrals, which makes enhancement to, we're going to make an enhancement to the overall referral program and use it as a way to cross-sell our ecosystem as well and awareness, which grows the ability to, for people to come in and, and adopt products beyond peer to peer and, and includes reaching CU new types of customers beyond our existing demographics.

 

And it advances Cash App life, lifestyle brand as a true differentiator and finally support.

And the, and the foundation on which our platform is built.

 

The growth of Cash App has outpaced our investment, frankly with customers are adopting, adopting more and more products.

And in 2022, we're going to grow our health team.

 

We'll continue to build out our support and our infrastructure to align with Cash App to sound and growth.

Part of that is deposits and limits initiatives to reduce friction around inflow sources and add new inflow channels.

 

And part of it is, some of the more recent things you've seen, like we recently launched in-app support messaging to all customers and that's quickly become the majority of inquiries.

We'll be dynamic with the spend we'll track returns, but we're excited about these initiatives strategic initiatives and investment areas to drive future growth for us, ultimately driving utility and engagement with the Cash App ecosystem.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Next question we have a question from [indiscernible].

Your line is now open.

 

You may ask a question.



Unidentified Analyst

Hello, my name is Andrea.

 

I'm a business owner here in San Antonio, Texas.

I owned a crafted donut shop and we use mainly all Square features available at the moment.

 

My question was like growing from a food truck to a brick and mortar location, as we continue to expand.

One of the most important things is to ensure that we have all the integrated products we need to roll up market and do you -- can we expect to see Square introduce features as we look to expand?

 



Jack Dorsey

Yeah.

 

A 100% and thank you for using square.

So, we built ecosystem with exactly this in mind.

 

We, we started close to 13 years ago with a very simple solution of accepting credit cards.

And that was meant for, so proprietors and the smallest of businesses, but we wanted to make sure that we were able to scale ahead of our seller's ambitions.

 

So if they decided to get a physical location, they decided to have multiple locations hire more employees, all those things we, we didn't want to get in the way of that.

So all of our tools are meant to scale from the very small, to the very large and progressively disclose more or sophistication as the complexity of your business increases.

 

One, one of recent areas that we wanted to help solve is around employee management.

And we acquired this company called crew that allows us to that, that allows our sellers to have a mess platform so that they can help manage all of their employees and, and all their needs so they can continue to focus on what's most important, which is their, their customers.

 

So it's really important to us that we're not getting in the way of any of our seller growth.

And I think we, we show that by being of, of live very small, but also of the largest, like stadiums who have thousands of vendors of all sizes working.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

We have, the next question comes on the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.

Your line is now open.

 

You may ask a question



Lisa Ellis

Good afternoon.

 

Thanks.

I'm going to switch over to the seller ecosystem.

 

You called out Sellers international expansion in the prepared remarks, particularly the recent expansion into France.

Can you just remind us how much of Sellers' GP is derived from ex US markets and how fast that piece is growing and looking forward, maybe for Amrita where your priority investment areas are looking internationally as you look into '22, thank you?

 



Jack Dorsey

Maybe I'll start this off and Amrita make a follow.

 

So as we look at a new market for, for sellers we want to make sure that we're number one looking at the, the market and understanding like the level of small businesses and entrepreneurship with one and then we want to invest in brand and product awareness.

And then after that, it's not just launching one product, but getting to parody across all of our products across all of our global geos.

 

And then finally, like look at expanding into new markets where we think there's a high potential for success.

Because, we do require a, a partnership with a, a local bank and there's differences in local regulatory.

 

This has to be a very deliberate decision.

So we've made very conscious choices around what markets square in and why.

 

And there's still a lot of opportunity for us to open more of our products in more of the markets that we're already in, such as square loans in more of the places that we already exist.

So that is our focus.

 

So it's a balance between getting into parity in the markets that we're in with all of our products, but also looking at, at entirely new markets as well, France being the, the most.



Amrita Ahuja

And Lisa I'll add that, our markets outside the us have seen strong growth in the third quarter, despite periodic lockdowns.

 

We saw those markets growing faster than the us, so they are growing cause within our national markets are growing as a mix of our seller business.

And they continue to, to your point about next year and our future strategic priorities, they continue to be a key focus area for us in investment opportunity for the future.

 

As I said, sellers, strategic priorities.

As we look ahead are enabling omnichannel going global and growing up market on the going global piece to your question, it's a key part of our sales and marketing initiatives for next year and a key piece of why we're comfortable expanding our paybacks up to the six quarter range.

 

As we see a greater mix of spend in sales and marketing towards brand spend and international areas, what those key sales and marketing investments are brand and awareness to drive, reach, and top of funnel demand, particularly with larger sellers and across the breadth of the ecosystem for which continues to be our largest percentage of mix.

And then global, scaling sales and marketing in these markets outside the us, where which is growing faster than the us and where we've seen paybacks improve over time, where we'll be ramping our spend in these markets outside the us in 2022, given the new geographies that we're in, include France Ireland and with the beta in Spain, as well as potential new launches for the future.

 

We expect these areas to have lower ROI in early years and improve our over time.

And we see them as a critical strategic area for us for the future that we want to invest into given the strong product market fit and how our products are resonating in these markets.

 

It's also a key piece of the investments we make, of course, in product development to localize and expand these services and features for each of these markets closing the product app that Jack was talking about these international markets and from a support perspective, to make sure that these sellers can reach us with any of their needs across international, as well as the us.

So key focus area for us, and very strategic for the future.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse.

Your line is now open.

 

You may ask a question.



Timothy Chiodo

Great, thank you for digging the question.

 

I want to dig into the large seller approach in 2022 and beyond.

And I'm really bringing this up in light is the potential for a more bundled approach to work with those large sellers.

 

And that's including some of the big online enterprise customers that have relationships with after pay.

So I was hoping we could talk just a little bit about that full suite or bundle of offerings that could be sold into those large seller, whether, whether it's by now pay later the Cash App pay button or your more traditional payments processing or unbranded, if you will.

 

And then of course, other services that square offers and really the thought being there is it might allow square to have a more competitive or sort of a unique angle when talking with those large enterprises.



Jack Dorsey

Yeah, this is exactly it.

 

As I said earlier, this is one of our, one of our biggest strengths is that we, we do have ecosystems that are cohesive.

They're very broad in their tool sets.

 

So it allows us to reach sellers in a much more cohesive way, especially given the maturity of our developer platforms or the I, or your seller.

And I have legacy tools or tools I that are very custom and specific to me.

 

I can still integrate with square in a way that that's needed are definitely point to the number of stadiums that we've turned on as proof of that.

And that also shows like the potential for, for bundling, as you say we believe that after closing the transaction, after they can add really drive commerce across both sellers and individuals we think it's a really smart connection between the two ecosystems, obviously after pay is has done very well with larger retailers.

 

And that's both on the seller side and also on the individual side where I think there's natural homes within the, our seller business and also cash up.

So back to the comment on cash app.

 

Hey, like the more word cash app is seen as a commerce front end from discovery to transactions the stronger our relationship the brain, and that's not just on the cash app side, but also on the square seller side.

And as we worked to integrate app with the transaction closes, we have even more opportunity.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Next question we had the line of Trevor Williams of Jefferies.

Your line is now open.

 

You may ask your question.



Trevor Williams

Great, thanks.

 

Good afternoon.

And I'll throw another one in on the cash app.

 

So as we look at the size of your user base at $40 million monthly actives that puts you at a scale that very few thanks or close to I mean, how do you think of the benefits of scale or what competitive advantage a larger user base gives you beyond just having more users to monetize when you have network effects on the peer-to-peer side.

But just trying to get at how a larger user base can unlock a higher level of monetization.

 

I mean, the benefit from when you plug in after Afterpay, that seems pretty clear, but just thinking more on cash app as a standalone today, really what the scale advantages are.

Thanks so much.

 



Jack Dorsey

Yeah, I think number one, like it, it gives us a lot more opportunity to strengthen our existing products, but also create new products on top of cash up as the foundation.

 

And, and those can be products for both individuals and customers, but also for sellers as well as more and more commerce moves online and purely digital and is not found offline.

We, do have businesses using cash app because it's the way for them to transact and it's familiar for their customers and even that builds upon the network effect.

 

But I, guess I would directionally point you back to discovery with a larger base of customers, we get more opportunities to introduce discovery features to our network.

And, we have the starts of those things and boost for instance where a we can, we can highlight a particular activity or a particular seller whether it be in your neighborhood or nationwide.

 

And I think there's a lot more to come there and we have the benefit of again, having a seller network and ecosystem that we can further turn on to all of our passionate customers.

And as we have no more as we have a compelling product experience around discovery local and businesses around me become really important and they, and they open access even the, to it to an even greater degree.

 

So I think there's, there's a lot of potential and having the scale we have, but I, I, I feel we can go much, much higher and that's the intention then, especially as we think about cash up outsides the US and UK, which for insights me as well as being more global.



Amrita Ahuja

And I have Trevor that I think a key focus area for us is the engagement of this customer base.

 

as we said, back in June, nearly two thirds of those $40 million monthly actives that you referenced transacted each week on average across our cash app ecosystem.

So the more we can do there to make this a daily utility to make our ability to provide customers value on a regular basis.

 

And throughout the day, the more opportunity we have to drive further network effects, drive further engagement and ultimately drive higher lifetime values, which then enables us to invest back into the ecosystem and provide differentiated value to these customers.

So I think both the reach of the network and the driving continued engagement are key priorities for us.

Next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat at Bernstein.

Your line is now open.

 

You may ask a question.



Harshita Rawat

Good afternoon.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

Jack, I wonder follow-up in your prepared remarks regarding Bitcoin.

 

Are you looking to expand into crypto beyond Bitcoin, buy and sell, for example, buy and sell other cryptocurrencies and also enabling your users to kind of engage in defined NSP assistance.

Thank you.

 



Jack Dorsey

We're not.

 

Our focus is on helping Bitcoins become the native currency for the internet.

And we want to, we have a number of initiatives towards that goal cash app is just one.

 

We're going to be building a hardware wallet, they're exploring Bitcoin mining, a consumer device to, to mind the claim at home or in a business our solid businesses.

In fact we, we believe, this focus is important.

 

We believe it's right.

And a lot of it has to do with the, the resilience, the fundamentals, the principles that Bitcoin offers.

 

And we also want to make sure that we're giving back to the community as much as possible in this is also reflected in our approaches for Bitcoin wallet, Bitcoin mining.

And our new business unit called TBD, which is focused on building a developer platform to enable more ideas around decentralized finance on the Bitcoin stack and all that stability that offers and, all the resilience that's had over the decade plus.

 

So we're going to release more details on what TBD is steering with a white paper on November 19 and we're really excited about the direction and excited about our focus.

Next question comes from the line of Josh Beck of KBCM.

Your line is now open.

 

You may ask a question.



Josh Beck

Thank you team for taking the question.

 

I wanted to shift gears back to cash app.

Obviously the demographic on the age is expanding and certainly getting into that 13 plus category.

 

So I'm curious what you view as the defining elements of cash app for that segment.

Obviously there are a couple of five and companies also focus on teens and tweens, if you will.

 

So just curious on how you frame that and where you see that opportunity in the next few years.



Jack Dorsey

Yeah.

 

This is a really big launch for us because we're, it's been a huge request by Cash customers.

But we're there we're finally able to fulfill obviously the sister must have a larger population now we don't have access to before 29 teens in the United States.

 

But then it's going to our fundamentals that are showing the peer to peer fundamentals.

Just receiving family, received money from your friend who send money to your friends or from your, your parents being able to get a cash card design a cash app card, even the cash card that goes in the dark and being able to use it and take my parents can send me my allowance or I can own the workforce and actually use the direct deposit function on it.

 

So most everything that you would expect from cash app will exist with this feature side, but you will have controls for the parents or guardian.

So we think it's a great way to get into the space.

 

It's a start.

We, we definitely have to expand it.

 

But all the strength that we have in building the network effects of art or business and all the products that we, that we offer we benefit now from a much larger audience and we'll continue to take on the responsibility and health we have with things like the claim and the savings account and cash card and stocks as we, as we have with the main cash app.

So we always want to provide as much information as possible, so people can be responsible and healthy with their finances.

 

And in we'll definitely include, probably think about cash up for families in pertains



Amrita Ahuja

Josh.

 

I would, I would just add that.

I think some of the key differentiating factors for cash app here is the scale of the network effects, which the utility ultimately for these teams and for their families and the aspirational brand that cash app has cultivated through the years, which is truly authentic, certainly with gen Z and certainly with this audience.

 

And then third, as Jack said, the strength of the broader network, the fact that it's not just cash card, it's not just peer to peer, but there's so many other things that you'll be able to do over time which enables that sort of financial inclusion for this audience.

And those are the things that truly differentiate cash app for, for this product and for this audience.

Thank you.

 

We have the next question comes into the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays.

Your line is now open.

 

You may ask a question.



Ramsey El-Assal

Hi, thanks so much for taking my question this evening.

 

I wanted to ask about an ACH acceptance tool that I think you guys announced earlier in the year in partnership with Platt, and it's sort of at a high level.

What are your thoughts more broadly on pay by bank and other types of payments that don't rely on the traditional card rails?

 

And maybe if I can tack one on, are you planning to offer a pay with Bitcoins feature through cash app pay at some point next?



Jack Dorsey

Yeah, so I think what you're referencing is maybe the sellers accepting bank transfer payments which definitely have a lower processing piece.

 

So we're, we're always looking for opportunities to add efficiency to the sack, both for sellers and for cash up.

As soon as we have, as we have the foundational infrastructure and interface in place we find ways to make it even more efficient, cheaper for our customers in terms of cash app pay in Bitcoin and specifically lightning functionality probably not rum.

 

It's definitely something that the foundation will allow.

And we're, as I said before, like our focus is on helping Bitcoin to be the native currency in that.

 

So currency aspects of it in the network are really important to us.

And we're going to do more in that space.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

We have, the next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.

Brian, you may ask your question.

 



Bryan Keane

Hi guys.

 

And thanks for taking the question.

Just want to ask it about on the, how much stimulus is still impacting the numbers.

 

Just curious on the saving rate for cash app users and their balances right now.

And I know you guys are doing several things to get balances up on cash app.

 

So just be interested in figuring out a little bit about that.



Jack Dorsey

Hey, happy to take this one.

 

Maybe we'll hit balance as quickly.

First we saw customer balances slightly down quarter, over quarter of 143% on a year over year basis.

 

We would really warrant you though to look at info inflows more broadly.

As balances are just a measure of growth at a snapshot in time at the end of the quarter.

 

And so what we really orient to as we think about the health of the network is of course, as we said, overall, network size engagement, but also inflows.

What we've seen is that as we had expected as the government disbursements came to the end, largely during the third quarter, we found normalization in the two year K the rate on gross profit from July to October on a year over year basis, always seen relative stability from August to October in around that 35% range on a year-over-year basis.

 

In October, we expect growth on gross profit of greater than 35% year over year and greater than 90% on a two year CAGR basis.

And then as we look ahead, of course, when we think about our customer spending power, which is ultimately what impacts inflows what we're focused on for the long-term is all those key priorities that we laid out for the year ahead around commerce platform that we're building around financial services around the health of the network, which enables us to ultimately bring more, deposits, more inflows into the ecosystem and enables our customers to then use them in more ways across the ecosystem.

 

And I think ultimately that's in the medium to long-term.

What drives inflows for cash app.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

We have the next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI.

Your line is now open.

 

You may ask a question.



David Togut

Thanks so much.

 

I'd like to better understand your closed loop strategy with Afterpay.

We've been following your BNP L pilot and cash app, which appears to be defaulting payments to store balances.

 

Given your stored balances were around 2 billion at the end of 2020, and constantly being refilled.

It seems it be NPL with Afterpay at square sellers could generate significant transaction margin benefits.

 

Can you help us better understand your closed loop strategy with Afterpay?



Jack Dorsey

Sure.

 

I can jump in on this one.

I think what we're focused on ultimately is the product experience for our customers and the commerce platform that we're building, which, this payment type enables us to drive things like in-app discovery within cash.

 

And as we've seen with Afterpay that with their own app, they've been driving historically a million leads a day to some of their enterprise merchants.

So when you think about beyond just the payment type that B NPL enables, or even things like cash app pay enables, really the strategic imperative here for us is the commerce enablement.

 

At the, that the integration of Afterpay enabled for us with, with both cash app and with our seller ecosystem, of course, there will be opportunities to think about cost savings over time, but the street needed focus is on commerce and in app discovery for us.
Operator

Thank you.

 

We have the next question come from the line of George Mihalos of Cowen.

Your line is now open.

 

You may ask a question.



George Mihalos

Great.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

Just wanted to ask as it relates to cash app and the importance of the cash card, can you remind us how penetrated cash card is within the cash app ecosystem and then maybe emerita, you can kind of update us on the breakdown of different revenue sources within cash app the instant PDP cash card and the like, thank you.

 



Amrita Ahuja

Sure.

 

So to hit cash card first, we continue to see strong adoption here for cash card with our customers.

It is our highest attached product upside a peer-to-peer and what we had shared back in March is that 7 million customers within cash up or using cash card on a weekly basis, we're seeing it drive regular utility for our customers.

 

That rate of weekly usage had nearly doubled year over year, going faster than the monthly active cash card customers.

They're using cash.

 

Our customers are using the card for everyday purchases for food, for transportation at major retailers, really signaling that customers want to use cash card to manage their everyday expenses.

Obviously, boost is a piece of that with a unique rewards and offerings that we have here to drive that utility and awareness around card.

 

And we've also been working on expanding functionality for cash card globally as a third quarter.

Customers can now use cash card in-person and online in many countries outside the us.

 

And when we think about the importance of driving attached to products like cash card, what we see is that these customers are highly engaged across our ecosystem on other products.

Historically, we've seen cash card access dots, nearly twice the number of products as non-cash card customers, which has led to greater money brought into cash app.

 

Overall, obviously we shared that stat that in this quarter cash card active brought 70% more inflows into the ecosystem on average than non-cash card active.

And it was a key driver of overall info growth for us.

 

So we see a real opportunity here to grow engagement and monetization, both with cash card and beyond cash card buy as customers take on more and more products like investing in direct deposit and on, I think the second part of your question is the breakdown of revenue sources.

We continue to see a diversification in how the utility of the different products we have within cash app.

 

And it's a key focus area for us to drive that product adoption across cash app, as well as to drive ultimately monetization and regular engagement.

And that is something that, especially as we look ahead, when we look at the product roadmap ahead, we expect to see even greater diversification over time.

Sorry for the mess up from Mizuho.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

So really quickly on, can you maybe quantify the potential upside from a credit online tax for next year for the cash app, if any, thank you.

 



Jack Dorsey

Yeah, just to, just to start, the reason we did this as it helps expand our direct deposit charges and brings more implosion, the catch up gives more information to customers to understand how tax filing will work on cash up.

 

This is tax season and we think there's a lot of opportunity to simplify a bunch of tasks that one has to do in the financial system taxes is a big one.

And we want to make sure that we have a successful product launch ahead of the tax refund season.

 

So customers have a really seamless experience and we're highlighting direct, positive and another potentially powerful info for us.

Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q3 FY 2022 Earnings Conference Call.

 

Today's call is being recorded.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Gala, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance.

 

Please go ahead.



Tejas Gala

Thank you.

 

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.

 



Tim Cook

Thank you, Tejas.

 

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us.

Today, Apple is reporting another record June quarter with revenue of $83 billion, which was better than we expected despite supply constraints, strong foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of our business in Russia.

 

We set June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe and in the rest of Asia Pacific region.

We also saw June quarter revenue records in both developed and emerging markets with very strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Indonesia and Vietnam and a near doubling of revenue in India.

 

We saw great enthusiasm for our products and services, resulting in an all-time record for our installed base of active devices.

Our supply constraints were less than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, coming in slightly below the range we discussed during our last call.

 

We know that this is a time of significant challenge around the world for all of us confronting new variants of COVID-19, to those experiencing a prolonged humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and everyone dealing with the consequences of an uncertain economic environment.

We know that much of the world is living through uneasy times, and it is all the more reason why we are working hard to help our customers navigate the world as it is while empowering them to create the world as it can be.

 

Turning to iPhone.

We set a June quarter record for both revenue and switchers to iPhone.

 

With its advanced performance, capability and ease of use, customers continue to find that iPhone remains the gold standard for smartphones.

And they've been raving about the iPhone 13 lineup's extraordinary camera quality with features like cinematic mode and macro photography to create eye-catching content.

 

We were also proud to celebrate the 15th anniversary of iPhone, a device that continues to change the world in profound ways with each new innovation.

Last month, Apple unleashed a wave of innovation, including the completely redesigned MacBook Air and a new 13-inch MacBook Pro.

 

Both of these systems are powered by M2, our next generation of Apple silicon for Mac.

M2 delivers a faster CPU, GPU and neural engine along with higher memory bandwidth and new capabilities like Pro Res acceleration.

 

And it continues the tremendous pace of innovation in Apple silicon for the Mac.

We continue to have supply constraints with Mac, but we're encouraged by the strong response from customers to our incredible lineup.

 

iPad, like Mac, continued to see strong demand during the June quarter despite ongoing supply constraints.

Customers and developers have been especially excited about the new features we're bringing to iPad with iPadOS 16.

 

This update was one of the many announcements we made at a truly extraordinary WWDC, where we shared a range of new features that give customers more control of their experience than ever before.

This includes the ability to edit or delete sent messages, a new way of organizing apps on iPad and Mac, and an all-new customizable lock screen on iPhone and so much more.

 

Today, iOS 16, iPadOS 16, MacOS Ventura and watchOS 9 are all in public beta, and we couldn't be more excited to see what our community of developers creates with them.

We unveiled new innovations and accessibility such as door detection and live captions that support users with disabilities with navigation, health, communication and more.

 

We also announced Apple Pay Later, which gives customers more flexibility to make purchases with their Apple devices.

And with our next generation of CarPlay, we're improving the driving experience with deeper integration into vehicle hardware, allowing drivers to control their music, change the temperature and monitor their fuel levels, all from a single integrated platform.

 

In the Wearables, Home and Accessories category, the innovation infused across our products continues to win over new customers.

Apple Watch remains a great way for health-conscious customers to track their overall wellness and fitness.

 

And we're bringing them even more data about their workouts, sleep cycles and medications with updates soon to arrive on watchOS 9.

We were also pleased to get FDA approval for a new feature that will let users with irregular heart rhythms track the time they spend in Afib.

 

Turning to Services.

Customers continue to engage enthusiastically with our content across news, fitness, music, gaming and more.

 

Services revenue rose to $19.6 billion, a June quarter record and a 12% increase year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations.

We're proud of how Apple TV+ productions like Severance and Black Bird have captured the popular imagination, and we're looking forward to more exceptional content developed by extraordinary creators throughout the year.

 

In 2.5 years since launch, Apple TV+ has now earned 250 wins and over 1,100 award nominations and counting.

Just this month, we learned that Apple TV+ earned 52 Emmy Award nominations across 13 titles.

 

In our last call, I mentioned Friday Night Baseball on Apple TV+, which is already delighting baseball fans.

And last month, we announced a 10-year deal to present Major League soccer matches around the world, giving global soccer fans a whole new way of viewing their favorite sport.

 

One of the best parts of WWDC was welcoming developers to Apple Park while continuing to connect with developers all over the world.

This year, we had an incredible group of developers and more opportunities to learn from one another than ever before.

 

It was a truly special experience and a reminder of the economic miracle the App Store represents.

We are proud of the fact that the iOS app economy supports more than 2.2 million jobs here in the United States and many more around the world.

 

It's been wonderful to see earnings by small developers more than double over the past 2 years.

And as we're supporting developers, we're also doing our part to protect customers.

 

In 2021, we prevented nearly $1.5 billion in fraudulent transactions by stopping over 1.6 million risky and vulnerable apps and app updates.

Now I want to turn to retail.

 

This quarter, we opened the doors to Apple's first store in the Hubei province in China, welcoming the community to a beautiful new space.

And earlier today, we opened Apple Brompton Road, our fifth store in Central London.

 

We also expanded today at Apple Creative Studios to reach even more young creatives from underrepresented communities to help them realize their potential and bring their best ideas to life.

I'd like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to our team members working in Apple Stores, customer care centers and channel partner stores and to our Apple Care teams for their incredible work supporting customers wherever they are.

 

Creating innovative products and services that enrich people's lives is our mission.

Leading with our values and everything we do gives that mission purpose.

 

That includes a commitment to the environment where we continue our aggressive pursuit of our 2030 goals.

It includes our focus on diversity and inclusion, where we are committed as ever to making progress.

 

And it includes our work to promote racial equity and justice.

We recently announced that the Global Equity Innovation Hub, in partnership with Cal State Northridge, will provide new community grants to Hispanic-serving institutions to help the next generation of creators and innovators build skills and pursue high-demand careers in STEM.

 

We also celebrated the graduation of the inaugural class of our Developer Academy in Detroit from a program designed to give students the skills they need to pursue jobs in the thriving iOS app economy.

Leading with our values also means leading with a steadfast commitment to privacy and security.

 

Last month, we announced the introduction of passkey, a next-generation credential that's intended to replace passwords.

A passkey can't be phished nor can it be stolen by hackers in a data breach because the information is stored on your device and your device alone.

 

And as part of our effort to combat targeted attacks against the highest risk targets like journalists and human rights activists, we introduced Lockdown Mode, which is designed to protect those most at risk of sophisticated digital attacks.

And we're committed to doing our part to address the housing crisis across California.

 

To date, we have deployed more than $1.3 billion to a number of initiatives, including ones that provide financial assistance to low and moderate income first-time home buyers develop new affordable housing and help support vulnerable populations.

This quarter has ultimately been a reflection of our resilience and our optimism.

 

As we look forward, we're clear-eyed about the uncertainty in the macro environment.

Yet we remain ever focused on the same vision that has guided us from the beginning.

 

We strive every day to be a place where imagination ignites innovation like nowhere else, where good people come together to achieve great things, where customers are the center of everything we do.

And we'll continue to execute on that vision as we always have, led by a focus on excellence and a desire to leave the world better than we found it.

 

And with that, I'll turn it over to Luca.



Luca Maestri

Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone.

 

We are very pleased to report June quarter financial results that continue to demonstrate our ability to innovate across hardware, software and services while operating our business effectively during very challenging economic circumstances.

We set a June quarter revenue record of $83 billion, up 2% year-over-year despite supply constraints, over 300 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of our business in Russia.

 

Around the world, we set new June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific.

On the product side, revenue was $63.4 billion with a June quarter revenue record for iPhone.

 

During the quarter, our installed base of active devices continue to grow well, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments.

Our Services set a June quarter revenue record of $19.6 billion, up 12% over a year ago, with all-time revenue records in the Americas and the rest of Asia Pacific and June quarter records in Europe and Greater China.

 

We also achieved June quarter revenue records in each major Services category, including all-time revenue records for Music, Cloud Services, Apple Care and Payment Services.

Company gross margin was 43.3%, down 40 basis points from last quarter as seasonal loss of leverage and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by favorable mix.

 

Products gross margin was 34.5%, down 190 basis points sequentially, mainly driven by seasonal loss of leverage, mix and FX.

Services gross margin was 71.5%, down 110 basis points sequentially due to a different mix and foreign exchange.

 

Net income was $19.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.20, while operating cash flow of $22.9 billion was a June quarter record.

Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories.

 

iPhone revenue grew 3% year-over-year to a June quarter record of $40.7 billion despite foreign exchange headwinds as customer response to our iPhone 13 family continue to be strong.

We set June quarter records in both developed and emerging markets.

 

And the iPhone active installed base reached a new all-time high across all geographies as a result of this level of sales performance combined with unmatched customer loyalty.

In fact, the latest survey of U.S.

 

consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%.

We also attracted a record number of switchers for the June quarter, with strong double-digit year-over-year growth.

 

For Mac, we generated revenue of $7.4 billion despite supply constraints and negative effects.

We continue to be excited about our long-term opportunity with Mac and redefining the PC experience with our relentless innovation.

 

Our investment focus on Mac has helped drive significant growth in our installed base, which reached an all-time high during the June quarter as nearly half of the customers purchasing a Mac were new to the product.

iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year due to supply constraints and negative foreign exchange.

 

Customer response to our iPad lineup continue to be strong across consumer, education and enterprise markets around the world.

And the iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of the customers during the quarter being new to the product.

 

Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 8% year-over-year as we faced foreign exchange headwinds, different launch timing for Home and Accessories products and supply constraints as well as the overall macroeconomic environment.

Despite this, our installed base of devices in the category hit a new all-time record, thanks to very strong customer loyalty and high new tool rates.

 

For example, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.

Services had a June quarter revenue record of $19.6 billion, up 12% despite almost 500 basis points of FX headwinds as well as impacts from our business in Russia and the macroeconomic environment.

 

We set June quarter revenue records in both developed and emerging markets and set all-time records in many countries around the world, including the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Korea and India.

The record level of performance of our Services portfolio during the June quarter reflects the strength of our ecosystem on many fronts: First, our installed base has continued to grow, reaching an all-time high across each geographic segment and major product category.

 

We also saw increased customer engagement with our Services during the quarter.

Our transacting accounts, paid accounts and accounts with paid subscriptions all grew double digits year-over-year.

 

And paid subscriptions showed very strong growth.

We now have more than 860 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 160 million during the last 12 months alone.

 

And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current Services offerings, from a constant flow of new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to great new features we recently announced for iCloud and Apple Music, which we believe our customers will love.

In the enterprise market, our customers are increasingly investing in Apple products as a strategy to attract and retain talent.

 

Bank of America is providing iPhones to all of its financial advisers so they can instantly access client information and provide timely wealth management advice from anywhere.

Wipro, another large global enterprise customer, is investing in MacBook Air with M1 as a competitive advantage when recruiting new graduates globally, thanks to its superior performance and lower total cost of ownership.

 

And with the new M2 chip powering MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro, we expect more customers to make Mac available to their entire workforce.

Let me now turn to our cash position.

 

We ended the quarter with $179 billion in cash and marketable securities.

We repaid $3 billion in maturing debt while increasing commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $120 billion.

 

As a result, net cash was nearly $60 billion at the end of the quarter.

We returned over $28 billion to shareholders during the June quarter.

 

This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $21.7 billion through open market repurchases of 143 million Apple shares.

We continue to believe there is great value in our stock and maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.

 

As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call.

Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.

 

Overall, we believe our year-over-year revenue growth will accelerate during the September quarter compared to the June quarter despite approximately 600 basis points of negative year-over-year impact from foreign exchange.

On the product side, we expect supply constraints to be lower than what we experienced during the June quarter.

 

Specifically related to Services, we expect revenue to grow but decelerate from the June quarter due to macroeconomic factors and foreign exchange.

We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%.

 

We expect OpEx to be between $12.9 billion and $13.1 billion.

We expect OI&E to be around negative [indiscernible] impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.

 

Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock, payable on August 11, 2022, to shareholders of record as of August 8, 2022.

With that, let's open the call to questions.

 



Tejas Gala

Thank you, Luca.

 

[Operator Instructions].

Operator, may we have the first question, please?

 
Operator

[Operator Instructions].

 

We'll take our first question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.



Amit Daryanani

I guess two from my side.

 

Maybe to start on the gross margin discussion, Luca.

You said that implying gross margin will be down I think, 130, 140 basis points sequentially and down a bit year-over-year as well in September.

 

Maybe just what are the puts and takes here.

And then very specifically, can you actually just call what the FX headwinds are embedded in the September quarter gross margin, that would be helpful.

 



Luca Maestri

Yes, Amit.

 

We're guiding 41.5% to 42.5%.

On a sequential basis, the decline is expected to be driven by, as you mentioned, foreign exchange but also mix, which will be partially offset by better leverage.

 

We expect foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis to be 50 basis points.

If you look at it from a year-over-year standpoint, we are in the ballpark of a year ago in spite of the fact that foreign exchange is going to be 130 basis points negative to a year ago.

 

So clearly, foreign exchange is something that is affecting us but we think we're navigating that fairly well.



Amit Daryanani

Fair enough.

 

And then if I could just ask Tim the question.

There's a lot of macro worries and high inflation impacting consumer demand.

 

Certainly doesn't seem to be very visible in your performance and your expectations.

So I'm wondering if you talk about, are you seeing any implications from recession fears or inflation fears to your end demand?

 

And really just related to that, wearables decline was notable.

Is that where you would typically see initial signs of consumer softening perhaps?

 



Tim Cook

Thanks for the question.

 

If you -- I'm not an economist and so I'll sort of narrow my comments to what we saw in the business.

And if you look at the June quarter, we do believe that we saw macroeconomic headwinds that impacted our business and our results.

 

And so one of those is clearly the FX, which Luca has mentioned, that was over 300 basis points on year-over-year growth rates.

When you look at the product categories, on iPhone, there was no obvious evidence of macroeconomic impact during the June quarter besides FX, obviously.

 

Mac and iPad were so gated by supply that we didn't have enough product to test the demand.

And Wearables, Home and Accessories, as you mentioned and as Luca mentioned, we did see some impact there that we would attribute to a macroeconomic environment.

 

When you then look at Services, there were some Services that were impacted, for example, like digital advertising was clearly impacted by the macroeconomic environment.

And so it's a mixed bag in terms of what we believe that we saw.

 

Overall, we are very happy with the results.

And when you think about the number of challenges in the quarter, we feel really good about the growth that we put up for the quarter.

 
Operator

We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.

 



Harsh Kumar

Yes.

 

First of all, congratulations.

As these are tough times, you guys are putting up tremendous results so we appreciate that as investors.

 

My question is, when I look at your Services business, I see a $20 billion business on a quarterly basis.

And you keep adding -- as a company, you keep adding very interesting and transformative features such as payments, something like that every year.

 

So I'm struggling to find a good way to think about how to model the growth of this business, considering that you add innovative features.

So now that it's fairly matured as a business, what would be a good way for us to think about as investors to model the Services business?

 

And I do have a follow-up.



Luca Maestri

Well, as you know, we don't provide guidance past the current quarter.

 

But I think the way to think about it, certainly the way we think about it is that there's a number of levers in our Services business to take into account.

The first one is installed base.

 

Installed base is the engine for our company and it continues to grow.

As I mentioned, it has reached an all-time high across every geographic segment, across every product category.

 

And so that's very important.

Then the second lever is the customer engagement.

 

And we know that our customers are getting more and more engaged over time.

Transacting accounts, paid accounts, paid subscriptions are growing, so the level of engagement continues to grow.

 

And then as you mentioned, the breadth and the quality of the services that we offer tends to grow over time.

So these are all things that tend to help us over the long term.

 

If you go back and you look at our growth rates over a number of quarters now, they've always been very good.

Of course, the macro environment can have an impact on this business.

 

Tim has mentioned, for example, digital advertising can be affected at times.

During COVID, some of the compares have been a bit lumpy because there have been lockdowns and reopenings and so on.

 

So it's very difficult to talk about a steady state growth rate for our Services business.

But when we look at the entirety of what we are doing in the Services space, we feel very good about the future of the business.

 



Harsh Kumar

Luca, very helpful.

 

And for my follow-up, valuations have come down in the last 18 months or so for things and companies and targets that you might look at.

I guess, particularly in the Services area, would there be an appetite on behalf of Apple to accelerate the growth of its Services business by looking at external products to acquire?

 



Tim Cook

We always look and we ask ourselves if it's -- how strategic it is, and we never buy just to buy or buy just for revenue purposes.

 

But we would buy something that is strategic for us.

To date, we have concentrated on smaller IP and people acquisitions.

 

But I wouldn't rule anything out for the future, and obviously, we are constantly surveilling the market.
Operator

We'll take our next question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.

 



Erik Woodring

I have two as well.

 

Maybe Tim, if I start with you, I think there's a debate in the market that if you look back over time, there's been a 3-year cadence to iPhone cycles.

We're 2 years into your 5G iPhone evolution.

 

You're on track to grow units in '21 and '22.

That implies there could be some pressure next year as upgrade rates slow.

 

But your comments really suggest no slowdown.

You're seeing double-digit growth in customers new to iPhone.

 

So can you just walk us through some of the various factors you believe are driving this continued iPhone strength?

And then I have a follow-up.

 



Tim Cook

Today, the product and the innovation within the product that is driving it.

 

And of course, the other key variables are some things that Luca mentioned earlier where the size of the installed base has been growing significantly.

We also, just in this quarter, the June quarter, set a June quarter record for switchers with strong double-digit growth.

 

And so this is fueling the additional installed base even more.

And we continue to execute across some significant geographies where there's a very low penetration of iPhone.

 

Some of those were called out in the opening remarks between Indonesia and Vietnam and India, where we did quite well, and iPhone tends to be the engine for those markets, particularly at the beginning of creating the market there for Apple products.

And so we're really looking at all of these things from the installed base to the number of switchers to the geographic distribution.

 

Of course, the most important thing for us is to maintain an incredible customer satisfaction and loyalty from the customers.

And we're really pleased that it's currently at 98% for the latest iPhones.

 

And so those are the things that underpin it.

5G has been an accelerant.

 

And the 5G penetration, particularly if you look at it globally, is still quite low.

In some geographies, it's obviously higher, but around the world, 5G penetration is still low.

 

And so I think there's reason to be optimistic.



Erik Woodring

Okay, that's helpful.

 

And then maybe, Luca, for you.

As we move from the June to the September quarter, maybe can you dig a level deeper and kind of help us understand some of the moving pieces in the Services business?

 

Meaning where do you think we could see an acceleration or maybe a deceleration?

And should we still expect double-digit growth?

 

If you could just frame that for us, that would be great.



Luca Maestri

Yes, Erik.

 

I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we expect some deceleration from the 12% that we've had in the June quarter.

Keep in mind, we're going to see, on a year-over-year basis, 600 basis points, 6% impact from foreign exchange so that is a big element for us.

 

Also keep in mind that we're still lapping the impact of our business in Russia in these numbers.

And Tim mentioned that there are some pockets of weakness, primarily in digital advertising that we will need to work through.

 

But at the same time, our Services business a year ago grew a lot and so also the compare is a bit challenging.

So we don't have a very specific number to give out today.

 

Of course, we expect to grow.

We will see how the quarter develops.

 
Operator

We'll take our next question from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.

 



Richard Kramer

Tim, you cited growth in Apple apps in the past, and clearly, the privacy policies you've taken have really reshaped the mobile ad market.

 

Can you give us a sense of how you see Apple's role as an ad network and perhaps helping developers to monetize not just app sales but also growing ad monetization over time?



Tim Cook

Yes.

 

Richard, we view privacy as a fundamental human right.

And so what we try to do with all of our features on privacy is put the decision back at the user where we believe it belongs as to whether they want to share their data or not.

 

And so that was what was behind application tracking transparency and a number of other features.

We're trying to empower the user to own their data and make their own choices.

 

In terms of us selling ads, we have a search ad business across the App Store that we believe represents a great way for discovery for small and large developers.

And so I see that we play a role in that.

 



Richard Kramer

And then maybe my follow-up for Luca.

 

Can you give us a sense, especially now that you're launching Pay Later, what steps you might be taking to improve affordability of Apple products?

We know that it's going to be a tight time economically for people around the world.

 

And how do you see the evolution of various payment plans out of the -- you see in the U.S.

now into other markets, especially emerging markets?

 



Luca Maestri

Yes.

 

I mean, obviously, affordability is a very important topic for us.

It's been for many years.

 

Buy now, pay later is the latest that we are doing on this front.

Fundamentally, we are working on 2 major initiatives for affordability.

 

One is installment plans and installment plans have become more widespread around the world, not only here in the United States but in most markets, particularly in emerging markets.

Incredibly important in terms of reducing the affordability threshold.

 

And trading programs.

Trading programs are available in a number of markets.

 

We can do better in other markets.

They're incredibly important because the residual value of our products is a huge differentiator for our users.

 

After they use our devices, they can bring them back and they retain much more value than other platforms.

And therefore, it's important for us to raise that awareness.

 

And so we will continue to expand those programs around the world.

So installments and trade-ins, very, very important on affordability.

 
Operator

We'll take our next question from David Vogt with UBS.

 



David Vogt

I just wanted to circle back on sort of the macro and sort of the demand signals that you're seeing versus sort of the supply chains that you're facing.

 

I know that there's been a couple of U.S.

carriers that have talked about some of their customers having some difficulty paying bills.

 

And you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you saw sort of the record number of switchers in the quarter.

So just wanted to kind of get a sense for what you're seeing in that particular channel without naming a specific customer.

 

And are you seeing any sort of issues from a spin-down effect maybe because customers are having some difficulty because of inflation?

And then I have a follow-up on Macs.

 



Tim Cook

On the -- from an aggregate point of view, looking at it worldwide, looking at the data on iPhone for the June quarter, there's not obvious evidence in there that there's a macroeconomic headwind.

 

I'm not saying that there's not one.

I'm saying that the data doesn't show it where we can clearly see that in the Wearables, Home and Accessories area.

 

And so I would differentiate those 2.



David Vogt

Great.

 

And then on the Mac business, I know that you are severely supply chain constrained.

But is there a way to kind of think about the impact of the market overall on the Mac business versus the supply chain?

 

It sounds like -- I guess, it sounds like it's almost effectively 100% supply chain constrained, but we're obviously hearing, like I'm sure you guys are seeing, anecdotal evidence and some quantifiable evidence that the broader PC market is slowing.

And I think about 90 days ago, you were pretty confident with the new M2 chip that you could continue to grow throughout a potential drawdown in that particular market.

 

Do you still feel that way?

And if you can kind of share how you're thinking about the different sort of components of your growth versus the market.

 



Tim Cook

Yes, I wouldn't want to project into this quarter.

 

But for last quarter, what we saw was the -- when the COVID restrictions hit in the Shanghai corridor, we lost the primary source of supply for Mac units.

And that was either running at a reduced rate or down completely for the majority of the quarter.

 

And so it was a very big impact to the Mac business.

We felt good, frankly, that we were able to, by the end of the quarter, get this back to where we were down 10 points.

 

But the negative 10 I would classify as being driven by supply.

And of course, FX feeds into this as well because of the translation issues around the world.

 

There's also some impact because of the business in Russia.

But those are the 3 kind of reasons that I would tell you.

 

In terms of testing the demand, you can't really test the demand unless you have the supply.

And we were so far from that last quarter that we have an estimate of what we believe demand was.

 

But it is an estimate.

We recognize how the industry is doing.

 

We think that we've got a great story with the Mac with getting M1 out and now M2 out.

We have a very, very strong offering for the back-to-school season and we'll see how we do this quarter.

 

We'll report back in October.
Operator

We'll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.

 



Benjamin Bollin

Tim, I was hoping you could share a little bit more about how you're thinking about the supply headwinds.

 

You said less severe or less worse supply challenges into September.

I'm interested when you think you find balance across products.

 

And also, any thoughts on how or when that might influence replenishment of supply into your retail channels?



Tim Cook

To give you a little more color on what we saw in the June quarter, we came in slightly below, from a constraint point of view, the $4 billion number that we had put, at the 4 to 8 are the low end of that range.

 

And the majority of that constraint last quarter was coming out of the COVID restrictions that occurred, that resulted in plant closures and plants running at less than full utilization for some amount of the quarter, in some cases, the majority of the quarter.

And then the other component that is the minority part of it is the silicon shortage that has affected our results for several quarters now.

 

If you look into the future, the silicon shortage, we're not forecasting when that will end.

We think that in the aggregate, our constraint numbers for the September quarter will be less than they were in the June quarter.

 

But of the 2 -- there are these 2 components, and of course, we're optimistic about the COVID restriction piece of this.



Benjamin Bollin

Okay.

 

The other item.

Tim, any thoughts on how you're thinking strategy is evolving with respect to progress in AR, VR in your existing products?

 

Anything you're learning about content or how you're thinking about that opportunity?



Tim Cook

We're thrilled right now to have over 14,000 ARKit apps in the App Store.

 

And they're providing incredible AR experiences for millions of people.

And that's utilizing iPhone and iPad.

 

And of course, we are in the business of innovation so we're always exploring new and emerging technologies.

But I wouldn't want to say anything beyond that.

 
Operator

We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.

 



Wamsi Mohan

Luca, you mentioned revenues to accelerate year-over-year overall in September versus your June growth rate.

 

Would you say that it would be reasonable to assume normal quarter-on-quarter seasonality of about $7 billion or so?

Or would you say there are additional puts and takes this time around that could drive upside and downside to that?

 

I know you noted 600 bps year-over-year on FX as potentially one of those.

But maybe help us think through, on a sequential basis, how much of a normal versus abnormal seasonality we should expect?

 

And I have a follow-up.



Luca Maestri

Yes, Wamsi, as you know, as we said earlier, we're not providing guidance because of all the uncertainty out there.

 

But we have given a few data points.

So one of them, which you've mentioned, approximately 600 basis points of negative foreign exchange.

 

I mean, you do a rough math, it's around $5 billion.

That's a big number right there that is going to affect us, that we are having some impact from the situation in Russia and that is obviously different from normal seasonality as well.

 

Our supply constraints, as Tim just said, are going to be lower than what we've seen in the June quarter but they're still going to be there.

So when you look at those 3 headwinds and you combine them with the acceleration that we talked about, we feel that, that is pretty remarkable.

 



Wamsi Mohan

Okay, Luca.

 

And Tim, I wanted to follow up on your comment about the macro impact that you've seen on wearables.

Your wearables portfolio is probably at the lowest ASP range across your product portfolio.

 

As you're giving this guidance or directional guidance here, how much of an impact are you assuming in potentially any macro-related slowdowns across the rest of the portfolio?

Why would investors not think that it would be prudent to assume some sort of creep-up of some of these -- some of the hesitation maybe that the macro environment is driving, particularly as it pertains to your higher ASP products?

 



Tim Cook

Yes.

 

Let me expand a little bit on Wearables, Home and Accessories so that I clearly communicate what we saw.

We saw sort of a cocktail of headwinds on Wearables, Home and Accessories.

 

We saw FX, which we've talked about.

We saw supply constraints, which we've talked about.

 

Of course, there was an impact from the business in Russia.

But in addition to those things, which -- those things affected all the products to some degree, we also had a different launch timing for certain home and accessory products.

 

Like in the year-ago quarter, I think, had AirTag in it.

That's just 1 example of something that announced last year that didn't announce this -- that we didn't have a comparable announcement this year.

 

And in -- so in addition to those 4 items, we believe, based on the data, that there was also a macroeconomic environment hit.

And whether or not that is because they're lower ASPs versus the higher ASPs of a phone, I can't tell you that.

 

I can just tell you that looking at the numbers, there does appear to be headwinds in addition to the 4 items that we can articulate and we believe those to be macroeconomic headwinds.
Operator

We'll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

 



Samik Chatterjee

Great.

 

And congrats on the results in this tough macro.

I guess I wanted to start with China smartphone market here a bit.

 

Tim, I thought you said in response to earlier question that you haven't really seen a material impact from the macro on iPhone yet.

But wondering, did you see an impact of the COVID lockdowns there on demand itself?

 

Or was there a snapback fall in that?

If you can comment about the sort of exit run rate that you saw in that market, following the COVID shutdowns ending there.

 

And I have a follow-up.



Tim Cook

Yes, both things are true.

 

We did see a lower demand based on the COVID lockdowns in the cities the COVID lockdowns affected.

And we did see a rebound in those same cities toward the end of the quarter in the June time frame.

 

And in particular, in the run-up to June 18, which as you know, is a major shopping holiday in China.

We think that the net of that was still a negative, but some of it did rebound by June time frame.

 

The restrictions begin to come off toward the beginning of June, if my memory is correct.



Samik Chatterjee

Okay.

 

And for my follow-up, I know you said you don't want to sort of predict the macro here or be an economist.

But if I go back and look at the sort of OpEx for the last few years, you've been increasing that by a double-digit percentage.

 

And just given the uncertainty that you've talked about in the macro further on this call a lot, how are you thinking about sort of that investment base going forward?

Are you trying to look at areas that where you can sort of pull back?

 

I mean, just in terms of how you're preparing for the uncertainty is I guess the question.



Tim Cook

We believe in investing through the downturn.

 

And so we'll continue to hire people and invest in areas, but we are being more deliberate in doing so in recognition of the realities of the environment.
Operator

We'll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup.

 



James Suva

While I'm calling you on my iPhone 13 Max Pro and loving it, I just wanted to ask you, though, with replacement cycles, have you noticed any change now that we've been through like 2.5 years of COVID where people upgrading at a different rate and kind of post COVID, hopefully, upgrade cycles or replacement cycles, how we should kind of think about that?

 

Obviously, when I drop and break my phone, I replace it immediately.

But a normal replacement, have they changed at all?

 

Any insights from that would be great.



Tim Cook

It's challenging to measure the replacement cycle at any point in time with exact precision, and so I'm going to punt on the question a bit.

 

However, our key task is to make a product that everybody loves and that they want to trade in their current phone to get.

And so that's what we are focused on is innovating like crazy and giving somebody something that they really want and see themselves using.

 



James Suva

Okay, that makes sense.

 

Well, then maybe I can ask Luca a question more on the gross margins.

As you look ahead, the supply chain issues, expedited shipping and all of that, do you think probably the September quarter is kind of the worst of FX and all those headwinds and things?

 

Or is there a little bit of timing delays due to your contractual purchase commitments that you do, that maybe your suppliers are looking at higher costs and you're benefiting from some lower contracts or maybe that has already caught up?

If you could give us some insights on the kind of longer-term nature of the directions or the gross margin impacts.

 



Luca Maestri

Jim, I would say we provide guidance for the current quarter.

 

But if we look ahead, there's always a couple of elements in gross margin that are a bit outside of our control and we need to be mindful of that.

One of them is the foreign exchange environment.

 

That is having an impact already for the September quarter, had an impact on June.

And obviously, strong dollar tends to be a headwind for us.

 

As you know, we have a hedging program and so we mitigate that impact.

But over time, those hedges roll off and so it becomes more challenging for us.

 

We'll see what happens with foreign exchange rates over time.

That is going to be a variable that we need to track.

 

The other one that has an impact on the aggregate gross margin is our mix of products and services.

As you know, they have different margin profiles for very different reasons, different businesses, even different accounting treatment at times.

 

And so that is also something that we will need to track over time.

What matters to us, I think it goes back to Tim was saying earlier, is we want to make sure that people love our products and services, and we want all of them to be equally successful in the marketplace.

 

Certainly, as you've seen over the last year, we've had a significant expansion in gross margins in spite of very difficult economic circumstances from COVID to inflation, interest rates going up and our margins have expanded.

From a commodity standpoint, I think you were asking a question around components.

 

Commodities are behaving okay.

We're seeing some price pressure on some silicon components.

 

But other than that, we've -- actually commodities are behaving well.



James Suva

Congratulations to you and all your team members.

 



Tim Cook

Thank you.

 
Operator

We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.

 



Krish Sankar

And Tim, I apologize, it's also macro-related.

 

You mentioned that it impacted digital advertising within Services.

I'm just kind of curious, if the macro does worsen, do you worry about subscriber growth, App Store purchases, et cetera?

 

And conversely, are there any parts of the Service business that you consider recession-proof, like maybe a buy now, pay later or something else?

And then I have a quick follow-up for Luca.

 



Tim Cook

We have incorporated all of our thoughts in the guidance that Luca gave, which says that we think in the aggregate, we're going to accelerate revenues in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter and will decelerate on the Services side.

 

And so we see the digital advertising cloud, if you will, continuing in the current quarter.



Krish Sankar

Got it, got it.

 

Very helpful.

And then a quick follow-up on the lockdown in China during the June quarter.

 

Do you actually see any noticeable negative effects on your App Store revenue for the region or any positive effects like maybe more gaming downloads?



Tim Cook

China had very good results on Services last quarter.

 

And so they grew strong double digit better than the company average, and they set a new June quarter revenue record during the quarter.

Colette Kress

Thanks, Simona.

 

Q3 was an outstanding quarter with revenue of $7.1 billion and year-on-year growth of 50%.

We set records for total revenue as well as for Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization.

 

Starting with Gaming.

Revenue of $3.2 billion was up 5% sequentially and up 42% from a year earlier.

 

Demand was strong across the board.

While we continued to increase desktop GPU supply, we believe channel inventories remain low.

 

Laptop GPUs also posted strong year-on-year growth, led by increased demand for high-end RTX laptops.

NVIDIA RTX technology is driving our biggest ever refresh cycle with gamers, and continues to expand our base with creators.

 

RTX introduced groundbreaking real-time ray tracing and AI-enabled super resolution capabilities, which are getting adopted at an accelerating pace.

More than 200 games and applications now supports NVIDIA RTX, including 125 with NVIDIA DLSS.

 

This quarter alone, 45 new games shipped with DLSS.

And NVIDIA Reflex Latency Reducing Technology is in top esports titles, including Valorant, Fortnite, Apex Legends and Overwatch.

 

In addition, the Reflex ecosystem continues to grow with Reflex technology now integrated in almost 50 gaming peripherals.

NVIDIA studio for creators keeps expanding.

 

Last month at the Adobe MAX Creativity Conference, Adobe announced two powerful AI features for Adobe Lightroom and the Lightroom Classic, accelerated by NVIDIA RTX GPUs.

In addition, several of our partners launched new studio systems, including Microsoft, HP and ASUS.

 

We estimate that a quarter of our installed base has adopted RTX GPUs.

Looking ahead, we expect continued upgrades as well as growth from NVIDIA GeForce users, given rapidly expanding RTX support and the growing popularity of gaming, esports, content creation and streaming.

 

Our GPUs are capable of crypto mining, but we don't have visibility into how much this impacts our overall GPU demand.

In Q3, nearly all of our Ampere architecture gaming desktop GPU shipments were lite hash rate to help steer GeForce supply to gamers.

 

Crypto mining processor revenue was $105 million, which is included in our OEM and other.

Our cloud gaming service, GeForce Now, has two major achievements this quarter.

 

First, Electronic Arts brought more of its hit games to the server.

And second, we announced the new GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership tier, priced at less than $100 for six months.

 

GeForce Now membership has more than doubled in this last year to over 14 million gamers for streaming content from 30 data centers in more than 80 countries.

Moving to Pro Visualization.

 

Q3 revenue of $577 million was up 11% sequentially and up 144% from the year ago quarter.

The sequential rise was led by mobile workstations with desktop workstations also growing, as enterprises deployed systems to support hybrid work environment.

 

Building on the strong initial ramp in Q2, Ampere architecture sales continue to grow, leading verticals, including media and entertainment, healthcare, public sector and automotive.

Last week, we announced general availability of Omniverse Enterprise, a platform for simulating physically accurate 3D world and digital twins.

 

Initial market reception to Omniverse has been incredible.

Professionals at over 700 companies are evaluating the platform, including BMW, Ericsson, Lockheed Martin and Sony Pictures.

 

More than 70,000 individual creators have downloaded Omniverse since the open beta launch in December.

There are approximately 40 million 3D designers in the global market.

 

Moving to Automotive.

Q3 revenue of $135 million declined 11% sequentially and increased 8% from the year ago quarter.

 

The sequential decline was primarily driven by AI cockpit revenue, which has negatively been impacted by automotive manufacturers supply constraints.

We announced that self-driving truck start-up, Kodiak Robotics; auto maker, Lotus; autonomous bus manufacturers, QCraft; and EV start-up, WM Motor, have adopted NVIDIA DRIVE Orin platform for their next-generation vehicles.

 

They join a large and rapidly growing list of companies adopting and developing on NVIDIA DRIVE, including auto OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, NAVs, trucking companies, mobile taxis and software start-ups.

Moving to Data Center.

 

Record revenue of $2.9 billion grew 24% sequentially and 55% from the year ago quarter with record revenue across both hyperscale and vertical industries.

Strong growth was led by hyperscale customers, fueled by continued rapid adoption of Ampere architecture Tensor Core GPUs for both internal and external workloads.

 

Hyperscale compute revenue doubled year-on-year, driven by the scale out of natural language processing and recommendator models and cloud computing.

Vertical industry growth was also strong, led by consumer Internet and broader cloud providers.

 

For example, Barco Cloud deployed NVIDIA GPUs for its launch of AI services, such as tech analysis, speech recognition, computer vision and anomaly detection.

We continue to achieve exceptional growth and influence, which again outpaced our overall Data Center growth.

 

We have transitioned our lineup of infant-focused processes to the Ampere architecture, such as the A30 GPU.

We also released the latest version of our Triton Inference Server software, enabling compute-intensive inference workloads such as large language models to scale across multiple GPUs and nodes with real-time performance.

 

Over 25,000 companies worldwide use NVIDIA AI inference.

A great new example is Microsoft Teams, which has nearly 250 million monthly active users.

 

It uses NVIDIA AI to convert speech to text real time during video calls in 28 languages in a cost-effective way.

We reached three milestones to help drive more mainstream enterprise adoption of NVIDIA AI.

 

First, we announced the general availability of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a comprehensive software suite with AI tools and frameworks that enables the hundreds of thousands of companies running NVIDIA, running vSphere to virtualize AI workloads on NVIDIA-certified systems.

Second, VMware announced a future update to vSphere with Tanzu that is fully optimized for NVIDIA AI.

 

When it's combined with NVIDIA AI enterprise, enterprises can efficiently manage cloud-native AI development and deployment on main stream data center servers and clouds with existing IT tools.

And third, we expanded our launch cloud program globally with ethernet as our first digital infrastructure partner.

 

NVIDIA LaunchPad is now available in nine locations worldwide, providing enterprises with immediate access to NVIDIA software and infrastructure to help them prototype and test data science and AI workloads.

LaunchPad features NVIDIA-certified systems and NVIDIA DGX systems running the entire NVIDIA AI software stack.

 

In networking, revenue was impacted as demand outstripped supply.

We saw momentum toward higher speed and new generation products, including ConnectX-5 and 6.

 

We announced the NVIDIA Quantum-2 400 gigabit per second end-to-end networking platform, consisting of the Quantum-2 switch the ConnectX-7 network adapter and the BlueField-3 DPU.

The NVIDIA Quantum-two, which is available from a wide range of building infrastructure and system vendors around the world.

 

Earlier this week, the latest top 500 list of supercomputers showed continued momentum for our full stack computing approach.

NVIDIA's technologies accelerate over 70% of the systems Muslims on the including over 90% of all new systems and 23 of the top 25 most energy-efficient systems.

 

Turning to GTC.

Last week we hosted our GPU Technology Conference, which had over 270,000 registered attendees.

 

Jensen's keynote has been viewed 25 million times over the past eight days.

While our Spring GTC is focused on new chips and systems, this edition focused on software, demonstrating our full computing stack.

 

Let me cover some of the highlights.

Our vision for Omniverse came to life at GTC.

 

We significantly expanded this ecosystem and announced new capabilities.

Omniverse replication is an engine for producing data to train robots, replicating augment real-world data with massive, diverse and physically accurate synthetic data sets to both accelerate development of high-quality, high-performance AI across computing demand.

 

NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar is our platform for generating interactive AI avatars.

It connects several core NVIDIA SDKs including switch AI, computer vision, natural language understanding, recommendation engines and simulation.

 

Applications including automated customer service, virtual collaboration and content solution.

Replicator ad avatar joined several other announced features and capabilities for Omniverse, including AI, AR, VR and simulation-based technologies.

 

We introduced 65 new and updated software development page, bringing our total to more than 150 serving industries from gaming and design to AI, cybersecurity, 5G and robotics.

One of the STKs is our first four licensed AI model, NVIDIA Riva, for building conversational AI applications.

 

Companies using Riva during the open beta include RingCentral for video conference live captioning and Pig An for customer service chatbots.

NVIDIA Riva Enterprise will be commercially available early next year, for launch.

 

We introduced the NVIDIA's NeMo Megatron optimized for training large language models on NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD infrastructure.

This combination brings together production-ready, enterprise-grade hardware and software in both vertical industries, develop language and industry-specific dropbox, personal systems, content generation and summarization.

 

Early adopters include SiDi, JD.com and VinBrain.

We unveiled BlueField DOCA 1.2, the latest version of our GPU programming lender with new cybersecurity capabilities.

 

DOCA is to our GPUs as CUDA is to our GPUs.

It enables developers to build applications and services on top of our BlueFiled DOCAs.

 

Our new capabilities make BlueField the ideal platform for the industry to build their own zero trust security platforms.

The leading cybersecurity companies are working with us to provision their next-generation firewall service on BlueField, including Checkpoint, Juniper, Borgne, F5, Palo Alto Networks and VMware.

 

And we released Clara Holoscan, a edge AI computing platform for medical instruments to improve decision-making tools in areas such as robo-assisted surgery, interventional radiology and radiation therapy planning.

Other new or expanded SDKs or libraries unveiled at GTC include ReOpt for AI optimized logistics Quantum for quantum computing, Morpheus for cybersecurity, Modulus for physical-based machine learning and Crunet Numeric, a data center scale mass library to bring accelerated computing to the large and growing Python ecosystem.

 

All in, NVIDIA's computing platform continues to expand as a broadening set of SDK enable more and more GPU-accelerated applications and industry use cases.

CUDA has been downloaded 30 million times, and our developer ecosystem is now nearing 3 million strong.

 

The applications they develop on top of our SDK and the cloud to edge computing platform are helping to transform multitrillion dollar industries from healthcare to transportation to mental services, manufacturing, logistics and virtual.

In Automotive, we announced NVIDIA DRIVE Concierge and DRIVE Chauffeur, AI software platforms that enhance a vehicle's performance, features and safety.

 

Live Concierge build on Omniverse Avatar functioned as an AI-based in-vehicle person-assistance, but enables automatic parking, summoning capabilities.

It also enhanced safety by monitoring the driver throughout the duration of the drive.

 

DRIVE Chauffeur offers autonomous capabilities, relieving the driver of constantly having to control the car.

It will also perform address to address driving when combined with DRIVE Hyperion 8 platform.

 

For robotics, we announced Jetson AGX Orin, the world's smallest, most powerful and energy-efficient AI supercomputer for robotics, autonomous mission and embedded computing at the Edge.

Built on our Ampere architecture, Jetson AGX Orin provides 6 times the processing power of its predecessor and delivers 200 trillion operations per second, similar to a GPU-enabled server that fits into the palm of your hand.

 

Jetson AGX Orin will be available in the first quarter of calendar 2022.

Finally, we revealed plans to build Earth-2, the world's most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to confronting climate change.

 

The system would be the climate change counterpart to Cambridge-1, the U.K.'

s most powerful AI supercomputer that we built for corporate research.

 

Earth-2 furnishes all the technologies we've invented up to this moment.

Let me discuss Arm.

 

I'll provide you a brief update on our proposed acquisition of Arm.

Arm with NVIDIA is a great opportunity for the industry and customers with NVIDIA's scale, capabilities and robust understanding of data center computing, acceleration and AI.

 

We assessed Arm in expanding their reach into data center, IOT and PCs and advanced Arm's IP for decades to come.

The combination of our companies can enhance competition in the industry as we work together on further building the world of AI.

 

Regulators at the U.S.

FTC have expressed concerns regarding the transaction and we are engaged in discussions with them regarding remedies to address those concerns.

 

The transactions has been under review by China Antitrust Authority, pending the formal case initiation.

Regulators in the U.K.

 

and the EU have declined to approve the transaction in Phase 1 of their reviews on competition concerns.

In the U.K., they have also voiced national security concerns.

 

We have begun the Phase 2 process in the EU and U.K.

jurisdictions.

 

Despite these concerns and those raised by some Arm licensees, we continue to believe in the merits and the benefits of the acquisition to Arm, to its licensees and to the industry.

We believe these concerns and those raised by some Arm licensees -- we continue to believe in the merits and benefits of the ongoing acquisition.

 

Moving to the rest of the P&L.

GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was up 260 basis points from a year earlier, primarily due to higher end mix within desktop, notebook, GeForce GPUs.

 

The year-on-year increase also benefited from a reduced impact of acquisition-related costs.

GAAP gross margin was up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by growth in our Data Center Ampere architecture products, which is particularly offset by mix in gaming.

 

Non-gaming gross margin was up 150 basis points from a year earlier and up 30 basis points sequentially.

Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.97, 83% from a year earlier.

 

Non-GAAP EPS was $1.17, up 60% from a year ago, adjusting for our stock split.

Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion, up from $1.3 billion a year earlier and down from $2.7 billion in the prior quarter.

 

The year-on-year increase primarily reflects higher operating income, particularly offset by prepayment for long-term supply agreement.

Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.

 

We expect sequential growth to be driven by Data Center and Gaming, more than offsetting a decline in CMP.

Revenue is expected to be $7.4 billion plus or minus 2%.

 

GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.3% and 67%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.

GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.02 billion and $1.43 billion, respectively.

 

GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $60 million, excluding gains and losses on non-affiliated investments.

GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 11%, plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items.

 

Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million to $275 million.

Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary.

 

Other information is also available on our IR website.

In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community.

 

We will be attending the Credit Suisse 25th Annual Technology Conference in person on November 30th.

We will also be at the Wells Fargo Fifth Annual TMT Summit virtually on December 1st, the UBS Global TMT Virtual Conference on December 6th, and the Deutsche Bank Virtual Auto Tech Conference on December 9th.

 

Our earnings call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 results is scheduled for Wednesday, February 16.

With that, we will now open the call for questions.

 

Operator, will you please poll for the questions.
Operator

[Operator Instructions] For our first question, we have Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.

 

Aaron, your line is open.



Aaron Rakers

Yes.

 

Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the results.

I guess, I wanted to ask about Omniverse.

 

Obviously, a lot of excitement around that.

I guess the simple question is, Jensen, how do you define success in Omniverse as we look out over the next, let's call it, 12 months and how do we think about the subscription license opportunity for Omniverse.

 

I know you've talked about $40 million total 3D designers, I think that actually doubled what you talked about back in August.

So I'm just curious of how we at finance line should probably think about that opportunity materializing?

 



Jensen Huang

Yes.

 

Thanks.

Omniverse success will be defined by, number one, developer engagement, connecting with developers around the world; two, applications being developed by enterprises; three, the connection -- designers and creators among themselves.

 

Those are the nearest term -- and I would say that in my type of definition, etc.

Near term also, it should be revenues and Omniverse has real immediate applications as I demonstrated at the keynote and I'll highlight a few of them right now.

 

One of them, of course, is that it serves as a way to connect 3D and digital design world.

Think of Adobe as a world, think of the Autodesk as a world, think of Revit as a world.

 

These are design world in the sense that people are doing things in it, they are creating things in it and they have to run database.

We made it possible for these worlds to be connected for the very first time and for it to be shared like in cloud documents.

 

That's not been possible ever before and we can now share work with each other, you can see each other's work, you can collaborate.

And so in the world of remote working, Ominverse's collaboration capability is going to be really appreciated and that should happen right away.

 

We would like to see that happen in very near term.

And that drives of course, more PC sales, more GPU sales, more workstation sales, more server sales.

 

The second use case is digital twins.

And we show in these following examples of how several companies using Omniverse to create a digital twin of a city so that they could optimize radio placements and radio energy used for beamforming.

 

You saw BMW using it for their factories.

You're going to see people using it for warehouse, logistics warehouse to plan and to optimize their warehouses and deploying the robots.

 

And so digital twin applications are absolutely immediate.

And then remember, robots has several clients.

 

There is the physical robot that you saw and a physical robot would be a self-driving car and physical robots would be the car itself, turning it into a robot, so that it could be an intelligent assistant.

But I demonstrated probably the -- in my explanation, the largest application of robots in the future and its avatars.

 

We built Omniverse Avatars to make it easy for people to integrate some amazing technology for computer vision, for speech recognition, natural language understanding, gesture recognition, facial animation and speech synthesis, recommender systems, all of that integrated into one system and running in real time.

That Avatar system is essentially a robotic system and the way that you use that is, for example, with $25 million or so retail stores, restaurant, places like airports and train stations, office buildings and such, where you're going to have intelligent Avatars doing a lot of assistance.

 

They might be doing check out, they might be doing check in, they might be doing customer support and all of that can be done with Avatars, as I've demonstrated.

So the virtual robotics application, digital buys of Avatars, it is going to be likely the largest robotics opportunity.

 

So if you look at our licensing model, the way it basically works is that inside Omniverse is one of the main users and the main users could be one of the 20 million creators or 20 million designers and the 40 million creators and designers around the world and they share Omniverse, each one of the main users would be a $1,000 per user per year.

But don't forget that intelligent use or intelligent users that have been connected through Omniverse will likely be much larger as digital buyers than humans.

 

So I mentioned 40 million, but there are 100 million cars.

And these 100 million cars will have the capability to have something like in Omniverse Avatar and so those 100 million cars could be $1,000 per car per year.

 

And in the case of the 25 million or so places where you would have a digital avatar as customer support or check out smart retail or smart warehouses or smart whatever it is, those avatars also would each individually be a new account and so they would be $1,000 per Avatar per year.

And so those are the immediate tangible opportunities for us and I demonstrate the applications in related keynotes.

 

And then of course behind all of that, call it a couple of hundred million digital agents, intelligent agents, some of them humans, some of them robots, some of them Avatars adds $1,000 per agent per year.

Behind it are, NVIDIA GPUs in PC, NVIDIA GPU in cloud, and NVIDIA GPUs in Omniverse servers.

 

And my guess would be that the hardware part of it is probably going to be about half and then the licensing part of it is probably about half of the time.

So this is really going to be one of the largest graphics opportunities that we've ever seen.

 

And the reason why it's taken so long for us to manifest is because it requires three fundamental technologies to come together, I guess four fundamentals technologies to come together.

First of all, it's video graphic; second is physics simulation, because we're talking about things in world that has to be believable, so it has to obey the laws of physics; and then third is artificial intelligence, as I demonstrated and illustrated just now.

 

And all of it runs on top of an Omniverse computer that has to do not just AI, not just physics, not just computer graphics, but all of it.

And so long term why people are so excited about it is, at the highest level what it basically means is that that long-term when we engage in that, which is largely 2D today, long-term every query would be 3D and instead of just querying information, we would query and interact with people and Avatars and things and places and all of these things are in 3D.

 

So hopefully one of these days that we will probably realize it as fast as we can every transaction that goes on to internet touches a GPU and today that's a very small percentage, but hopefully one of these days it will be a bit of a high percentage.

So I hope that's helpful.

 
Operator

For our next question, we have Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.

 

Mark, your line is open.



Mark Lipacis

Hi.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

Jensen, it seems like every year there seems to be a new set of demand drivers for your accelerated platform, accelerated processing ecosystem, there's gaming, then neural network and AI and then blockchain and then ray tracing.

 

And five or six years ago, you guys showed a bunch of virtual reality demos, which were really exciting at your Analyst Day, excitement died down, now it seems to be resurfacing particularly with Omniverse Avatar capability and Facebook shedding light on the opportunities.

So the two questions from that are, how close is your Omniverse Avatar to morphing into like a mass market technology that everybody uses daily?

 

You talk about like -- you said that everybody is going to be a gamer, everybody is going to be a Omniverse Avatar user.

And maybe the bigger picture is, is it reasonable to think about new killer app coming out every year?

 

Is there a parallel that we should think about with previous computing markets that we could think about for the computing area that we're entering right now?

Thank you.

 



Jensen Huang

Yes.

 

I really appreciate that.

Chips are enablers, but chips don't create markets, software creates market.

 

At this point, I explain over the years that accelerated computing is very different than general purpose computing and the reason for that is because you can't just write into compiler and compile quantum physics into a chip.

I mean, it doesn't.

 

You can't just compile Schrodinger's equation and have it distributed across multiple GPUs, multiple nodes and have a new SaaS.

You just -- you can't do that for computer graphics, you can't do that for artificial intelligence, you can't do that for robotics, you can't do that for the most of the interesting applications in the world and because we really run out of steam with GPUs and that people are saying that not because it's not true, it is abundantly clear that the amount of instruction in parallel that you can squeeze out of a system is although not zero is incredibly hard, it's just incredibly hard.

 

And there is another approach and we have been advocating accelerated computing for some time and now people really see the benefit of it, but it does requires a lot of work and yet the work basically says for every domain, for every application we have -- for every application in large domain that you'll use, you have to have a whole stack.

And so whenever you want to open a new market by accelerating those applications or that domain of applications, you have to come up with a new stack and the new stack is hard, because you have to understand the application, you have to understand the algorithms, the mathematics, you have to understand computer science to distribute it across, to take something that was single threaded and make it multi-threaded and make something that we've done sequentially and make it process in parallel.

 

You break everything, you break storage, you break networking, you break everything.

And so it takes a fair amount of expertise and that's why we're saying that over the years, over the course of 30 years we have become a full-stack company, because we've been trying to solve this problem practically through decades.

 

And so that's one.

But the benefit, once you have the ability, then you can open new markets and we played a really large role in democratizing artificial intelligence and making it possible for anybody to be able to do it.

 

Our greatest contribution is I hope when it's all said and done that we democratized scientific computing, so that researchers and scientists, computer scientists, data scientists, scientists of all kinds were able to get access to this incredibly powerful tool that we call computers to do advance research.

And so every single year we're coming up with new stacks and we got a whole bunch of stacks we are working on and many of them are working on in plain sight, so that you see it coming, you just have to connect it together.

 

One of the areas that we spoke about this time, of course, was Omniverse and you saw the pieces of it being built over time, and it took half a decade to start building Omniverse, but it built on a quarter century of work.

In the case of the Omniverse Avatar, you could literally point to MERLIN, the recommender; Megatron, the language -- large language model; Riva, the speech AI, all of our computer vision AIs that have been demonstrating over the years, natural speech synthesis that we see every single year with I AM AI the opening credits, how we're using, developing an AI to be able to speak in a human way so that people feel more comfortable and more engaged with the AI.

 

Face, eye tracking, Maxine and all of these technologies are connected together.

They were all built in pieces, but we integrated it, we have the intentions of integrating it and to create what it's called Omniverse Avatar.

 

And now you asked the question, how quickly will we deploy this?

I believe Omniverse Avatar will be in drive-thrus and restaurants, fast food restaurants, check out with restaurants, in retail stores, all over the world within less than five years.

 

And we're going to need it in all kinds of different applications, because there is such a great shortage of labor and there is such a wonderful way that you can now engage in Avatar and it could -- it doesn't make mistakes, it doesn't get tired and it's always on and we made so that it's cloud native and so when you saw the keynote, I hope you'd agree that the interaction is instantaneous and the conversational forum is so enjoyable.

And so anyway, I think what you highlight is, one, accelerated computing is a full-stack challenge.

 

Two, it takes software to open new markets.

Chips can't open new markets.

 

If you build another chip, you can steal somebody's share, but you can't open new market and it takes software to open new market.

NVIDIA switch with software, and that's one of the reasons why we could integrate such large market opportunities.

 

And then last with respect to Omniverse, I believe it's a near-term opportunity that we've be working on for some three, four, five years.
Operator

For our next question, we have C.J.

 

Muse from Evercore ISI.

C.J., your line is open.

 



C.J. Muse

Yes.

 

Good afternoon.

Thank you for taking the question.

 

And I guess not an Omniverse question, but I guess, Jensen, I'd like your commitment that you will not use Omniverse to target the sell-side research industry.

As my real question, can you speak to your Data Center visibility into 2022 and beyond?

 

And within this outlook, can you talk to traditional cloud versus industry verticals and then perhaps emerging opportunities like Omniverse and others?

Would love to get a sense of kind of what you're seeing today.

 

And then as part of that, how you're planning to secure foundry and other supply to support that growth?

Thank you.

 



Jensen Huang

Thank you, C.J.

 

First of all, we have secured guaranteed supply, very large amounts of it, quite a spectacular amount of it from the world's leading foundry in substrate and packaging and testing certain companies, the integral part of our supply chain.

And so we have done that and feel very good about our supply situation, particularly starting in the second half of this year and going forward.

 

I think this whole last year was a wakeup call for everybody to be much more mindful about not taking the supply chain for granted and we were fortunate to have such good partners, but nonetheless we've secured our future.

With respect to Data Center, about half of our Data Center business comes from the cloud and cloud service providers and the other half comes from enterprise, what we call enterprise companies and they're in all kinds of industries.

 

And about 1% of it comes from supercomputing centers, because so 50% or so cloud, 50% or so enterprise and 1% supercomputing centers.

And we expect next year, the cloud, the cloud service providers to scale out their deep learning and their AI workloads really aggressively and we're seeing that right now.

 

We built a really fantastic platform and -- number one.

Number two, the work we've been doing with TensorRT, which has the run time that goes into the server that's called Triton is one of our best pieces of work.

 

We're just so proud of it.

And we said nearly four years ago, three-and-half years ago that Inference is going to be one of the great computer science challenges, and it's really proving to be so.

 

And the reason for that is, because sometimes it's throughput, sometimes it's latency, sometimes interactivity on the type of models we have with Inference.

It's just all over the map, it's not just computer vision or image recognition, it's all over the map.

 

And the reason for that is there's many different types of architectures, there's so many different ways to build different applications and so the application is complicated.

And finally there is just a wonderful people working.

 

We're now on our 8th generation on that.

It's adopted all over the world.

 

Some 25,000 companies are now using NVIDIA AI and recently at GTC we announced two very, very big things.

One, we remind everybody that we -- just this month before we have tried to support now just in every generation of NVIDIA GPUs, of which there are so many versions to be managing without trying how would you possibly deploy AI across the entire fleet of NVIDIA servers, NVIDIA GPU servers that are all over world and so it's almost an essential tool just to operate and take advantage of all of NVIDIA's GPU that are in datacenter.

 

Two, we support CPUs.

And so it's no longer necessary for someone to have two Inference servers.

 

You can just have one Inference servers, because the NVIDIA version is already essential.

Now everybody could just use Triton and every single server in the Data Center could be part of the Inference capacity and then we did something else that was really big deal at GTC, which is the so-called Forced Inference Library, called FIL, that basically the most popular machine learning systems in Inference models are based on trees and decision trees and boosted gradient trees and people might know it as XGBoost.

 

And trees all over the place, in fraud detection, in recommender systems and utilized in companies all over the world, because it's just self-explanatory.

You can build upon it, you don't worry about regressions.

 

It could build bigger and bigger trees.

And we -- this GTC we announced that we support that as well.

 

And so all of the sudden, all of that workflow that runs on CPU is not only do they run on Triton, it becomes accelerated.

And the last -- the next thing that NVIDIA will announce, with the tremendous interest in large language models, Triton now also supports multi-GPU and multi-node Inference, so that we could take something like an OpenAI GPT-3, NVIDIA Megatron 530B or anybody's giant model that's been developed all over the world in all these different languages, in all these different domains, in all these different fields of science and what -- in industry where we can now influence it in real time.

 

And I demonstrated it in one of the demos, there was a question answering model that the team built and it was able to basically answer questions in real-time.

And so that is just a giant venture and these are the type of workloads that's going to make it possible for us to continue to scale out and build on these, so.

 

So back to your original question, I think next year is going to be quite a good year for Data Center.

Customers are very mindful of securing their supply for their scale out and so we have a fair amount of visibility and more visibility commonly than ever at Data Center, but in addition to that, Triton is just in adoption everywhere.

 

And then, finally, our brand-new workloads, which is built on top of AI and graphics and simulation, which is Omniverse, and we saw the examples that I gave, these are real companies doing real work and one of the areas that has severe shortages around the world is customer support, just genuine severe shortages all over the world, and we think the answer is Omniverse Avatar.

And it runs in Data Center, you could easily adapt Omniverse Avatar to do drive-thrus or retail check out or customer service, and I demonstrated that with Tokyo, a parking kiosk.

 

You can use it for a tele-operated customer service and we've demonstrated that with Maxine and we demonstrated how you could use it even for video conferencing.

And then lastly, we demonstrated how we could use Omniverse Avatar for robotics, for example, to create a continues work what we call DRIVE Concierge where the car is turned into intelligent customer support, intelligent agent.

 

I think Omniverse Avatar is going to be a really exciting driver for enterprise this next year.

And so next year is going to be a pretty terrific year for Data Center.

For our next question, we have Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.

 

Stacy, your line is open.



Stacy Rasgon

Hi, guys.

 

Thanks for taking my questions.

I wanted to ask two of them on Data Center, both near term and then maybe a little longer term.

 

On the near-term, Colette, you suggested guidance in the Q4 be driven by Data Center and gaming and you mentioned data center first.

Does that mean that it's bigger?

 

If you could just help us like parse the contribution of each into Q4?

And then in the next year, given the commentary for the last question, again it sounds like you've got like a very strong outlook for Data Center both from hyperscale and enterprise.

 

If I look at sort of the implied guidance you gave, Data Center for you is probably likely to grow 50% year-over-year in this fiscal year.

Would it be crazy to think given all the drivers that it could grow by a similar amount next year as well?

 

Like, how should we be thinking about that given all of the drivers that you've been laying out?



Colette Kress

Okay.

 

Thanks, Stacy, for the question.

Let's first focus in terms of our guidance for Q4.

 

Our statements that we made were, yes, about driven by revenue growth from Data Center and Gaming sequentially.

We can probably expect our Data Center to grow faster than our Gaming, probably both in terms of percentage wise and in absolute dollars.

 

We also expect our CMP product to decline quarter-on-quarter to very negligible levels in Q4.

So I hope that gives you a color on Q4.

 

Now in terms of next year, we'll certainly turn the corner into the new fiscal year.

We certainly provide guidance one quarter out.

 

We've given you some great discussions here about the opportunities in front of us, opportunities with the hyperscales, the opportunities with the verticals.

Omniverse is a full stack opportunity in front of us.

 

We are securing supply for next year, not just for the current year and Q4, to allow us to really grow into so much of this opportunity going forward.

But at this time, we're going to wait until next year to provide guidance.

 



Stacy Rasgon

Got it.

 

That's helpful.

I appreciate it.

 

Thank you
Operator

For the next question we have Vivek Arya from BofA Securities.

 

Vivek, your line is open.



Vivek Arya

Thanks for taking my question.

 

Actually I had two quick ones.

And so, Colette, you suggested the inventory purchase and supply agreements are up, I think, almost 68% year-on-year.

 

Does that provide some directional correlation with how you are preparing for growth over the next 12 to 24 months?

So that's one question.

 

And then the bigger question, Jensen, that I have for you is, where are we in the AI adoption cycle?

What percentage of servers are accelerated in hyperscale and vertical industry today and where can those ratios get to?

 



Colette Kress

Thanks for the question.

 

So let's first start in terms of supply or supply purchase agreement.

You have noted that we are discussing that we have made payments toward some of those commitments.

 

Not only are we procuring for what we need in the quarter, what we need next year and again we are planning for growth next year, so we have been planning that supply purchases, we are also doing long-term supply purchases.

These are areas of capacity agreements and/or many of our different suppliers.

 

We made a payment within this quarter of approximately $1.6 billion out of total long-term capacity agreement of about $3.4 billion.

So we still have more payments to make and we were likely continue to be purchasing longer term to support our growth that we are planning for many years to come.

 



Jensen Huang

Every single server will be GPU accelerated some day.

 

Today of all the clouds and all the enterprise, less than 10%.

That kind of give you a sense of where you are.

 

In terms of the workloads, it is also consistent with that in the sense that that a lot of the workloads still only run on CPUs, which is the reason why in order for us to grow, we have to be a full stack company and we have to go find applications, we now have to find plenty of it, focus on the application that require acceleration or benefits tremendously from acceleration that if they were to get a million X speed up, which sounds insane but it's not.

Mathematically I can prove it to you and historically I can even demonstrate it to you that in many areas we have seen million X speed up and has completely revolutionized those industries, computer graphics is of course one of them.

 

Omniverse would not be possible without it.

And so the work that we're doing with digital biology, protein synthesis, which is likely going to be one of the large industries of the world that doesn't exist today at all.

 

Protein engineering and the protein economy is likely going to be very, very large.

You can't do that unless you are able to get million X speed up in the simulation of protein biology.

 

And so those are -- and not to mention some of the most imperative comps that we have to build and engage.

Climate science needs million X, billion X speed up and we are at a point where we can actually tackle that.

 

And so in each one of these cases we have performed, we have to focus our resources to go and accelerate those applications and that translates to growth.

Until then, they run on GPUs.

 

And we look at a lot of today speech synthesis and speech recognition system, it still uses fairly traditional or mixture of traditional and deep learning approaches for speech AI.

NVIDIA Riva is the world's first, I believe, that is end to end deep neural network.

 

And we've worked with many companies in helping them advance there, so that they could move their clouds to our neural-based approaches.

But that's one of the reasons why we do it, so that we could provide the reference, but we can also license it to enterprises around the world, so that they could advance it for their own use cases.

 

And so one application after another we have to get it accelerated, one domain after another we have to get it accelerated.

One of the ones that we're excited about and something that we've been working on for so long is EDA, even our own industry, Electronic Design Automation, for the very first time we announced the EDA using GPU accelerated computing, whether it's because of the artificial intelligence capability, because EDA is very large combinatorial optimization program and using artificial intelligence you could really improve the design quality and design time.

 

So we're seeing from all the major game vendors, from chip design to simulation to PCB design and optimization, design synthesis, moving toward artificial intelligence and GPU acceleration in a very significant.

And then we see that with a mechanical CAD and traditional CAD application now also jumping on to GPU acceleration is getting very significant speed ups.

 

And so I'm super excited about the work that we're doing in each one of these domains.

Because every time you do it, you open up brand new market and customers that never used NVIDIA GPUs now can, because ultimately people don't buy chips, it cannot solve problems.

 

Without a full stack, without software expertise, you can't really commence the enabling technology, what the chip provide and ultimately solve the customers' problems.
Operator

Your final question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.

 

Timothy, your line is open.



Timothy Arcuri

Thanks a lot.

 

Colette, I had a question about gross margin.

Are there any margin headwinds maybe on the wafer pricing side that we should sort of think about normalizing out, because gross margin is pretty flat between fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q4.

 

But I imagine that's kind of masking a strong underlying margin growth, especially as Data Center has been actually driving that growth.

So I'm wondering if maybe there are some underlying factors that are sort of gating gross margin?

 

Thanks.



Colette Kress

Yes.

 

So we have always been working on our gross margin and being able to absorb a lot of the cost changes along the way, architecture-to-architecture really.

So that's always based into our gross margin.

 

Our gross margins right now are largely stable.

Our incremental revenue, for example, what we're expecting next quarter will likely align to our current gross margin levels that we finished in terms of Q3.

 

Our largest driver always continues to be mix.

We have a lot of different mix that has driven related to the high-end AI and RTX solutions, for example, and the software that is embedded in solutions have allowed us to increase our gross margin.

 

As we look forward long-term, software if sold separately can be another driver of gross margin increases in the future.

But cost changes, cost increases are -- generally been a part of our gross margin figures.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

I will now turn the call over back to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.



Jensen Huang

Thank you.

 

We had an outstanding quarter.

Demand for NVIDIA AI is strong with hyperscalers and cloud services deploying at scale and enterprises broadening adoption.

 

We now help more than 25,000 companies that are using NVIDIA AI.

And with NVIDIA AI enterprise software suite, our collaboration with VMware and our collaboration with Equinix to place NVIDIA LaunchPad across the world, every enterprise has an easy arm length to NVIDIA AI.

 

Gaming and Pro Vis are surging.

RTX opportunity continues to expand with the growing market of gamers, creators, designers and now professionals building home workstations.

 

We are working hard to increase supply for the overwhelming demand this holiday season.

Last week, GTC showcased the expanding universe of NVIDIA accelerated computing.

 

In combination with AI and Data Center scale computing, the model we pioneered is on the cusp of producing million X speed ups that will revolutionize many important fields; already AI and upcoming robotics, digital biology and what I hope climate science.

GTC highlighted our full stack expertise in action, built on CUDA and our acceleration libraries in data processing, in simulation, graphics, artificial intelligence, market and domain specific software is needed to solve customer problems.

 

We also showed how software opens new growth opportunities for us.

But the chips are the enablers, but it's the software that opens new growth opportunities.

 

NVIDIA has 150 SDKs now addressed in many of the world's largest end markets.

One of the major themes of this GTC was Omniverse, our simulation platform for virtual worlds and digital twin.

 

Our body of work and expertise in graphics, physics simulation, AI, robotics and full stack computing made Omniverse possible.

At GTC, we showed how Omniverse is used to reinvent collaborative design, customer service avatars and video conferencing and digital twin to factories, processing plants and even entire cities.

 

This is just the tip of the iceberg of what's to come.

We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Thank you.

 

I will now turn over to Jensen for closing remarks.



Simona Jankowski

Well, I think we just heard the closing remarks.

 

Thank you so much for joining us.

We look forward to seeing everybody at the conferences that we have planned over the next few months and I'm sure we'll talk before the end of next earnings.

 

Thanks again, everybody.

And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya.



Satya Nadella

Thank you, Brett.

 

It was a record third quarter, driven by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $23 billion in revenue, up 32% year-over-year.

Going forward, digital technology will be the key input that powers the world’s economic output.

 

Across the tech stack, we are expanding our opportunity and taking share as we help customers differentiate, build resilience, and do more with less.

Now I’ll highlight examples, starting with Azure.

 

We are building a distributed computing fabric across the cloud and the edge to help every organization build, run, and manage mission-critical workloads anywhere.

This quarter, we helped more customers than ever simplifying and accelerating their cloud migrations.

 

And it’s still early days.

We are winning Tier 1 infrastructure workloads.

 

Leaders in every industry, from Blackrock, to Bridgestone, to Lufthansa, are all moving mission-critical workloads to Azure.

And we are the market leader for customers’ SAP workloads in the cloud.

 

Atos, Chevron, Fujitsu, and Woolworths all migrated their SAP applications to Azure in recent months.

Overall, we are seeing larger, more strategic Azure commitments, from industry leaders, including Boeing, Kraft Heinz, US Bank, and Westpac, who all chose our cloud to accelerate their digital transformations.

 

The number of $100 million-plus Azure deals more than doubled year-over-year.

And we’re seeing consumption growth across every industry, customer segment, and geography.

 

Now, to data and AI.

Our data stack is unique in bringing best-in-class operational databases, analytics, and governance into one integrated data fabric.

 

Cosmos DB transactions and data volume increased over 100% year-over-year for the third quarter in a row.

Synapse data volume more than doubled year-over-year.

 

And we’re seeing strong adoption of Purview, as we help organizations govern, protect, and manage their data estate across platforms and clouds.

From Deutsche Boerse to EY, customers in every industry are using our end-to-end data platform.

 

In AI, we continue to see strong usage of Azure Machine Learning.

The number of monthly inference requests increased 86% year-over-year, with companies like PepsiCo using the service to predict which products are most likely to sell.

 

And our Azure Open AI Service brings together advanced language models with the enterprise capabilities of Azure, helping companies like CarMax turn customer reviews into customized content for shoppers.

Now, to developer tools.

 

From Azure DevOps and GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer SaaS service.

Increasingly, every new developer project starts with our tools.

 

Visual Studio has more than 31 million monthly active users, including most of the Fortune 500.

And GitHub usage is increasing among both independent developers and startups, as well as the world’s most established enterprises.

 

90% of the Fortune 100 use GitHub.

In fact, Mercedes Benz, for example, is using GitHub Enterprise to provide a unified development platform for more than 20,000 employees to build, ship, and maintain software.

 

Now, on to Power Platform.

Power Platform has become the leading business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts in every industry.

 

Power Platform surpassed $2 billion in revenue over the past twelve months, up 72% year-over-year, making it one of the fastest growing businesses, at scale.

Power Apps is the market leader in low code/no code app development, and Power BI has more than 200,000 customers.

 

And our acquisition of MINE-it adds new process mining capabilities, helping organizations identify bottlenecks and opportunities for operational efficiency.

Now, to Dynamics 365.

 

Dynamics 365 is growing faster than the business applications market overall.

For example, in a world of supply chain constraints we are helping companies like Cracker Barrel and Unilever predict disruptions before they happen.

 

Businesses like Heineken and Siemens are turning to Dynamics 365 to drive and deliver more consistent and personalized customer engagement and service.

We are leading innovation in the new industrial metaverse to help companies optimize their operations using technologies such as IOT, Digital Twins, Connected Spaces, and Mixed Reality applications.

 

And we’re further differentiating the Microsoft Cloud by bringing together Dynamics 365, Teams, and Synapse to usher in a new era of collaborative applications that transform every business function and process.

When it comes to industry, our six industry clouds, are helping customers speed time to value.

 

Our Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last month, where we introduced Azure Health Data Services to unify disparate clinical, imaging, and medtech data.

Cleveland Clinic will use the solution to normalize data from different systems and integrate insights into the clinician workflow.

 

And with our acquisition of Nuance, I’m excited about our opportunity to apply the company’s deep enterprise AI expertise to accelerate the growth of both Nuance’s business, and our industry clouds.

Now, on to LinkedIn.

 

We once again saw record engagement, as more than 830 million professionals used the platform to connect, learn, grow, and get hired.

Amid the Great Reshuffle, we’re seeing a skills-first labor market emerge.

 

The number of companies using skills filters on LinkedIn to fill open roles has doubled year-over-year.

In this dynamic labor market, hires on LinkedIn has increased 88%.

 

Talent Solutions revenue was up 43%, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth.

Our Marketing Solutions business continues to thrive as we offer advertisers high reach and ROI.

 

And creators are increasingly turning to the platform to establish their voices and grow their communities, using tools like Newsletters to share content they are passionate about.

28 million members now subscribe to at least one newsletter on LinkedIn, up 51% over the past quarter alone.

 

Now, on to Microsoft 365 and Teams.

The last two years have proven that every organization needs a digital fabric that connects the entire organization, from the boardroom to the frontline, to customers and partners.

 

No company is better positioned to meet this need than Microsoft, with Microsoft 365 and Teams.

Teams is the most used and most advanced platform for work, and the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and business process automation.

 

And organizations from enterprises to SMBs are relying on Teams to run their business.

Our comprehensive approach reduces complexity and costs.

 

Microsoft 365 customers can save as much as 60%, compared to a patchwork of single point identity, productivity, collaboration, and meetings solutions.

Teams usage has never been higher.

 

We’re seeing growth in every segment, including very small businesses with Teams Essentials.

Teams is the leading platform for collaborative apps.

 

From Asana to Zendesk, there are over 1,000 third-party apps available the Teams app store.

And companies in every industry, including CBRE, CVS Health, and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, have built custom line of business apps within Teams, bringing business process directly into the flow of work.

 

And we’re adding new growth engines to meet the demands of hybrid work with Teams Rooms, Teams Phone, and Microsoft Viva.

Teams Rooms is bridging the gap between people working remotely and those in the office, with innovations like Front Row.

 

Teams Phone with Operator Connect enables organizations to easily bring their existing calling service to Teams.

Total Operator Connect minutes increased 8x quarter-over-quarter.

 

And Viva has more than 10 million monthly active users at companies like Blum, Cerner, and Marks & Spencer.

This quarter, we added LinkedIn’s Glint employee engagement tool to Viva, ensuring leaders can more easily solicit employee feedback and receive actionable insights.

 

All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365.

Organizations across the private and public sector, including American Family Insurance, the Queensland Government, and Telefonica are increasingly choosing our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics.

 

Now, on to Windows.

The PC has never been more relevant to work, life, and play.

 

The number of use cases is increasing as is the amount of time spent on PCs.

More than 100 million PCs have shipped in each of the last eight quarters, and Windows continues to take share.

 

With Windows 11, we continue to see the highest quality scores of any version of the operating system.

The enterprises are adopting Windows 11 at a faster pace than any previous release.

 

With Windows 365, we’re bringing the power of Azure computing to Windows computers, enabling businesses like Lands’ End, SES, and Xerox to stream the full Windows experience to any employee device.

New integrations between Windows 11 and Windows 365 will make it possible to switch between Cloud PC and the local PC with a single click.

 

And we continue to help organizations like AIG, Grant Thornton, and Sage shift their on-premise virtualization services to the cloud with Azure Virtual Desktop.

In consumer, Windows is key to curating our content and services to help every person with their everyday tasks, from browsing and searching, to learning, and gaming, and shopping, all with security and privacy built-in.

 

We are seeing strong engagement, with nearly 500 million monthly active users of our personalized content feed, Microsoft Start.

As usage continues to grow, we are seeing a flywheel emerge between content, consumption, and commerce, as we generate new opportunities for content creators, as well as advertisers.

 

And our browser, Microsoft Edge, continues to gain share as we help people save money and shop securely.

Now, to security.

 

Security is a top priority for every organization undergoing a digital transformation.

To keep our customers secure, we build security by design into every product we sell.

 

And we deliver end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, device management, and privacy, across clouds and platforms, informed by 24 trillion threat signals each day.

This comprehensive capability has been critical during the recent world events, and we continue to disrupt cyber attacks and share threat intelligence with the Ukrainian government, as well as other public sector agencies.

 

Multi-cloud, multi-platform support is central to our approach.

In security, we are the only cloud provider with native multi-cloud protection for the industry’s top three cloud platforms.

 

In identity, we now provide permissions management across all clouds.

Azure Active Directory is the undisputed market leader with more than 550 million monthly active users.

 

In management, the number of Windows, Android, and iOS devices protected by Intune grew over 60% year-over-year.

And we’re expanding to new market segments with Microsoft Defender for Business, which helps keep small businesses secure.

 

This innovation and differentiation is driving our overall growth.

All up, the number of customers who trust our security solutions grew nearly 50% year-over-year to 785,000, including Citrix, Domino’s Pizza, Fujitsu, Heineken, Petronas, who rely on us to protect their multi-cloud infrastructure.

 

And we have over 15,000 partners in our security ecosystem, more than anyone else in the industry.

Now, on to gaming.

 

Our ambition is to power gamers to play when, and how, and where they want.

With our Xbox Series S and X consoles, we have taken share globally for two quarters in a row and we are the market leader this quarter among the next gen consoles in the United States, Canada, UK, and Western Europe.

 

And with Xbox Cloud Gaming, we are redefining how games are distributed, played, and viewed.

To date, more than 10 million people have streamed games.

 

Many of our most popular titles, including Flight Simulator are now accessible on phones, tablets, low-spec PCs for the first time.

Our Game Pass library now includes hundreds of titles across PC and console, including more games from third-party publishers than ever before.

 

Billions of hours have been played by subscribers over the past 12 months, up 45%.

And with Azure, we are building the best cloud for game studios of all sizes to build, host, and grow their games.

 

New capabilities speed time to development and to help connect players across platforms.

Azure gaming revenue fiscal year to date increased 66%.

 

In closing, we are entering a new era where every company will become a digital company.

Our portfolio of durable digital businesses and diverse business models, built on a common tech stack, position us well to capture the massive opportunities ahead.

 

With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy.



Amy Hood

Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone.

 

This quarter, revenue was $49.4 billion, up 18% and 21% in constant currency.

Earnings per share was $2.22 and increased 14% and 18% in constant currency when adjusted for the tax benefit from the third quarter of fiscal year 2021.

 

Several items impacted our financial performance that were not included in the guidance provided on our January earnings call.

First, Nuance.

 

My comments today across Q3 results and Q4 outlook include the impact from the Nuance acquisition which closed on March 4.

Our results include $111 million in revenue and a negative $0.01 impact to earnings per share, including purchase accounting, integration, and transaction related expenses.

 

Within our results, unless specifically noted otherwise, Nuance was not a material driver of growth rates.

We continue to expect the Nuance acquisition will be minimally dilutive in FY2022 and accretive in FY2023 to non-GAAP EPS.

 

Second, FX.

The U.S.

 

dollar strengthened throughout the quarter and created an incremental 1 point FX headwind to total company revenue compared to expectations.

As a result, revenue and EPS were negatively impacted by $302 million and $0.03 per share, respectively.

 

Finally, the war in Ukraine.

We suspended all new sales of our products and services in Russia.

 

Revenue generated in Russia represents less than 1% of total company revenue and we expect that it will decline significantly.

The impact to operating income this quarter was roughly $130 million split evenly between lower revenue and higher bad debt expense, resulting in a negative $0.01 impact to EPS.

 

Our results for the quarter are better than we expected across revenue, operating income, and EPS as we again delivered another strong quarter of top and bottom line growth.

In our commercial business, healthy demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings together with excellent execution by our sales teams and partners drove increased commitment to our platform as well as higher usage of our services that Satya mentioned earlier.

 

Commercial bookings increased 28% and 35% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions.

We also saw better than expected growth in large, long-term Azure contracts against a very strong prior year comparable.

 

Nuance benefited bookings by roughly 5 points.

Our on-premises transactional licensing revenue, across both the Office and Server businesses, was more negatively impacted than expected due to the transition from our Open Licensing program to our Cloud Solution Provider program.

 

Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 32% and 34% in constant currency to $155 billion with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within and the portion beyond, the next 12 months.

And our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 96%.

 

Commercial Cloud revenue was $23.4 billion and grew 32% and 35% in constant currency, again ahead of expectations.

Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%.

 

Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, the Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points driven by improvement across the cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure.

In our consumer business, as you heard from Satya, we saw market share gains across PCs, gaming consoles, and our Edge browser.

 

Now back to the company level.

As noted earlier, the U.S.

 

dollar strengthened throughout the quarter.

FX decreased total company revenue by 3 points, 1 point unfavorable to expectations, decreased COGS by 1 point, in line with expectations, and decreased operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations.

 

Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 21% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 68%.

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased approximately 1 point driven primarily by improvement in our cloud services noted earlier.

 

Operating expense increased 15% and 17% in constant currency, slightly lower than expected as investments that shifted to future quarters were partially offset by the inclusion of Nuance.

At a total company level, headcount grew 20% year-over-year as we continue to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering, customer deployment, LinkedIn, and sales, and included approximately 4 points of growth from the addition of Nuance.

 

Operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency and operating margins increased slightly year-over-year to 41%.

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins expanded roughly 2 points year-over-year.

 

Now to our segment results.

Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15.8 billion and grew 17% and 19% in constant currency in line with expectations.

 

Better than expected results across Office 365, LinkedIn, and Office consumer were offset by impacts from incremental FX, the Open Licensing transition, Russia, as well as lower than expected results in Dynamics.

Office commercial revenue grew 12% and 14% in constant currency.

 

Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 20% in constant currency, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU from continued momentum in E5 revenue.

Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 16% year-over-year to nearly 345 million, with continued growth in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings.

 

And nearly 45% of our Office 365 commercial seats were purchased through Microsoft 365.

Office commercial licensing was lower than expected, down 28% and 25% in constant currency, driven by the factors discussed earlier and a lower mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.

 

Office consumer revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 58.4 million.

Dynamics revenue grew 22% and 25% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 35% and 38% in constant currency, substantially faster than the market although a bit lower than expected as we focus on stronger execution on our recent investments.

 

LinkedIn revenue increased 34% and 35% in constant currency, with better than expected performance in Talent Solutions as well as continued strength in Marketing Solutions and record levels of engagement on the platform.

Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 19% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year.

 

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven by improvement across all cloud services.

Operating expense increased 13% and 14% in constant currency, and operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency.

 

Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes approximately four weeks of results from Nuance.

Revenue was $19.1 billion, increasing 26% and 29% in constant currency.

 

Excluding the impact of Nuance and the approximately $150 million greater FX than expected, revenue results were ahead of expectations.

Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 29% and 32% in constant currency.

 

Azure and other cloud services grew 46% and 49% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued strength in our consumption-based services.

The inclusion of Nuance cloud services did not change the Azure constant currency growth rate.

 

In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 25% to over 218 million seats.

In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 5% and 7% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings partially offset by the Open Licensing transition mentioned earlier.

 

The inclusion of Nuance on premises offerings did not change the server constant currency growth rate.

Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, driven by growth in Enterprise Support Services.

 

The inclusion of Nuance professional services impacted the constant currency growth rate by 1 point.

Segment gross margin dollars increased 24% and 27% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year.

 

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point with improvements in Azure partially offset by the sales mix shift to Azure.

Operating expense increased 17% and 19% in constant currency and operating income grew 29% and 33% in constant currency.

 

Now to More Personal Computing.

Revenue was $14.5 billion, increasing 11% and 13% in constant currency, above expectations driven by better than expected performance in search and Windows offset by Surface.

 

FX decreased segment revenue approximately $100 million greater than expected.

Windows OEM revenue increased 11%, with continued strength in the commercial PC market, which has higher revenue per license.

 

Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 14% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 with some benefit from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.

Surface revenue grew 13% and 18% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven by consumer channel, partially offset by strength in commercial.

 

Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 23% and 25% in constant currency, better than expected, benefiting from an increase in search volumes even as we saw headwinds during March from the impact of the war in Ukraine.

And in Gaming, on a high prior year comparable, revenue increased 6% and 8% in constant currency.

 

Xbox hardware revenue was better than expected as increased supply of consoles in quarter drove growth of 14% and 16% in constant currency.

Xbox content and services revenue grew 4% and 6% in constant currency, below expectations, driven by lower engagement across the platform, even as it remains above pre-pandemic levels.

 

Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly.

Operating expenses increased 17% and 18% in constant currency and operating income grew 7% and 10% in constant currency.

 

Now back to total company results.

Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6.3 billion, in line with expectations.

 

Cash paid for PP&E was $5.3 billion.

Cash flow from operations was $25.4 billion, increasing 14% as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to hardware inventory builds as we manage continued uncertainty in the supply chain.

 

Free cash flow was $20.0 billion, up 17%.

This quarter, other income and expense was negative $174 million, lower than anticipated driven by net losses on investments, including mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio, and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement.

 

Equity market declines drove net investment losses this quarter compared to net investment gains last year, a negative 2-point impact on year-over-year EPS growth.

Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%.

 

And finally, we returned $12.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

Now, before we turn to our outlook, a few reminders.

 

First, FX; with the stronger U.S.

dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total company revenue growth by approximately 2 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point.

 

Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 3 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and 2 points in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing.

Second, my remarks for the next quarter include a full quarter of impact from the Nuance acquisition.

 

Third, we anticipate the war in Ukraine to continue to impact our business in Q4 with a roughly $110 million impact on revenue and minimal impact on operating expenses.

Next, we have taken into account the current impact of shutdowns in China in our outlook.

 

However, extended production shutdowns that reach into May would further negatively impact our outlook across Windows OEM, Surface, and Xbox hardware.

Finally, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a USD basis.

 

With that context in place, let’s turn to our Q4 outlook.

In our largest quarter of the year we expect our differentiated market position, customer demand across the solution portfolio, and consistent execution to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth.

 

In commercial bookings, a growing Q4 expiry base, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, and increased commitment to our platform should drive healthy growth against a strong prior year comparable.

As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drives increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.

 

Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be down roughly 1 point year-over-year.

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q4 gross margin percentage will increase roughly 1 point driven by continued improvement across our cloud services partially offset by a revenue mix shift to Azure.

 

Capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services.

Next to segment guidance; in Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $16.65 billion and $16.9 billion.

 

In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5.

We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by a point or two on a constant currency basis.

 

In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline similar to last quarter.

In Office consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the high single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions.

 

For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high-20s driven by the strong job market and healthy engagement on the platform.

And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth similar to last quarter.

 

For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue between $21.1 billion and $21.35 billion.

Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which as a reminder can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.

 

We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 2 points on a constant currency basis with a bit more FX impact on U.S.

dollar growth than at the segment level.

 

Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in our consumption business.

And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base.

 

In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low-to-mid single digits as demand for our hybrid offerings will be more than offset by the strong prior year comparable, which included 4 points of benefit from contracts with higher in period revenue recognition, as well as continued transactional weakness from the licensing program transition noted earlier.

And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits.

 

In more Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $14.65 billion and $14.95 billion.

As mentioned earlier, our guidance reflects the current constraints from the shutdowns in China, which have negatively impacted Q4 supply for OEM, Surface and Xbox consoles.

 

In Windows OEM we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid-single digits driven by the continued shift to a commercial-led PC market where revenue per license is higher.

In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the low-double digits.

 

In Surface, revenue should grow in low-double digits.

In Search and news advertising ex-TAC, we expect revenue growth of approximately 20%.

 

And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-to-high single digits driven by lower engagement hour’s year-over-year as well as constrained console supply.

We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline mid-single digits though engagement hours are expected to remain higher than pre-pandemic levels.

 

Now back to company guidance.

We expect COGS of $16.6 billion to $16.8 billion and operating expense of $14.8 billion to $14.9 billion resulting in another quarter of operating margin expansion excluding the change in useful life.

 

We expect other income and expense to be negative $50 million reflecting FX remeasurement impact based on market conditions in April.

Similar to the rest of our guidance, further equity and FX movements through Q4 are not reflected in this number.

 

As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility.

And we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.

 

We expect to close FY22, even in a more complex macro environment, with the same consistency we have delivered throughout the year.

With strong revenue growth, share gains, and improved operating margins as we invest in the areas that are key to sustaining that growth.

 

As we look toward FY23, our track record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets gives us confidence that we will drive continued healthy double-digit revenue and operating income growth.

Now, Brett lets go to Q&A.

 



Brett Iversen

Thanks Amy.

 

We will now move over to Q&A.

Out of respect for others on the call we request the partisans please only ask one question.

 

Jesse, can you please repeat your instructions.
Operator

Absolutely.

 

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.

Please proceed with your question.

 



Keith Weiss

Excellent.

 

Thank you guys so much for taking the question, and really impressive results.

And what we see is a pretty difficult climate out there.

 

Definitely from the stock market perspective, but if we think about interest rates, we think about inflation, there’s a, a conflict going on in Europe right now.

It does seem to be a tough backdrop.

 

You guys are operating super well.

I mean, the acceleration in Azure at that scale is truly awesome.

 

And so if I’m not mistaken Office 365 commercial accelerated as well in the quarter, so really impressive results.

But I think the question that most investors are going to have is where do you garner the confidence and the durability of this growth given how volatile this macro backdrop is?

 

Is it conversations you are having with customers?

Is it what you see in the backlog?

 

Maybe if you could give us some kind of insight into what gives you guys the confidence to put out that guide, to put out those healthy comments for FY23, what are you seeing that could maybe help us give us and give investors a little bit more confidence in the durability of this growth in this environment?



Satya Nadella

Yes, maybe I’ll start.

 

Maybe at three levels Keith, one is just the competitiveness of our tech stack all up sort of from infrastructure all the way to the SaaS applications when it comes to the commercial cloud and as well as how we are able to monetize for example, the install base of our consumer franchises as well.

So both of these places we feel we are competitive and increasingly so coming out of the pandemic to gain share.

 

I’d also say that in many of these places, we have price leadership.

I mean, take the one point I made which is, if there is any macro-headwind where you have more value for less price means you win.

 

And in our case, when it comes to our commercial cloud offerings we have significant advantages on that across the stack.

The second thing is in the conversations we are having with our customers.

 

The interesting thing I find from perhaps even past challenges whether macro or micro is no, I don’t hear of businesses looking to their IT budgets or digital transformation projects is the place for cuts, if anything, some of these projects are the way they’re going to accelerate their transformation or for that matter automation for example.

I have not seen this level of demand for automation technology to improve productivity because in an inflationary environment, the only deflationary force is software.

 

So that’s the second micro thing the tone thing that’s different.

At the end of the day though, I mean, none of us here are trying to forecast macro.

 

So all we think of is the TAMs that we are competing in a large, as a percentage of GDP tech spend is on a secular basis by the end of the decade going to double.

We just want to keep driving usage, driving share and be competitive, so that’s kind of how we view what we are doing.

 

And that’s where our confidence comes from in terms of our outlays, whether it’s OpEx or CapEx.

So I don’t know if Amy, if you want to add to that.

 



Amy Hood

I think the only thing Satya, I might add is, I think we’ve always and I think we’ve used this language quite frequently focused on the long–term opportunity.

 

You talked about it as the TAM that we’re focused on.

I would say also, there’s still a lot of that TAM left to go – left to go after and it is quite early, still.

 

And the transitions you’re talking about from a digital transformation perspective, from an automation perspective, from a type of value and real productivity enhancements that can be made.

And so I think the continuity of the execution has certainly been very good from the sales and partner side.

 

But I would also say to your point, we’re investing for a long-term opportunity and our confidence that that long-term outcome is right is where the – is I think the basis for where you and I are talking, giving this answer from.



Keith Weiss

Outstanding.

 

Great quarter.



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Keith, Jesse, next question please.

 
Operator

Absolutely.

 

Our next question is coming from Brent Thill with Jefferies.

Please proceed with your questions.

 



Brent Thill

Thanks.

 

Amy on your guidance, are you changing any of your close rate considerations or adding more supply chain constraints into that or is this the same guidance methodology that you you’ve been giving us in the past?



Amy Hood

I assume we’re specifically talking about most of the guidance in the more personal computing segment where the supply chain constraints, which are specifically related to the production shutdowns in China.

 

I generally follow the same principle I try to follow, which is I give you my best knowledge as of today.

I did note and tried to do that with a lot of clarity that were the production shutdowns to extend into May, there would be further negative impact on those from a supply constraint position.

 

As you know, on the OEM business, that revenue is recognized at the point of production and then for Xbox consoles as well as Surface it’s a sell-in.

So production delays even earlier in May can obviously have big impact on the quarter.

 

So we’re watching it and I’ve tried to make that transparent in the guidance, outside of that my guidance is reasonably consistent with how I – with how I like to do it.



Brent Thill

Great.

 

Thanks.



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Brent.

 

Jesse, next question please.
Operator

Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.

 

Please proceed with your questions.



Mark Moerdler

Thank you very much.

 

Congratulations on the quarter and on the strong guidance, I think it’s going to not just help the stock, but hopefully help a little bit more across into the industry.

I’d like to look at Office which had strength probably more than people expected.

 

Where are we in the up-sell opportunity from E3 to E5?

And can you give us any sense of the sizing of how much of the growth not just now, but going forward do you think is going to come from frontline users?

 

Thank you.



Amy Hood

Maybe I’ll start answering that question and Satya if you want to add, add anything.

 

Very specifically Mark, I would say, this quarter was quite similar in nature to what you saw in the past few.

Seat growth while across all segments was especially good in frontline worker and SMB.

 

That did mask a little bit as it often does the ARPU improvement, given those tend to be lower priced SKUs, the ARPU improvement that we’re seeing from the transitions into E5.

The transition from E3 to E5 still has opportunity.

 

I would say, we’re in the earlier transitions of that show in terms as, I think, about going forward there is certainly still room for both seat growth specifically and frontline worker, as you noted as well as SMB.

And then ARPU expansion through the E5 transition.

 

The thing I would add that Satya mentioned in his comments and again in his first answer is really the value that is available to customers in E5, whether that is security, whether it’s compliance, whether it’s phone, whether it’s analytics, the value of that suite, and if you think even more broadly, the value of Microsoft 365, which adds in more components around Windows.

I think we are offering high value and that tends to give us some optimism that we can continue to execute well in that segment.

 

I don’t know Satya if there is anything you would add to that.



Satya Nadella

No, you counted well, Amy.

 

I mean, I think, the fundamentals are pretty strong here still, whether it’s E5 growth, SMB growth, frontline worker, I’d also add emerging markets.

I mean, this is the first time I feel that we have products that fit just emerging markets like Teams Essentials, where we can even really penetrate markets that we’ve never sold anything in the past.

 

And then the new growth engines that you talked about, Teams Phones, Teams Rooms, Viva and even Windows 365 are all things that we can again, drive growth from.

And the point about sort of our value is probably a very, very strong in a time like this in particular.

 

And we see it like the one thing also I’d say is the usage data that we are seeing is peak everywhere.

And so that’s the other thing, is we definitely will optimize for driving usage and deployment and that’s going to be our priority.

 



Mark Moerdler

Thank you very much.

 

I really appreciate it.

Congrats.

 



Brett Iversen

Thanks Mark.

 

Jesse, next question, please.
Operator

Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead with UBS.

 

Please proceed with your question.



Karl Keirstead

Okay, great.

 

Amy, you called out some transactional weakness, which in the March quarter we can see in the on-prem Office segment and in your guidance in the server products, you suggest we might see it there too.

Is that something that you would characterize as Microsoft specific, as you describe in your comments, your transitioning customers off your Open License program?

 

Or do you feel like that’s a broader issue where maybe we’re starting to see a little bit of a tilt from on-prem to cloud even faster than we’ve seen before?

Thank you.

 



Amy Hood

Thanks, Karl.

 

That’s a very good question.

I would say it does not feel like the tilt from on-prem to cloud felt any different in a way that would have impacted the quarter anymore, so than it normally does in terms of the normal transitions.

 

We’ve seen to your point on Office or frankly, even in server, as we have people move those workloads and migrate those workloads to the cloud.

This really was very significant.

 

Think of it as a where partners transact.

And we have such a broad, and valuable, and really needed partner community that is very vast.

 

And we put this and had planned for this change for January 1.

And we executed the change on January 1 as plan, and it’s just taking us a little longer to onboard all of this community to make sure that they can transact the way they want to in the program.

 

So, I do think it’s going to take us longer than we thought, we’re going to continue to see that impact in Q4.

And I know the teams are working hard to make sure that partners get comfortable with the new system, which is important to us.

 



Karl Keirstead

Got it.

 



Satya Nadella

And the only thing I’d add is that this change is super good for both the partners, the customers and Microsoft long-term.

 



Amy Hood

Absolutely.

 



Satya Nadella

So, there is execution ahead, but we want to do this because it benefits everybody.

 



Karl Keirstead

Got it.

 

Thanks Satya.



Brett Iversen

Thanks Karl.

 

Jesse, next question, please.
Operator

Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.

 

Please proceed with your question.



Mark Murphy

Yes.

 

Thank you very much.

Satya handful of infrastructure software companies have commented that their consumption activity actually started to slow a few months ago.

 

And so, I’m curious what in your view is allowing your Azure trajectory to show better resilience.

And do you in fact, see some of the newer products kicking in such as Azure or Synapse Cognitive Services, OpenAI and perhaps contributing to the strength and health and resiliency of that Azure number?

 



Satya Nadella

Yes, I mean, what I’d say Karl [ph] is that what we are seeing is a classic what happens with consumption meters, right, which is they grow, and then they get optimized and they grow again both existing and new.

 

And so, it’s sort of, will always have some amount of volatility that even Amy referenced quarter-over-quarter.

But if I walk up, one thing that we look at is growth coming from all segments, right?

 

So small business and enterprise, is it coming from all regions?

And it is.

 

We also look at the type of workloads it’s coming from.

And so it looks healthy in all of those.

 

And if you walk up the stack to your point on the infrastructure side, the Tier 1 workloads is where I think we are seeing some big Tier 1 workloads, and I had many comments on SAP and other workloads moving.

The second thing I’d say is on the past services and our DevFest that’s another area where we have differentiated value.

 

So we see good growth there.

Data and AI for sure, I mean, the thing that I find really to be something that I think the long run is going to probably be one of the bigger drivers of our growth and differentiation is our data fabric, because we are the only guys who have a complete data fabric from the operational store that’s fully integrated into an analytics engine that’s fully integrated into governance.

 

And that increasingly is going to become more and more important, right?

I mean you can be dealing with this a new regulation coming on privacy and governance on one end and your operational store being divorced from that.

 

So we have a very differentiated offer and I talked about some of the growth numbers there.

The AI inference is also finally kicking.

 

They’re very small today, but even when I look at the total com – that’s just essentially a compute meter, there’s growth there.

So overall, I think we will see quarter-over-quarter, some cyclicality, depending on which customers.

 

In fact, we pay people at Microsoft to reduce customer bills and which we should.

So given that we may see cyclicality in terms of how optimizations happen, but overall we’re still very early on as the world sort of migrates to the cloud and users, essentially cloud infrastructure and compute is sort of to drive their operational efficiencies and product.

 



Mark Murphy

Thank you.

 



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Mark.

 

Jesse, next question, please.
Operator

Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.

 

Please proceed with your question.



Kash Rangan

Thank you so much.

 

Congrats on a spectacular quarter.

Satya, I have very clearly on your comments and particularly you talked about tech as a percentage of GDP doubling over the next seven, eight years or so.

 

Nobody could have really predicted maybe besides yourself, that Azure would be this big and growing this fast at this point in time relative to say five, six years back.

So as you look forward, what part of the Microsoft tech stack do you think is underrepresented in the digital word and has therefore more opportunity to gain as you build out your thesis on tech as a percentage of GDP doubling.

 

Thank you so much.



Satya Nadella

I mean the thing that I always go back Kash is that all enterprise value at least as far as I can tell, gets created at three layers of the tech stack.

 

What happens with infrastructure, whenever something can be 10x better.

So for example, when we talk about the next generation of multi-edge, multi-cloud, infrastructure remaining one of the leaders, that’s going to be a massive EV creation as a percentage of GDP tech spend double.

 

So that’s where everything from Azure, Azure, our database, our – all of that’s super important.

The other one is, this is sort of age of AI.

 

In other words, the core business logic is not being written.

It’s being written by software.

 

So when I look at, when I use get up co-pilot, that’s the therein lies the future of what how all business logic gets written.

And so to me the AI layer, both the training, supercomputers, as well as the inference layer that’s a place where you’ll see us integrate what today you all consider to be two different businesses, whether it’s Azure and Windows, they’re just one business to me, because to me, where in training happens, where inference happens will be written once by developers.

 

And then it’ll light up across this distributed fabric.

So that’s another place where I think there’s tons of enterprise value that’ll get created over time.

 

And then of course the UI layer always is the biggest one.

And the next inflection point, whether it’s what happens with MetaWare, so what happens with even on the industrial side with IoT and digital twins those are all things that I think will be the ones that we will be focused on.

 

So these three things translated into workloads and what we call our customer solution areas are the ways that at least we are investing in.



Kash Rangan

Fascinating.

 

Thank you so much.



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Kash.

 

Jesse, next question, please.
Operator

Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.

 

Please proceed with your question.



Michael Turrin

Hey, there, good afternoon.

 

Thank you for taking the question and great job with the results.

Azure growth and commercial booking strengths stand out.

 

You mentioned a step down expected in Azure growth in Q4, but still suggest very impressive growth at that scale.

Can you expand on the large deal commentary the longer-term strategic deals you’ve referenced a few times over the past couple of quarters, how those impact visibility or maybe the approach to framing targets there?

 

And anything you can add just around how the addition of Nuance helps the cloud business and the industry cloud approach as well is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

 



Amy Hood

Satya, do you want to start with your comments maybe on Nuance overall, and then – and I can address sort of how the larger long-term contracts.

 



Satya Nadella

Yes.

 

Sure.

Just a couple of quick things.

 

One is on the strategic commitments that are being made.

We are sort of working at them workload at a time, and so we feel very, very good about both the type of workloads.

 

In fact, I – there is a migration of a bunch of workloads that we may have won in the client server that are migrating, but the most exciting thing is the type of Tier 1 workloads that we have never seen run on any Microsoft infrastructure that’s running on Azure today and being optimized on Azure.

So that’s the thing that we see as we win these large strategic deals.

 

On Nuance, for me, the thing that’s exciting is Nuance is a platform layer for these AI driven applications that are getting deployed, whether it’s in healthcare or even in the enterprise contact center.

So we are very excited about Nuance now being part of the Microsoft family.

 

You’ll see us pretty aggressively go innovate there and grow the impact of these solutions in both what is sort of the large percentages of our GDP, like healthcare where I think things like tackling issues like physician burdens with new innovative solutions is much needed and we are really looking forward to exercising that.



Amy Hood

And Michael, maybe specifically you’re absolutely right.

 

I tend to mention the impact of large long-term Azure contract, both in the context of commercial bookings and some volatility we often can see in that because of it.

But really, I think the way we think about them maybe outside of this phone call, is that it’s the beginning of the commitment between us and a customer to start to work together to deliver value.

 

And so we go workload by workload, opportunity by opportunity and I think that’s what you were inferring a bit is that it’s almost the top of the funnel to create value for the customer.

We call it delivering success to make sure they’re spending the dollars the most effective way, making sure we’re tackling the hardest problems that they need solved.

 

And with that comes our investments that we’ve made and deployment resources and usage resources specifically in Azure to make that possible with customers.

And so you’re right to say, I do talk about them in terms of volatility they create, what it creates inside the company is the beginning of a commitment to make sure we’re tackling the workloads and the solutions that the customers want to make happen across all the workloads frankly that Satya has talked about today.

 



Michael Turrin

The great complimentary points also highlight.

 

Thanks very much.



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Michael.

 

Jesse, we have time for one last question.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our final question will come from Keith Bachman with BMO.

Please proceed with your question.

 



Keith Bachman

Hi, and many thanks.

 

I wanted to break it up into two parts.

But I was wondering if you could comment on what you see is the strength of the PC market as you look out over the course of the calendar year, if you focus on the demand side equation, not the supply side of the equation.

 

And really the more important related part is given the outlook that you may have for the PC market.

How are you thinking about the durability of the Windows side of your business?

 

In particular, if you comment on the fundamentals related PC market, but also the opportunities to keep mixing up, so to speak helped by Microsoft 365.

Many thanks.

 



Satya Nadella

So let me…

 



Amy Hood

Why don’t you start and I’ll add on.

 



Satya Nadella

Perfect.

 

So I think on the commercial side, I think it’s well understood is that Windows is the socket for Microsoft 365.

We have tremendous value, Amy referenced this earlier.

 

In fact, we just launched Windows 11 and pro value with Windows 365, that’s resonating super well.

The customer sat adoption rates when it comes, whether it’s security, whether it’s our productivity, we feel good about the commercial business.

 

So we’ll stay focused on it on the commercial side.

And on the consumer side, the coming out again the pandemic, the intensity of the usage has gone up.

 

So one of the areas of focus for us is some of the stuff that I talked about in my remarks is just the usage, right?

So where – when you think about 500 million users engaging with Microsoft start, that’s not the type of engagement we had.

 

And so with a large installed base now, we have a significant room there, the browser share growth, we have significant room there.

And then, of course, the subscription attaches whether it’s gaming or whether it’s productivity or suites.

 

So that’s kind of how I look at what we are going to do at least in the immediate future.

PC remains a very important category and I think people’s lives is what we’ve discovered during the pandemic.

 

And if anything, the intensity of usage is increased.

And there will be cyclical demand that we’ll go through.

 

But the number of use cases is definitely, I think, structurally increased.



Amy Hood

Exactly.

 

I think the one thing I would add on your demand side, we have seen the transition from, I would say, in the middle of pandemic, definitely a consumer driven demand cycle.

We’ve transitioned that to be a commercial part of the demand side.

 

And so I do expect that to be the case, obviously, I think this is the second quarter in the row.

We’ve seen that transition expect Q4 to be even more of that.

 

And then we’ll wait and see how the second half of the year shapes up.



Keith Bachman

Okay.

 

Many thanks.

Congratulations.

 



Amy Hood

Thank you.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.

 

Today's call is being recorded.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr.

 

Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer.

Please go ahead, sir.

 



Christopher Stevo

Good morning.

 

Welcome to Pfizer's third quarter earnings call.

We anticipate that this call will last 60 minutes.

 

I'm joined today by Dr.

Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Dave Denton, our CFO; and Dr.

 

Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical.

Joining for the Q&A session, we will also have Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer and President, Global Biopharmaceuticals Business; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business Innovation Officer; Dr.

 

William Pao, our Chief Development Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.

Before we begin the call, I'm also happy to announce that we will host an Analyst Day in New York City on the afternoon of December 12.

 

Members of our executive team and other leaders of Pfizer will share information on our rich slate of potential near-term product launches and the R&D readouts which will drive the next wave of product launches after that, both of which will support our 2030 revenues and beyond.

In-person attendance will be by invitation, but we will also be webcasting the event.

 

While we're not going to talk more about the agenda today, we look forward to providing more details as we get closer to December 12.

Materials for this call and other earnings-related materials are on the Investor Relations section of pfizer.com.

With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Chris.

 

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.

I will briefly touch on some recent highlights.

 

I will then spend the bulk of my time speaking to our expectations for what we feel will be a promising and prosperous future for Pfizer and the patients we serve.

In addition to generating a stellar financial performance, since our last earnings call, we reported positive pivotal data for several exciting pipeline programs, including our RSV vaccine candidate for older adults, Prevnar 20 for children, the potential combination of treatment of TALZENNA and XTANDI in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, our pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate for adolescents and young adults, as well as exciting progress for our GLP-1 program in type 2 diabetes and obesity.

 

Just this morning, we announced positive top line data from the Phase III clinical trial investigating our bivalent RSV vaccine candidate when administered to pregnant participants to help protect their infants from RSV disease after birth.

We established a new commercial structure within our global biopharmaceutical business that is focused on 3 broad therapeutic areas: primary care, specialty care and oncology.

 

We believe this new structure will enable us to maximize the commercial success of the multiple exciting product launches, including several potential blockbusters that are poised to emerge from our scientific pipeline over the next few years.

We have continued to advance potentially game-changing vaccines in the fight against respiratory disease by entering into a Phase III study for our mRNA flu vaccine candidate and initiating a Phase I study for a vaccine candidate that combines our mRNA flu and COVID-19 vaccine in one shot.

 

We completed the acquisitions of Biohaven Pharmaceuticals and Global Blood Therapeutics, giving us market-leading franchises in both migraine and sickle cell disease, respectively.

Less than 6 months ago after launching An Accord for a Healthier World, a breakthrough initiative designed to close the health equity gap for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower-income countries, I'm proud to say that the first shipments of our products have arrived to these countries, and we are working with governments on health system improvements that can help make sure these products reach those in need.

 

And of course, we continue to lead the fight against COVID-19.

Most notably, our Omicron-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized by the U.S.

 

Food and Drug Administration, by the European Medicines Agency and several other regulatory bodies.

And as part of Pfizer's commitment to providing equitable access to COVID-19 oral treatments, we agreed to supply at a not-for-profit price up to 6 million PAXLOVID treatment courses to the Global Fund for low and lower middle income countries.

 

An exciting quarter, for sure.

But in our company and our industry, it's all about what's next.

 

The next breakthrough medicine or vaccine, the next game-changing, the next solution to an unmet patient need.

This continued pursuit of what's next is embedded in Pfizer's DNA and the foundational driver of our purpose: breakthroughs that change patients' lives.

 

It's also why we have confidence that Pfizer's story is a story of growth.

We recognize that some are questioning Pfizer's longer-term growth projects, particularly in the '25 to '30 time frame.

 

That's understandable given that we currently expect a negative impact of approximately $17 billion in revenues from losses of exclusivity during that period based on our internal calculations.

We believe we not only can overcome these expected declines, but also can potentially generate strong growth through the end of the decade.

 

Let's take a closer look on how we expect to accomplish this.

Our strong capital position has given us the ability to pursue business development opportunities with the potential, if successful, of course, to add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 top line expectations.

 

We believe the deals we have already done for Arena, Biohaven, Global Blood Therapeutics and ReViral have the potential to get us more than 1/3 of the way there and that we have more than enough capital to invest in the additional opportunities needed to meet or exceed this target.

Perhaps even more exciting is the wave of potential growth drivers emerging from our R&D pipeline in the near term.

 

Over the next 18 months, we expect to have up to 19 new products or indications in the market, including the 5 for which we have already begun co-promotions or commercialization earlier this year.

We can find -- you can find the list of these launches in the appendix of the presentation we posted today for this earnings call.

 

If successful, these 19 launches, of which more than 2/3 have the potential to be blockbusters, will be the most ever in Pfizer's history.

The 15 in-house-developed projects alone could potentially represent approximately $20 billion in 2030 sales, which would more than offset the expected LOE impact.

 

Many of these programs are already largely de-risked from a clinical perspective.

The majority of them were discovered in-house and nearly all of them would be for indications outside of COVID-19.

 

If approved, we expect each of these to be key contributors to our growth aspirations through 2025 and beyond.

And of course, we have many more potential vaccines and medicines in our pipeline with numerous launches expected in the '24 to '30 time line.

 

These include gene therapy candidates for hemophilia A, B and Duchenne muscular dystrophy; our oral GLP-1 for diabetes and obesity; a potential combo vaccine that would cover flu and COVID in one shot and many, many more.

With regard to our COVID-19 products, while their sales may fall from our expected 2022 levels of approximately combined $55 billion, we believe our COVID-19 franchises will remain multibillion-dollar revenue generators for the foreseeable future which should serve as a buffer for any unforeseen challenges with other products in our portfolio.

 

Our confidence to execute this plan stems from the depth of our financial resources and the firepower it gives us to pursue business development opportunities, the powerful brand equity we have built up over the past 170 years and further enhanced in the past 2 years.

According to a recent survey, our brand awareness now stands at an impressive 82% and our favorability stands at 61% compared with 42% for the industry as a whole, results that were obtained just a couple of months ago.

 

And of course, the strength of the 3 foundational pillars of our company, our world-class scientific, our world-class commercial and our world-class manufacturing engines, and you will see on this slide some highlights of each one of them.

Let me now briefly highlight 3 potential blockbusters that we expect to contribute to our long-term growth.

 

RSV is an area of significant unmet need, particularly in older adults and infants.

Each year, it is estimated more than 177,000 older adults are hospitalized and 14,000 of them die in the U.S.

 

alone due to RSV that is confirmed by a diagnostic test.

We believe we have the potential to be a leader in this space and have a real impact on public health.

 

On March 24 of this year, the FDA granted breakthrough designation for our RSV vaccine candidate for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in individuals 60 years of age or older.

We are excited to report positive top line data from the Phase III RENOIR trial in late August, with the recent presentation of detailed results at IDWeek 22.

 

A preplanned interim analysis showed vaccine efficacy of 67% against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness, defined by 2 or more symptoms.

And vaccine efficacy of 85.7% was observed in participants with more severe disease, presenting 3 or more RSV-associated symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness.

 

We are also excited about the potential for our maternal RSV vaccine candidate.

Globally, each year, RSV sickens more than 6.5 million infants under 6 months old and kills approximately 45,000.

 

As announced this morning, our maternal RSV study met the success criterion for 1 of the 2 primary endpoints.

Vaccine efficacy of 81.8% was observed against severe medically attended lower respiratory tract illness due to RSV in infants from birth through the first 90 days of life.

 

And high efficacy of 69.4% was demonstrated through the first 6 months of life.

So there is the potential that, subject to regulatory approval, by late 2023, early 2024, we could have the only RSV maternal vaccine in the market, along with an RSV vaccine for older adults, that has high efficacy, and it is well tolerated with no safety concerns.

 

Combined, the 2 indications represent a potential multibillion-dollar peak revenue opportunity if approved, especially with our highly respected primary care sales force executing these launches.

Including the RSV antiviral investigational candidates we acquired with ReViral, we aim to have end-to-end solutions with both preventative vaccines and therapeutics to treat those infected with RSV.

 

Ulcerative colitis or UC is a chronic and often debilitating inflammatory bowel disease that affects an estimated 1 million people in the U.S.

alone.

 

Many patients living with this disease never achieve or maintain remission, and physicians are seeking effective, proven oral therapies with a favorable benefit/risk profile that can be an attractive first-line advanced therapy option.

As a result, we expect the market opportunity to grow by about 50% over the next 5 years.

 

The positive Phase III data from the ELEVATE UC 12 and 52 trials reinforce our belief that etrasimod has a differentiated clinical profile and can be an important treatment option if approved.

We believe that etrasimod can be a multibillion-dollar blockbuster product.

 

We expect to launch the product in the U.S.

as soon as the second half of 2023, pending regulatory approval, through our specialty care sales force, which already has strong relationships in the UC market, thanks to its work with Xeljanz, biosimilars, et cetera.

 

Lastly, let's look at migraine.

Following our acquisition of Biohaven in early October, we are now aiming to build the world's leading global migraine franchise with the potential to impact 1 billion patients around the world.

 

Migraine is a debilitating disease and has 11.6% prevalence worldwide.

In the U.S.

 

alone, there are 40 million patients with migraine, and 1 out of 5 women are migraine sufferers right now.

The economic burden is significant at $36 billion per year.

 

We believe our portfolio, including NURTEC ODT, VYDURA and zavegepant, could meet a range of needs in the market, allowing physicians and patients to decide how to appropriately manage migraine treatment and prevention.

As a result, we see the potential to reach more than $6 billion in peak revenues altogether.

 

In the U.S., NURTEC is growing very well, including the impact of Pfizer's co-promoting, which began in August pre-close.

NURTEC has further strengthened its #1 market share position in the oral CGRP market, and we expect even stronger growth as we deliver on our promise to further enhance our commercial efforts behind this program.

 

Outside the U.S., it has been approved in the EU, U.K., Israel, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and we have filed for registration in an additional 10 markets.

While this is not a new product launch, we believe this is a great example of how we can take this portfolio to new heights by leveraging the full strength of Pfizer's global commercial engine, including in primary care physicians.

 

Moving over to zavegepant.

We recently expect to launch zavegepant intranasal in the U.S.

 

next year, pending FDA approval, and we plan to globally commercialize.

Lastly, the oral prevention Phase III trial is ongoing with a data readout expected in the third quarter.

 

So with that, I turn it over to Dave to update you on the results and outlook for the financials.

After Dave, Mikael will speak about the progression of our pipeline.

 



David Denton

Thank you, Albert, and good morning.

 

I'll begin this morning with a few comments regarding how the company continues to deploy capital in a disciplined manner in support of long-term growth and, importantly, enhanced shareholder returns.

As you know, Pfizer's cash generation capabilities has expanded significantly over the past several years and the efficient deployment of this capital is more critical than ever.

 

During the first 9 months of 2022, the company has deployed and committed capital in 3 main areas: first, we've invested $7.8 billion in internal R&D as we continue to support our growing pipeline of innovative medicines.

These investments are squarely focused on driving revenue growth through 2030.

 

Secondly, in the first 3 quarters of this year, we have invested approximately $8 billion in completed business transactions.

Additionally, early in the fourth quarter, the company completed investments of more than $18 billion in transactions, including both Biohaven and GBT, which brings us to approximately $26 billion in capital deployed for business development transactions thus far in 2022 alone.

 

These transactions illustrate our progress towards the goal of adding $25 billion in risk-adjusted 2030 revenues through BD.

And finally, we have returned nearly $9 billion of capital to shareholders through a combination of both dividends and value-enhancing share repurchases.

 

Clearly, maximizing shareholder value through prudent capital allocation will continue to be a major focus for Pfizer.

So with that, let me briefly review our financial results for the quarter.

 

I'll limit my remarks largely to adjusted and operating growth figures.

Third quarter revenues demonstrated strength across many areas of the business, but much of that strength was somewhat obscured by our incredibly strong performance in the third quarter of 2021.

 

Given the strength in the prior year, revenues this quarter decreased 2% operationally.

However, looking at it on a 2-year basis, revenues this quarter were up more than 120% compared to the third quarter of 2020.

 

The slight decrease compared to last year was in line with our expectations given the phasing of scheduled deliveries of COMIRNATY, which we discussed in our earnings call last quarter.

Also underlying our results this quarter was the strong performance of PAXLOVID as well as continued strength from a number of our other key products.

 

Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues related to the COVID products, Pfizer's revenues grew 2% operationally in the quarter.

Gross margins expanded by 1,450 basis points versus the third quarter of LY.

 

This improvement is largely due to increased sales of higher-margin PAXLOVID and decreased sales of lower-gross margin COMIRNATY compared to last year.

These improvements were partially offset by the impact of a $400 million charge related to excess raw materials for PAXLOVID.

 

Given the unpredictable nature of the virus, we intentionally chose to order additional stock to ensure we can meet any global health demand if an extreme need were to arise.

Adjusted SI&A expenses in the third quarter grew 23% operationally.

 

The increase was primarily driven by spending for PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY and higher health care reform fees.

The 2% operational increase in adjusted R&D expense in Q3 was primarily driven by increased cost to develop recently acquired assets as well as investments for certain oncology and non-COVID-19 vaccines programs.

 

This was partially offset by lower spending on programs to prevent and treat COVID-19 and various late-stage clinical programs.

The effective tax rate on adjusted income in the quarter was 4.4%, significantly lower than typical, driven by tax benefits related to global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions spanning several tax years.

 

Excluding these tax resolutions, the underlying tax rate was consistent with historical trends.

As a result, reported diluted earnings per share of $1.51 grew by 6%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.78 grew 44% on an operational basis in the quarter.

 

Now foreign exchange movements continue to dampen our results, negatively impacting revenues by approximately $950 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.05 this quarter.

Now let me move to our updated 2022 guidance.

 

Given our strong third quarter performance and our improving outlook for the year, we are increasing our operational expectations for revenues by $1.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.19.

This operational increase on the bottom line would have been even higher if not for an incremental $0.06 negative impact due to higher acquired IPR&D expenses.

 

Partially offsetting these operational increases is the impact of additional strengthening of the U.S.

dollar since we last updated guidance in late July.

 

Incremental foreign exchange movements negatively impacted our expectations for 2022 revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $700 million and $0.09, respectively.

The net impact of these cross-currents result in increases to the midpoints of our revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance ranges.

 

These revised ranges reflect operational growth rates of 31% for revenues and 70% for adjusted diluted earnings per share at the midpoint compared to 2021.

And this was up from our previous operational growth expectations for revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share of 29% and 65%, respectively.

 

Regarding our COVID-19-related revenues, we now expect the vaccine revenue for the year to be approximately $34 billion, up by $2 billion compared to our prior guidance.

For PAXLOVID, we expect sales of approximately $22 billion, keeping the guidance range unchanged despite the negative incremental impact of changes in FX.

 

You can see on this slide our updated costs and expense guidance which incorporates our performance to date, our recent acquisitions and our updated expectations for the remainder of the year.

More information on each of these updates can be found in this morning's press release.

 

2022 guidance once again assumes no incremental share repurchases beyond the $2 billion of share repurchases we completed in March of 2022.

In closing, it's an exciting time in the history of Pfizer.

 

We believe that our strong financial performance in the quarter and our improving operational outlook for the year sets the stage for long-term shareholder value creation.

With that, I'll now turn it over to Mikael.

 



Mikael Dolsten

Thank you, Dave.

 

Today, I will focus attention on high-value programs that will potentially deliver breakthroughs in areas of high unmet need and are expected to be key contributors to our growth aspirations through 2025 and beyond.

With anchor products such as COMIRNATY, PAXLOVID, IBRANCE and XTANDI, we are building out comprehensive franchises in several areas, including respiratory, metabolic disorders, genetic hematology and certain cancers.

 

We have deep expertise in these areas, and there is exciting science emerging.

I will share updates from 3 of these today: respiratory, metabolic and prostate cancer.

 

Building on our success with COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID, we see enormous potential to help address major causes of respiratory disease through vaccines and therapeutics.

Work on the next-generation vaccine candidates are well underway.

 

And last week, we started a Phase I clinical trial of our second-generation oral therapeutic candidate.

Our quadrivalent modRNA flu program has progressed into Phase III, and we will start shortly a Phase I study of an mRNA-based vaccine candidate that combines our quadrivalent modRNA flu vaccine candidate with the Omicron-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine based on BA.4/5.

 

In RSV, we believe a dual focus on developing a vaccine and antivirals could make a significant impact globally.

I will share new data with you shortly.

 

PAXLOVID continues to be an important tool in helping to combat the impact of COVID-19.

And secondary endpoints from the EPIC-High Risk study as well as data from real-world evidence support the product's efficacy profile.

 

In the EPIC-HR study, PAXLOVID reduced COVID-19-related all-cause deaths and ICU admissions by 100% and COVID-19-related hospitalization by 86% in unvaccinated, high-risk patients compared to placebo.

It also reduced the duration of COVID-19 symptoms by 2 to 3 days compared to placebo.

 

We are pleased to see PAXLOVID leading the COVID-19 treatment landscape and remain confident in its safety and efficacy in treating patients at high-risk for severe outcomes.

We recently reported a positive interim analysis from a Phase III study in older adults of our novel RSV vaccine candidate, which targets the prefusion F protein on both RSV A and B, without need for an adjuvant.

 

We saw remarkable vaccine efficacy across the first RSV season.

The vaccine was extremely well tolerated with favorable systemic tolerability, a key consideration for vaccines.

 

We also are developing the RSVpreF vaccine candidate for use in pregnant women so that protection may be conferred to newborns.

And this morning, we announced exciting results from a preplanned interim analysis of our Phase III trial.

 

We observed vaccine efficacy of nearly 82% against severe medically attended lower respiratory tract illness or MA-LRTI due to RSV in infants from birth through the first 90 days of life and efficacy of more than 69% through the first 6 months of life.

Success criterion was not met for the second primary endpoint.

 

However, clinically meaningful efficacy was observed with MA-LRTI of 57% in infant from birth through 90 days of life and efficacy of 51% over the 6-month follow-up period.

The Data Monitoring Committee indicated the vaccine was well tolerated with no safety concerns for either vaccinated women or their newborns.

 

Given these impressive results, we look forward to filing BLA for both older adults and pregnant women with the U.S.

FDA by year-end with potential launches in '23.

 

If approved, our maternal RSV vaccine candidate potentially would be the first available to help prevent this common and potentially life-threatening respiratory illness in young infants.

Turning now to prostate cancer.

 

We're building upon the standard of care set by XTANDI in castration-sensitive and castration-resistant population.

The Phase III EMBARK study of XTANDI in non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer is expected to read out first half of '23.

 

And the Phase III TALAPRO-3 study of TALZENNA and XTANDI is expected in '24.

These trials may indicate benefit in up to 20% more patients than are currently treated and potentially prolong duration of use, subject to clinical success and regulatory approval.

 

Now in TALAPRO-2, we observed the first clinical benefit of a PARP inhibitor plus XTANDI in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with or without homologous recombination repair or HRR gene mutation.

Irrespective of HRR gene mutation status, the study achieved its primary endpoint.

 

The combination delivered a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in radiographic progression-free survival and appears to have resulted in the longest observed such survival in a randomized trial in this setting.

We are encouraged by these results and believe that TALZENNA in prostate cancer may have blockbuster potential, subject to regulatory approval.

 

Turning to metabolic disorders.

I previously shared that we are developing 2 oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, danuglipron and 1532.

 

Recently presented Phase Ib data for 1532 show dose-dependent reduction from baseline at 4 to 6 weeks in mean daily glucose, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c and body weight.

Both candidates are potentially best-in-class and differentiated by offering full agonism, which may be required to achieve the same level of response as injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists while offering a convenient once daily dose for 1532.

 

Glucose effects plateau at lower doses, while body weight effects continue to improve at higher doses.

The planned Phase IIb study will evaluate 1532 versus both oral semaglutide and placebo in type 2 diabetes and separately versus placebo in obesity.

 

Using semaglutide as a comparator in the type 2 diabetes arm should allow us to observe potential early signs of differentiation in efficacy, tolerability and safety.

We will evaluate doses up to 260 milligrams in this study, higher than the studies in the Phase Ib.

 

We plan to begin dosing soon and anticipate the readout in first quarter 2024.

The ongoing Phase IIb study of danuglipron in obesity with now once-monthly titration is expected to complete second half of 2023.

 

Data from these studies will be available in relatively quick succession and, assuming clinical success, allow us to select one based on efficacy, tolerability and dosing to advance to Phase III in both type 2 diabetes and obesity.

In closing, we are excited about the developing science within these franchisees and share here recent and anticipated milestones in the next 18 months.

 

We look forward to continue our development both for potential patient benefit and sustainable growth.

Thank you.

 

Let me turn over to Chris to start Q&A.



Christopher Stevo

Thanks, Mikael.

 

With that, let's start the Q&A session.

We have about 30 minutes for this session.

 

We will answer as many questions as time permits.

And Investor Relations will be available after the call to answer any follow-up questions.

 

Chelsea, please go ahead and queue up the first question.
Operator

[Operator Instructions].

 

Our first question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.

We'll go to our next question, Colin Bristow with UBS.

 



Colin Bristow

On COVID '23 expectations, should we expect anything from you here on the December 12 Investor event?

 

And then just more broadly around this, how are you thinking conceptually about guiding to this?

Will it be similar to last year?

 

Are you thinking of more sort of scenario-based guiding?

Anything that would be helpful.

 

And then just a sort of temperature check on business development, if you could update us on your priorities and interests.

And then from a deal perspective, just how big would you be willing to go?

 

Thank you.



Albert Bourla

Thank you.

 

On the December 12, what you should expect, it is a good overview of our very important new product launches in the coming 18 months, with more details about the science and the market potential of those launches as well as some of the most important pipeline potential new medicines and vaccines that they are not going to be launched in the next 18 months but will be launched in the period between '24 and '30.

Now for the BD priorities, I would ask Aamir to reiterate once more our strategy when it comes to BD.

 



Aamir Malik

Thanks for the question, Colin.

 

The BD priorities remain consistent with what we've articulated before.

And principally, we are most excited about scientific substrate that has the potential for patient breakthroughs.

 

That's going to continue to be our north star.

We're looking for deals that accelerate our top line growth in the back half of the decade.

 

And importantly, we're focused on opportunities where we can add substantial value, and that can come in the form of either shaping the science or also accelerating our commercial momentum.

And if you look at the deals that we announced and closed in 2022, including Arena, Biohaven, ReViral and GBT, they would all be very consistent with those priorities.

 

We've said that we are agnostic to size of transaction.

But you've also heard us be very clear about the fact that cost synergy-driven deals is not where our focus is going to be.

 

We're going to be focused on driving growth through our BD.



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Aamir.

 

And also, Dave, maybe you can also address the question about guidance on COVID and are we going to provide it and when for '23, et cetera.



David Denton

Yes.

 

Thank you, Albert.

Maybe let me discuss the stage as it relates to COVID and the COVID franchise.

 

I think if you look out longer-term, the franchise is going to be a multibillion-dollar franchise in the respect that this is going to be somewhat like a flu, sustained flu, but actually more deadly than the flu.

So therefore, I think the products, both from a vaccine and the therapy perspective that Pfizer has developed, are going to be quite relevant for many years to come.

 

Having said that, when we provide guidance for 2023, when it's appropriate to do so, we will give investors a perspective on what our expectations are for the year.

We will break out that guidance specifically, so you can hold us accountable for delivering on those revenue promises when the time comes.

 
Operator

Next, we have Louise Chen with Cantor.

 



Louise Chen

So I wanted to ask you, first off, how you think about -- or maybe more color on how you think about the pushes and pulls in 2023.

 

There's a lot of moving parts there.

And then secondly, on your RSV franchise, there seems to be several players with drugs in development and they've all reported out positive data.

 

So curious how you think about this market playing out over time?



Albert Bourla

Yes.

 

Let me say a few words about the push and pulls, and then I will ask Angela to complement and then speak about how we see the RSV market.

Clearly, '23 is a very, very important year for us given the unprecedented number of new launches that we are going to have in the next 18 months.

 

And most of them will happen in '23 and some beginning of the first quarter of '24.

But we are launching products, not only a very big number of them, but only the internal ones, $20 billion, excluding the BD, Biohaven and the Global Blood, $20 billion of peak sales were expected 2030 sales we are expecting from those launches.

 

So it's a very, very big number.

And it's very important for us to do it well.

 

In addition, so clearly, that will bring -- our non-COVID business will be a significant boost for our non-COVID business.

Now when we move to COVID, we expect '23 will be a transition year with likely in the U.S.

 

moving from a government model into a commercial model for vaccines and therapeutics.

The timing is not certain.

 

So we are ready to do it ASAP, but we will be phased over the years.

And it likely will not be the same for PAXLOVID or COMIRNATY.

 

And clearly also, there will be some stuff that will have to be depleted in '23.

And clearly, will be new price dynamics as we are moving to '23.

 

So COVID will be a little bit more of a transitional year in '23 until it will be established into more like a flu volumes type of market.

But of course, with different price points and different severity of the disease, that will bring both therapeutic and vaccines into a multibillion-dollars franchise.

 

But we are not going to predict now what will be the number for the years out, but we will try to be as accurate as possible for our '23 numbers when we will provide guidance.

Now Angela, anything to add on the push and pulls?

 

You are carrying a lot of the weight for the new launches and also speak about one of them, which is going to be the RSV maternal and adult.



Angela Hwang

Well, we're extremely excited about both the adult vaccine as well as the maternal vaccine.

 

First and foremost, because it is in the sweet spot of what Pfizer does, respiratory vaccines, right?

We have a lot of experience of this created through the legacy of our pneumococcal franchise and the strength we have there, but also recently from COMIRNATY.

 

I'll also add that Pfizer is the only company that has both the adult vaccine as well as the maternal vaccine.

And it really does fit so extremely well into our existing commercial footprint.

 

These are large populations, both the adult as well as maternal.

Let me just start with adult and just sort of characterize that a bit.

 

There's 61 million 65-year-olds, all of whom are eligible for this vaccination.

It's actually a -- it's quite a devastating disease.

 

The hospital costs from RSV for adults is over $1.2 billion.

It is also underreported and underdiagnosed.

 

And so we have a really great opportunity here to drive awareness of this disease but also to use the commercial footprint that we already have to create awareness, to create education and to bring this vaccine to those who need it.

Equally, in the maternal space, a devastating disease.

 

Most of the mortality and the morbidity is in infants that are under 6 months old and those that are preterm.

And actually, over 102,000 deaths worldwide are resulting from infant infections of RSV.

 

So again, we see a tremendous opportunity to make a difference here.

As you know, through the work that we've done on Prevnar, we have a tremendous legacy in pediatric vaccines.

 

And so that, coupled with our strength in women's health and the commercial footprint we have there as well, is going to be perfectly suited for us to launch the maternal RSV vaccine.

And so bringing all of this together, I think that we have the scientific knowledge, we have the technology, we have the relationships with the vaccinators and the sites of vaccinations.

 

We are also very well versed in our work with the vaccine technical committees around the world, in bringing together a broad recommendation, which we believe is what's going to give us access to many, many infants as well as adults to these 2 tremendous breakthroughs.

So I think we have the best-in-class capabilities to do a great job with this respiratory portfolio.

 



Albert Bourla

Very well, Angela, and I agree with you.

 
Operator

Next, we have Steve Scala with Cowen.

 



Stephen Scala

I have three questions, but they're all short.

 

First, what impact on RSV-associated infant hospitalizations did Pfizer see in the Phase III MATISSE trial?

Second, can you tell us what NURTEC sales were in Q3?

 

I know you didn't own Biohaven in Q3, but you likely know the number.

And then lastly, all things considered, is it unrealistic to think that COMIRNATY plus PAXLOVID sales could be as much as $15 billion in 2030?

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you very much.

 

Mikael, what about the RSV data?



Mikael Dolsten

Thank you for the question.

 

So as you have seen in our press release, we reported out very impressive data and the 2 separate primary endpoints that were independent, it is sufficient to hit one for filing.

And to our privilege and encouragement, we hit strongly on the most important.

 

And that was defined as severe, medically attended lower tract respiratory infections, where we had close to 82% vaccine efficacy.

That is defined by clinical features, such as the rate and the stress of respiration, oxygenation levels, et cetera, in the children and will include patients, whether they are hospitalized or not.

 

We will later release data on secondary endpoints that include hospitalization.

When you look at this dramatic effect on the severe infections, it seems very reasonable to project that we will have a dramatic impact in lowering hospitalizations.

 

I'm probably talking about tens of thousands of hospitalizations in the U.S.

that may not happen if this vaccine is used to vaccinate maternal prior to delivering children as appropriately studied in this vaccination.

 

So we're very encouraged and optimistic about that type of value.



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Mikael.

 

Before I turn to Dave to answer the question about the sales of NURTEC in the third quarter, let me make a comment on COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID and the franchise.

Clearly, we said that we will provide us good picture of what we expect to be the sales for next year.

 

Now you're asking about year 2030, which is even more challenging.

But also, the way you are asking the question, is it unthinkable -- is it unreasonable to think that we could have a $15 billion franchise?

 

Well, taking that it is $55 billion right now, it's not unreasonable to think that in year 2030, could be that.

But it's not clear that it will be done.

 

So that will depend on the virus and how it behaves.

It will depend on if it will become standard practice to vaccinate together with flu.

 

If we will have a combination product, clearly, that will enhance this direction.

So I think it's a little bit too early, but no, it's not unreasonable to think given that where we are right now.

 

Now, what about NURTEC sales?



David Denton

Yes.

 

Steve, this is Dave.

As you said, we didn't own the business last quarter, but maybe just a little bit of color on how the product is performing.

 

If you look at the volume last year, or last quarter, rather, Q3, if you compare it to last year, it was about a 45% growth rate in year-over-year script volume.

And then if you look at it sequentially, which I think is really important, we saw about a 16% growth rate sequentially Q2 going into Q3.

 

So I think this shows the promise of this product, number one.

And number two, I think once we get it, now that we have it in the hands of our field force and into our primary care field force, we can really maximize the value of this needed medicine into the patient population here in the U.S.

 

and abroad.
Operator

Our next question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.

 



Robyn Karnauskas

Great.

 

On PAXLOVID, I was just -- I'm sure you saw the recent publication citing how many people have died from not even getting an antiviral.

Can you talk a little bit about the efforts you're making to educate physicians to give the drug?

 

And do you think we'll ever get to a point where people will be more comfortable, doctors will be more comfortable taking it, given all the news around the PAXLOVID rebound?

And second question, can you talk a little bit about the opportunity for vitiligo and alopecia in your pipeline?

 

And when should we hear the next readout?



Albert Bourla

Thank you very much.

 

Both questions, I think, can be answered very nicely by Angela.



Angela Hwang

Well, thank you for the question.

 

So we can just talk a little bit about PAXLOVID and how that's been going.

I mean, first and foremost, we are under an EUA, so that means that we are working hand-in-hand with the U.S.

 

government to ensure that we are providing the education to the public.

The U.S.

 

government and the state governments, I think, have created a tremendous amount of education already using public service announcements and public campaigns.

And equally, we have provided education to all the potential prescribers of PAXLOVID.

 

So if you think about where we are today, over 500,000 physicians have written PAXLOVID.

And what you have in addition to that is education that we've provided not only to doctors but also to pharmacists.

 

We've trained over 80,000 pharmacists in terms of how to write PAXLOVID.

And so I think the education is really firing off, both at a prescriber level but also at a consumer level where we have worked, again, also closely with state governments and local governments, to ensure that we're providing the right amount of education.

 

I will say that the Test to Treat sites that the government has stood up federally, there's now 27,000 of those around the country, have also been great sources of education for PAXLOVID.

So I think that it's -- frankly, I think it's going well.

 

I think that we're continuing to do more in anticipation of the fall.

But the fact that you've had 500,000 physicians write this PAXLOVID already is a great indicator of their confidence with this.

 

And the fact that probably, the one most important area of education that we need to continue to emphasize is just who are the eligible people for PAXLOVID.

And actually, if you look at the definition that the CDC provides, there are 22 risk factors for who should be eligible.

 

And they include those who are over 65, right, age-related risks, but equally, risks such as mental health illness, risks such as an inactive lifestyle, risks that you may not be aware of.

And so I think that that's really where we want to focus now through this fall.

 



Albert Bourla

And what about vitiligo?

 



Angela Hwang

I think we're really excited about these new indications for ritlecitinib.

 

I think probably the main theme here is that there are not effective -- there aren't any treatments for these highly -- very serious inflammatory conditions today.

So huge unmet need, huge -- just a place where there's just no options today.

 

So the fact that we're able to bring a treatment like this to market, I think, will have tremendous uptake by patients who up to now just are left with no options.



Albert Bourla

And William, can you please address a little bit the issue about the rebounds that was also mentioned?

 



William Pao

Sure, Albert.

 

Well, Mikael already mentioned that we gave updated data from our EPIC-HR study on the effect of PAXLOVID versus placebo in patients with high risk for COVID-19.

And we had additional end points there which we showed a 100% decrease in ICU admissions, a 100% decrease in mechanical ventilation among hospitalized patients, 100% who got PAXLOVID were DC-ed to home versus 53% placebo.

 

We also had 82% reduction in oxygen support, 86% reduction in COVID-19-related hospitalization, 89% reduction in mean days hospitalized versus 100 patients and also a 73% reduction in any COVID-19-related medical visits.

Importantly, we also showed sustained time to symptom alleviation and sustained time to symptom resolution of an impact of 2 to 3 days of PAXLOVID versus placebo.

 

But most importantly, about rebounds, there's been several studies recently that have shown actually that rebound occurs with COVID, in general.

For example, there was a recent publication of 158 patients who got placebo with COVID and actually, 1/3 of those had recurrent symptoms after the resolution of their symptoms, suggesting that it's a phenomenon associated with COVID and not with PAXLOVID.

 

Importantly, we also haven't seen any evidence of resistance that is clinically meaningful.

Whereas with antibodies, for example, we have seen that you can also can get symptom rebound, but that is associated with resistance.

 

So again, PAXLOVID is not associated with resistance but the antibodies are.

So we feel very confident that PAXLOVID has a significant impact and a role against COVID.

 
Operator

Next, we have Andrew Baum with Citi.

 



Andrew Baum

A couple of questions.

 

Firstly, as it relates to maternal RSV vaccine.

Could you talk about reimbursement coverage in the U.S.?

 

I'm assuming you'll get an ACIP recommendation.

And therefore, there will be 0 out of pocket, which may differentiate it versus the monoclonal.

 

And I'm sure on a cost basis, that will be material.

And then secondly, could you talk to your efforts with your ER degrader with Arvinas in light of the evolving data on SERDs?

 

Thinking about Astra's recent positive trial on MDS subgroup.

Do you believe that this is a function of defining the right patient population at the right stage of the disease rather than the potential risk to the development of the entire category?

 



Albert Bourla

Drew, thank you.

 

In the interest of time, let me give the first answer.

Yes, you are right.

 

As long as the product is recommended by CDC, and we believe with this type of efficacy, it will be recommended, there is 0 co-pay irrelevant of the insurance.

If it is commercial or if it is public, their obligation is 0 co-pay from the payers, and they have to cover it.

 

Mikael, what about the Arvinas molecules?



Mikael Dolsten

Yes.

 

Thank you for asking.

Clearly, we think that there are 2 factors that will separate out the good drugs from the less good in this class of degraders.

 

And we think that PROTAC, which is the mechanistic name of the 471, is more effective in down-regulating the estrogen receptor.

And selecting the right patients compared to standard of care, that includes selecting patients that have estrogen receptor mutations and need more powerful drugs and it's related to the property of the drug itself.

 

We look forward to advance that drug with Arvinas to pivotal studies in the relatively near future and also to soon reveal to you a lot of progress we had in our breast cancer franchise, including the CDK4 drug.

And that may be part of what we consider to share in December at the investor update on launches and next waves.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Mikael.

 

Another reason to attend this great event.
Operator

Next, we have Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.

 



Evan Seigerman

Congrats on the progress.

 

Two questions for me.

On BD, I want to be brief here.

 

But can you talk about what other therapeutic areas you might want to explore?

I know you're in neurology with Biohaven, nonmalignant hematology with GBT and, of course, inflammation.

 

Would you consider adding oncology?

And on the same line, kind of, Albert, in some previous comments ahead of this call, you had mentioned going alone with some of your mRNA technologies.

 

What applications of mRNA do you see outside of COVID?

I mean this personalized cancer vaccine is an area that you would explore.

 



Albert Bourla

Maybe I'll pass that to Aamir.

 



Aamir Malik

Sure.

 

Evan, thanks for the question.

As far as our therapeutic areas of focus, as I mentioned before in our priorities, our focus is on where we can make a difference and shape the science.

 

And the good news is we actually have distinctive capabilities across many different therapeutic areas.

So you've seen us active in internal medicine, anti-infectives, I&I and, certainly, oncology.

 

And our focus is going to be on where we have breakthrough science and the potential to shape it.

And we feel very good about the breadth of our scientific capabilities to give us lots of flexibility to work in different TAs.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Aamir.

 

Yes, we didn't answer the mRNA and how we think about it, Mikael.



Mikael Dolsten

Yes.

 

So I'm excited to share we're broadening that platform.

You heard about advance of the mRNA flu vaccine successfully to the next stages.

 

Albert mentioned plans that are ongoing to combine it with COVID vaccine to build more broader respiratory vaccine with indeed improved convenience in single administration, single-patient visits.

We are on our way to the Phase I study, together with BioNTech, on our shingles vaccine that really aim to deliver the power of the mRNA, but remove what we've seen as a pretty significant issue with of the current adjuvant vaccine.

 

We're looking at several other mRNA vaccine that we will share in proper time.

But also, that Aamir briefly alluded to, we have made progress in our alliance with Beam to really identify the first type of candidates that will move forward to genetic medicine in some of the important rare diseases.

 

And we're looking at application at certain areas of in vivo cancer medications, where we think this technology can be more successful where compared to the past of cancer vaccines.



Albert Bourla

Thank you very much, Mikael.

 
Operator

Next is Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.

 



Mohit Bansal

So on RSV vaccine side, I mean -- so the congress on the data in maternal vaccine, my question is Sanofi has an antibody which you can give to an infant directly and it shows good results.

 

So in your opinion, I mean, the strategy, there could be one strategy, you immunize moms, expecting moms versus infants directly.

How do you think about the end market shaking out eventually?

 



Albert Bourla

Yes.

 

Angela, do you want to say how we could compete potentially with an antibody in infants?



Angela Hwang

Yes.

 

I mean, first of all, if you look at where the -- most of the morbidity and mortality is happening, it's really at the under 6 months, right, in that age group and also with preterm babies.

And so you really need that protection from day 1.

 

And I think that that's where we believe our differentiation is.

From birth, literally from the moment of birth, you have protection.

 

And you have duration of protection throughout the 6 months, which is what we've shown in our clinical trial.

So I think while there -- I mean, obviously, it's great to have many different options.

 

I think that the option that we have with our vaccine is truly a unique one and one that plays well to the situation with the infants.



Albert Bourla

Thank you very much.

 

And of course, Andrew made also the point, with vaccines, we do not have co-pays.

And antibodies are quite expensive, and you do have co-pays.

 
Operator

Next, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.

 



Brian Tsang

This is Brian on for Tim.

 

Just two from us.

What is Pfizer's current level of interest in Alzheimer's disease?

 

And do you think there are compelling business development opportunities in the market?

Or would the efforts likely to be homegrown?

 

And then second, on the Prevnar 20 and the competition.

Wondering if you can opine on Merck's strategy, which is to bifurcate the market between peds and adults and have a product tailored to each segment.

 

They have strains in each and they will be going head-to-head against Prevnar.

They said a tailored approach is better than a one-size-fits-all approach, which is what Prevnar is.

 

Just wanted to get your thoughts on that.



Albert Bourla

Thank you very much.

 

Clearly, as you know, Pfizer had externalized their neuroscience portfolio, and we have created a company that's working on that actually.

And we have a very significant equity over there.

 

We are monitoring how science is evolving.

And apparently, there are a few things that are happening right now.

 

I'm not referring only to the positive data of one study that we just saw, I'm more referring to earlier science that is emerging that seems to have a high promising for most clinical results.

So we are monitoring that.

 

And if we think that there is a good opportunity, we may reexamine entering.

The reason why we actually want to exit is because we felt the science is not ready at the time.

 

Now I will move it to Angela to answer your second question.



Angela Hwang

We're really proud of our pneumococcal vaccine franchise.

 

And I want to begin with just talking about the great successes that Prevnar 20 has had since its launch.

Even though it's competing with other -- with another pneumococcal or other pneumococcal vaccines, we have a 95% market share.

 

We have 97% formulary access.

And we just recently had an updated ACIP recommendation that is going to enable Prevnar 20 to be used for catch-ups in those that are 65 plus as well as 65 under.

 

And so I think that, that is a great demonstration of the leadership and the legacy that Pfizer has in pneumococcal vaccines or respiratory vaccines and the tremendous relationships and knowledge that we have in the space.

Equally, that plays out in the pediatric space.

 

So even though we're obviously anticipating the launch of pediatric Prevnar 20, but in the meantime, Prevnar 13 is competing really well with the PCV15.

I think that, again, the relationships that we have, the deep trust and knowledge that physicians have of the -- of our pneumococcal vaccine is really standing -- is really helping us competitively.

 

And I think that there's great anticipation for the 5 additional serotypes that you're going to be able to get with Prevnar 20 over 15 in the pediatric space.

So I think all in all, we're off to an extremely strong start and we look forward to bringing our next vaccine to the market.

 



Albert Bourla

Okay.

 

Thank you very, very much.
Operator

Next, we have Chris Schott with JPMorgan.

 



Christopher Schott

Actually, kind of a qualitative question on how to think about OpEx dynamics going forward.

 

It seems like we've seen some upward bias in spend at the company, which has kind of coincided with the ramp in COVID sales.

I guess for a position where that COVID market resets as we transition past the pandemic, is there opportunity?

 

Or should we think about a pullback in OpEx spend associated with that?

Or should we think about these as more normalized levels of spend given all these growth initiatives that you're highlighting and investing behind at this point?

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Chris.

 

Nice question.

And our new CFO clearly has views on this.

 

So Dave, what do you think?



David Denton

Chris, good question.

 

Listen, before getting into -- it's probably a little too early for guidance for '23.

But my expectation is that there would not be a pullback in expenses.

 

I think if anything, what we're fortunate to have is a very robust launch schedule over the next 18 months.

And we're really focused on investing to make sure that those launches are extremely successful and these medicines get in the hands of patients pretty quickly.

 

And so if anything, our focus is to get behind these launches, make sure that we execute them flawlessly and that we see the ramp-up and drive our sales performance, particularly in the 2025 to 2030 time frame.
Operator

Next is Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.

 



Geoff Meacham

Thanks for the question.

 

Just had a few.

The slide on long-term growth is really helpful.

 

On the $20 billion on Slide 9 that you guys have highlighted, can you talk to the long-term contribution that is not COVID?

I know there's some -- there's a long-term piece for COVID, but most investors are focused on kind of the non-COVID drivers.

 

And then on I&I, looking to next year when we'll have many biosimilars launching for Humira, how much of market disruption do you think we'll see from higher buyers, similar volumes and payer preferences?

I'm thinking about the effect on CIBINQO and then the etrasimod launch specifically, but also Xeljanz and Inflectra.

 



Albert Bourla

Yes.

 

I will ask Angela to answer the second question.

On the first one, maybe I can give some clarifications.

 

On the $20 billion, so we have included revenues from new launches.

This is our estimations for 2030.

 

New launches that are happening either started in '22, CIBINQO, for example, is there, because it started.

And then we are adding claims or are about to happen and we have the list in the appendix.

 

And in this list, excluding the BD, which we do not count over there, we count on the previous bar, where we have the $25 billion of revenues, are summing to $20 billion in our expectation.

Just to clarify, this does not include COVID.

 

This is excluding COVID, excluding new things that may come from COVID, excluding new things that may come in antivirals or new vaccines or combination vaccines or any of that.

These are not part of that.

 

Now in the other pipeline, which are things that are not in the near, near short term and things that will launch after the 18 months period all the way to '30, clearly, a lot of these things maybe are not known to you yet.

But among the things that are known to you and that should be included over there, should be the GLP-1, should be any combinations between flu and COVID or RSV, should be our interferon , and the Lyme vaccines, the Arvinas, should be the gene therapies that could come.

 

All of that should count towards that bar that we haven't quantified yet publicly.

Of course, we know what we expect ourselves.

 

Thank you very much.

Now, Angela.

 

The I&I and the vaccine launch.



Angela Hwang

So the way to think about it is the biologics market and the oral market is -- the way we think about it is that it's different.

 

And the reason I say that is because there is -- if you look at the treatment algorithms and how the biologics are used and how the orals are used, you picked Xeljanz as an example, right?

Clearly, there, the label says that you have to have used anti-TNF before you move on to an oral JAK.

 

And so I don't think that the competition is across biologics.

With orals, I think the competition is literally with HUMIRA and the biosimilars of Humira, and then the orals have their role.

 

So I'll use Xeljanz as one example.

I'll use etrasimod as another example.

 

There, the benefit of this is that you have an oral therapy that actually can be used earlier line and actually pre-biologic.

So again, there, you -- it's the different lines of treatment and the fact that I think there are distinct places where you would use an oral and a distinct place where you would use a biologic, and I don't think that's the crossover.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Angela.

 

We're running a little bit late, so we'll have 3 more questions.

And we'll try to make -- answer them very quickly.

 
Operator

Next is Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.

 



Terence Flynn

I was just wondering on PAXLOVID, it looks like there's going to be some doses remaining on the current U.S.

 

contract as we head into 2023.

So just maybe, I know you talked about how COMIRNATY would work as we move to a commercial market.

 

But maybe just help us think about how that will work here in the U.S.

as we transition out of the pandemic here.

 

And the second question I had is just any more detail you can share on the Prevnar data in peds regarding the serotype coverage?

I know that was a question that came out post the Phase III data.

 



Albert Bourla

Very quickly on the PAXLOVID, it is not very different than what is happening with the vaccine.

 

There will be a transition period.

We will have to announce the list price, then we have to work with the U.S.

 

government to transition so that when they stop distributing their, let's say, goods that they have, we will, let's say, start and we have a seamless transition.

So the market will always become covered.

 

But we will give more details given these dynamics, what happens and when this happens, the transition at next -- in the guidance for next year.

Mikael, anything you have to say on the pediatrics?

 



Mikael Dolsten

Just very brief that we have had positive studies in U.S.

 

3-plus-1 schedule, European Union 2-plus-1, after either 4 or 3 doses, which is the toddler complete schedule.

We covered 20 serotypes in U.S.

 

and 19 in the EU.

But the totality of data across all endpoints, we believe, clearly speaks to that this is an important vaccine that adds coverage.

 

And it's likely going to be the vaccine in the near term and for quite many years that have the broadest coverage.
Operator

Next, we have Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.

 



Chris Shibutani

In terms of RSV, if you could share some thoughts in terms of the velocity of the uptake that you're expecting?

 

Is flu a good barometer?

And how quickly do you think, if that's the case, that we could possibly reach through?

 

And then with etrasimod, in the previous owner's hands, there were additional opportunities, I believe, Crohn's disease data, Phase II; atopic dermatitis, Phase III, were originally in the time lines for calendar 2022.

Will we get some insights on that -- on those clinical programs?

 



Albert Bourla

Yes.

 

I will ask -- actually, for the clinical programs, William, to speak a little bit about that.



William Pao

Yes.

 

Sure.

For etrasimod, we have nothing new to update at this time, Chris.

 



Albert Bourla

All right.

 

And then for RSV, I would say, clearly, we think that it could become like flu-like.

I think all respiratory disease eventually will have coverage like we have right now in flu.

 

The question is how often that will happen.

And that will depend on several factors.

 

Education, of course, of the people and their physicians, but also the availability of combination programs and products that could significantly bring all 3 of them together, RSV, COVID and flu.
Operator

Next, we have Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.

 



Umer Raffat

I wanted to ask two questions on pricing today, if I may.

 

Perhaps first one, Albert, I know the COVID vaccine repricing was a very bold decision.

And I understand the dynamics around the value proposition, the pandemic versus endemic era pricing, et cetera.

 

But I think the sheer magnitude of the increase is making a lot of investors ask questions around ESG implications, any political blowback, et cetera.

I'm just curious how you guys thought about this very important decision and how you're thinking about the expectation on net pricing.

 

And then separately, on PAXLOVID.

I know you're running a 10-day trial versus the 5-day course that's currently approved.

 

Does that mean PAXLOVID will effectively become 2x the price once a 10-day course is approved?



Albert Bourla

Yes.

 

I can answer both of them.

Look, I think what was very bold and the right absolutely decision was to price the PAXLOVID during the pandemic at a very, very, very low price.

 

Clearly, the price that -- excuse me, the vaccine at a very, very low price.

That was the right thing to do, and we did it and we maintained that for the years to come.

 

Now that we are coming to the end of this period and as we are moving to very different product, which has very different presentations, which are -- now we are moving to single instead of mass vial, multi-dose vial, we are pricing the vaccine according to the cost effectiveness.

And the cost effectiveness of the current vaccine, the way that CDC is pricing it, is way, way, way below than what the price that we have set at $110 and $130.

 

Also, keep in mind that people will not see any difference and the system will get the benefit of a cost-effective product.

And the people wouldn't see any difference because there's no copay.

 

Now on the PAXLOVID, I think it's too early to speak.

We haven't announced any price.

 

And we do not know what will be the outcome of the studies or the outcome of a new class that is coming following PAXLOVID.
Operator

Our last question will come from David Risinger with SVB Securities.

 



David Risinger

So my two questions are regarding the core growth, which was 2% operationally in the third quarter, could you talk about what you're assuming and how we should think about growth prospects in the future, specifically in the fourth quarter since you've guided to that in your updated guidance?

 

And then second, could you provide an update -- and I might have missed this, if I did, I apologize.

But could you provide an update on your next-gen oral antiviral for COVID?

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you.

 

One, on the 2% operational, excluding COVID, just to make a clarification, if you exclude also the contract manufacturing business that we have that was really COVID-related, it has very increased revenues last year because we were contract manufacturing for BioNTech territories that we don't have to do now because BioNTech took over for their territories their own manufacturing.

In fact, the growth was 4% of our pharmaceutical business, excluding COVID and excluding this piece of contract manufacturing.

 

Now Angela, based on that, what will we expect to be the growth trajectory?



Angela Hwang

Well, we've talked about our 5-year CAGR, right, to be 6%.

 

And just I want to reiterate that, that is exactly the track that we're on.

Every year does not necessarily have to look identical.

 

But over the 5-year period, we're absolutely confident that we're going to deliver the 6% CAGR.



Albert Bourla

All right.

 

So thank you very much.

So with that, I think we are close to bring our call to a close.

 

Please don't forget to attend our event on December 12, where we will provide details about our very important new product launches in the next 18 months in some of our most important pipeline, potential new medicines and vaccines.

Thank you for joining us today.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Analyst Call for the GSK Third Quarter 2022 Results.

 

I will now hand you over to Nick Stone, Head of Global Investor Relations, who will introduce today's session.

Nick, please go ahead.

 



Nick Stone

Thank you, operator.

 

Hello, everyone.

It's Nick, as just mentioned.

 

Welcome to our year-to-date and Q3 2022 conference call and webcast for investors and analysts.

Earlier today, the presentation was posted to gsk.com.

 

And it was also sent by e-mail to our distribution list.

Please turn to Slide 2.

 

This is the usual safe harbor statement, and we'll be making comments on our performance using constant exchange rates, or CER, unless stated otherwise.

As a reminder, the Consumer Healthcare business was demerged on the 18th of July to form Haleon.

 

And as a result, we are today presenting continuing operations for GSK.

Turning to Slide 3.

 

This is today's agenda, where we plan to cover all aspects of our year-to-date and Q3 2022 results.

The presentation will last approximately 35 minutes, with around 40 minutes for questions.

 

[Operator Instructions].

Today, our speakers are Emma Walmsley, Tony Wood on the phone, Luke Miels, Deborah Waterhouse and Iain Mackay.

 

The Q&A portion of the call will also be joined by David Redfern.

Turning to Slide 4.

 

I'll now hand the call over to Emma.



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Nick, and hello to everyone joining our Q3 conference call today.

 

Please turn to the next slide.

I'm very pleased with today's results, which demonstrate that our strategy is driving the step change in performance and landmark year we committed to.

 

Year-to-date, we've delivered double-digit sales growth of 19%, adjusted operating profit growth of 16%, adjusted EPS growth of 20% and strong free cash flow of GBP 2.5 billion.

This broad-based momentum and our continued pipeline progress support my strong confidence heading into 2023 and in our medium-term outlook and growth through the decade.

 

Based on these encouraging results and our excellent momentum, we're again increasing our full year guidance, which excludes COVID solutions.

We now expect sales to increase by between 8% to 10%, with improving outlook in all 3 product areas; adjusted operating profit growth between 15% to 17%; and adjusted EPS growth around 1% below adjusted operating profit.

 

Please turn to Slide 6.

In Q3, we delivered another quarter of growth, with sales increasing 9% to GBP 7.8 billion; adjusted operating profit growing 4% to GBP 2.6 billion, an increase of 2%, excluding COVID solutions; and adjusted EPS growth of 11% to 46.9p.

 

This performance was driven by consistently strong commercial execution all across our business as we build our broad portfolio of scale medicines and vaccines, with Specialty Medicines growing 24% to GBP 2.7 billion and by 11% excluding Xevudy.

Here, we continue to benefit from demand for our HIV medicines, particularly Dovato and Cabenuva as well as Nucala in respiratory and Benlysta in immunology.

 

Vaccine sales grew by 5% to GBP 2.5 billion and by 9% excluding pandemic vaccines.

This strong performance reflected another record quarter for Shingrix, with sales exceeding GBP 750 million.

 

And lastly, General Medicines sales grew 1% to GBP 2.6 billion, driven by the strong growth of Trelegy in respiratory.

And we continue to invest in commercial growth and our R&D pipeline.

 

In SG&A, we continued our disciplined cost control while prioritizing effective investments behind launches, particularly Shingrix as we accelerated international expansion, and in HIV to drive the growth of our innovation [indiscernible].

In R&D, we continued to increase investments in Vaccines' clinical development, including an mRNA technology and the newly acquired Affinivax MAPS platform as well as in late-stage specialty meds, particularly the Phase III program for depemokimab in severe asthma.

 

We also continued our investment behind several earlier-stage research projects.

Turning to Slide 7 and our pipeline headline.

 

This quarter, we took significant steps to progress our pipeline and platform capabilities.

And of course, we're now delighted to have Tony as Chief Scientific Officer, and you'll hear more from him in a moment.

 

It was great to present at ID Week the Phase III results of our RSV older adults vaccine, which demonstrated more than 90% efficacy against severe disease, and wonderful to have received U.S.

Priority Review as well as regulatory submission acceptances in Europe and Japan all over the last couple of weeks.

 

Overall, we believe our RSV vaccine has a potential best-in-class profile, and we're very excited about the potential benefits it can bring to older adults.

And of course, it's a tremendous commercial opportunity for GSK.

 

During the quarter, we also received several important regulatory approvals in our Vaccines business.

And as we close out this landmark year, we look forward to further news flow across the portfolio.

 

I do want to reiterate, there are no changes in our capital allocation priorities.

As a company, we continue to focus on making significant improvements in R&D productivity and performing competitively in the field, with our pipeline remaining our top priority.

 

We'll continue to focus investments across 4 therapeutic areas while adding complementary and strategic business development to bring additional optionality.

This quarter, we completed the important acquisition of Affinivax and gained access to a Phase II, next-generation 24-valent vaccine.

 

We also signed an exclusive license agreement with Spero Therapeutics for tebipenem, a novel oral antibiotic in late-stage development for UTIs.

Importantly, we are consistently driving pipeline momentum.

 

This remains our priority and, alongside our strong commercial performance, makes us stronger and better positioned to achieve our ambitions than we were even a year ago.

And now, Tony, first to you on Slide 8.

 



Tony Wood

Thank you, Emma.

 

Next slide, please.

Our shared purpose within GSK is to unite science, technology and talent to get ahead of disease together.

 

I want to spend the next few minutes explaining how R&D will support this objective and how I expect the organization to evolve under my leadership.

First, it's essential to recognize that GSK has changed.

 

We have developed a unique operating model based on the science of the immune system, human genetics and advanced technologies.

With this, we delivered a much more competitive performance in new drug approvals.

 

This is encouraging and something our organization can be proud of, but there's more to be done.

I'm confident we can further strengthen our pipeline of innovative and practice-changing new vaccines and medicines to deliver long-term competitive growth.

 

To achieve this, we will rigorously prioritize R&D capital allocation in our 4 therapeutic areas.

To achieve these objectives, I have 3 key priorities for R&D.

 

My first priority is to execute flawlessly on our pipeline, today consisting of 23 vaccines and 42 medicines.

Flawless execution means prosecuting the development of our late-stage pipeline, bringing new vaccines and medicines to patients as quickly as possible, organically and through business development.

 

It also means accelerating our development of our most promising preclinical and early-stage research projects.

Our guiding question will be: Can this meaningfully improve patient outcomes and deliver a new standard of care?

 

My second key priority is exploiting new and existing platform and data technology to identify and accelerate clinical development opportunities.

We already have a broad set of platform technologies, including an unrivaled suite within Vaccines.

 

We'll continue to add to this, augmenting our capabilities.

To illustrate this, we leveraged our world-leading protein adjuvant capabilities to deliver a best-in-class RSV vaccine candidate for older adults.

 

Likewise, through complementary strategic development, we acquired Affinivax and the disruptive MAPS technology mentioned by Emma.

This allows us to develop multivalent vaccines for complex bacterial infections.

 

In data technology, we have access to the richest and largest data set, thanks to our data-focused collaborations, including our recent agreement with Tempus, which provides access to one of the world's largest sources of deidentified patient data to accelerate drug discovery.

My third priority relates to R&D culture.

 

A key element of my job is to create an environment in which we are ambitious for patients and where our people are empowered to take smart risks and make the right decision at the right time.

First, taking smart risks is not solely a scientific endeavor.

 

Luke and I chair a portfolio review board with cross-functional teams, providing input into all key R&D decisions.

My partnership with Luke and Deborah is key and has never been more important as we allocate capital towards those new vaccines and medicines that have the greatest potential to raise the bar for patients.

 

Please turn to Slide 10.

We will continue focusing on developing innovative vaccines and specialty medicines.

 

Infectious diseases and HIV now represent about 2/3 of our pipeline and are the primary focus for R&D.

We have an opportunity to build on our leading position in vaccines and complement the extraordinary success with Shingrix with new vaccine candidates for RSV in older adults, meningitis and pneumococcal disease.

 

In HIV, we are true innovation pioneers.

We've led the way with 2 drug regimens and long-acting injectable medicines.

 

We'll strengthen our leading position with longer-acting and more convenient treatments to people living with HIV and alternative options in pre-exposure prophylaxis.

At the intersection of infectious disease and immunology, we're developing bepirovirsen, a potentially transformative treatment for people living with chronic hepatitis B, which is responsible for around 900,000 deaths annually.

 

Bepi also represents a foundational asset of a new oligonucleotide platform that will increase our scope to prosecute promising new research targets from our leading position in genetics.

We will prioritize immunology, respiratory and oncology programs using human genetics, functional genomics and AI/ML to support smart risk-taking.

 

Within oncology, our primary focus is Jemperli and the CD226 axis.

And outside of IO, we'll take a pragmatic approach within synthetic lethality and tumor cell targeting.

 

In business development, we will remain agile and ambitious, looking for opportunities that address high unmet medical needs and complement our R&D strategy.

We'll also target opportunities with genetic evidence that suggests a higher probability of success.

 

Let me now review some of the recent highlights within our pipeline.

Please turn to Slide 11.

 

This quarter's highlight was the exceptional Phase III data for our novel RSV vaccine in older adults presented at ID Week.

RSV is a common contagious respiratory virus responsible for around 420,000 hospitalizations and 29,000 deaths annually in developed countries.

 

RSV disease is a significant burden on the elderly, with almost half of all U.S.

cases observed in the over 65s.

 

Our data demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in older adults, with 94% protection against severe RSV disease.

The vaccine showed consistent and sustained high efficacy against RSV A and B strains in people in the 70s and those with comorbidities.

 

The latter group is significant, with over 90% of adult hospitalized with RS disease -- RSV disease having underlying medical conditions.

These patients suffer the most and have the greatest impact on health care costs.

 

We've submitted these data as part of a comprehensive package, which includes data demonstrating that the RSV vaccine can be coadministered with an influenza vaccine safely and without diminishing the immune response against either vaccine, an important consideration to the target population.

To date, we've received regulatory acceptance of our submissions by the European Medicines Agency and in Japan.

 

And yesterday, we received U.S.

regulatory acceptance and Priority Review with a goal date of the 3rd of May 2023, putting us firmly on track for June ACIP.

 

Now moving to significant pipeline events, which occurred in 3Q, please turn to Slide 12.

Earlier this quarter, we presented 10-year data for Shingrix also at ID Week.

 

This demonstrated a persistent immune response and illustrated that the duration of protection against shingles extends to 10 years after vaccination.

These data underscore the advantages of our proprietary adjuvant technology and setting new gold standard that will be very difficult to beat.

 

In HIV, we presented data from the Phase IIa proof-of-concept bNAb study for N6LS, our broadly neutralizing antibody.

These early data show that a single infusion demonstrates strong antiviral activity.

 

The decline in viral load, duration of response and good tolerability observed at 2 doses suggest a potential best-in-class antibody treatment.

Next week, at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Conference, we will present the B-Clear end-of-study data for bepirovirsen, a potential new treatment for people living with hepatitis B.

 

This is an important trial because it demonstrates for the first time that bepi alone or in combination with antiviral nucleotide or nucleoside can deliver a sustained reduction in both viral DNA and HBV surface antigen, which together are key measures of efficacy.

B-Clear also identified a clear predictor of response that will guide future development.

 

We are currently in discussion with the regulators about the design of Phase III studies, and I look forward to providing an update at our full year results in February.

In oncology, we announced positive headline results for the PERLA Phase II trial, the largest head-to-head trial of PD-1 inhibitors in non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer.

 

PERLA evaluated Jemperli versus pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy but was not designed to demonstrate superiority.

These data will be used to support future clinical development of novel combinations.

 

We also announced that both arms of the COSTAR lung trial would progress into Phase III.

This 3-arm trial compares cobolimab, dostarlimab and chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have progressed on prior PD-L1 therapy and chemotherapy.

 

Last week, the U.S.

FDA Cardiorenal and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee reviewed our application for daprodustat.

 

We are pleased the committee recognized the potential for daprodustat to help certain patients living with anemia of chronic kidney disease, given their limited treatment options.

We look forward to working with the FDA as they complete their review of our new drug application.

 

Our PDUFA action date has been set for the 1st of February 2023.

Finally, we decided we will progress otilimab.

 

Although the pivotal ContRAst trial's met their primary endpoints, the efficacy demonstrated is unlikely to transform care for this difficult-to-treat population.

Please turn to Slide 13.

 

Looking ahead, we anticipate several significant late-stage readouts and regulatory decisions over the next 12 months.

I won't attempt to go through everything on this slide, but I want to highlight few key events.

 

In particular, before year-end, we expect to report data from our pentavalent meningococcal vaccine, MenABCWY, as well as data from the RUBY trial in first-line endometrial cancer for Jemperli.

For Blenrep, we're on track to provide an update for DREAMM-3 before the end of the year.

 

And we anticipate data from DREAMM-7 and DREAMM-8 in the second-line setting in 2023.

We also expect FDA regulatory decisions for daprodustat and momelotinib in the first half of 2023.

 

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Luke.

Please turn to Slide 14.

 



Luke Miels

Thanks, Tony.

 

Please turn to Slide 15.

So in Q3, we saw strong execution across commercial operations, with total sales growth of 9% in the quarter and increasing demand from all product groups.

 

2 percentage points of growth came from Xevudy, so the ex pandemic overall sales growth of 7%.

Based on this good performance and our ongoing momentum, we've increased our full year sales guidance Specialty Medicines to low double digits, excluding Xevudy.

 

As usual, Deborah will comment on HIV, while I highlight a few key dynamics.

In immunology, Benlysta continues to be the leader in lupus, with sustained growth across major markets, including the U.S., where we're getting 80% of new starts.

 

We're also making good progress with the lupus nephritis indication, now reaching around 15% of patients in the U.S.

with plenty of room to grow.

 

For Nucala, we continue to be the first and only biologic approved for 4 eos-driven diseases and are leading the IL-5 class across all major markets.

In the U.S., we have now had more than 50% market share for all our approved indications, and we're on track to potentially add a fifth, with our Phase III COPD trial due to complete in the first half of 2024.

 

In oncology, our in-line and launched brands delivered double-digit growth, achieving GBP 164 million in the quarter, including Zejula, which was up 11%, and Blenrep up 32%.

In General Medicines, we continue to lead the single inhaler therapy class with Trelegy and saw an increase in demand for Augmentin due to the postpandemic rebound of the antibiotic market.

 

As a result of this performance in the quarter and year-to-date, we now expect full year sales for gen meds to be broadly flat, which compares to the slight decrease that was previously signaled.

Turning to our Vaccines' performance on Slide 16.

 

Our Vaccines' performance was very strong, with sales growth of 9%, excluding the impact of prior year pandemic vaccine sales.

This growth was driven by the continued recovery of Shingrix, where we delivered another record quarter of turnover.

 

In the U.S., Shingrix sales benefited from higher demand in both retail and nonretail channels, which was partly offset by expected unfavorable wholesale inventory movements.

Outside the U.S., we are seeing the growing impact of new launches and strong commercial execution in Europe and international, with nearly 40% of Shingrix's Q3 sales now coming from markets outside of the U.S.

 

Shingrix is now available in 25 countries with 2 new launches during Q3, and we remain on track to expand our geographic footprint.

In 2024, we plan to be in 35 countries, representing nearly 90% of the global vaccines market.

 

And we continue to expect Shingrix to deliver record year performance with strong double-digit sales growth this year.

We now expect fourth quarter growth to be lower than in previous quarter due to expected inventory burn in the U.S., reflecting the drawdown in inventory channel build from earlier this year.

 

For Vaccines overall, excluding pandemic solutions, we expect sales growth for the full year in the mid- to high teens, up from our low to mid-teens expectation in Q2.

This reflects strong commercial execution across the portfolio and increased contributions from Bexsero in the U.S.

 

due to higher CDC purchases and increased market share versus Pfizer.

Let me now hand over to Deborah on Slide 17.

 



Deborah Waterhouse

Thanks, Luke.

 

We delivered another good quarter with HIV sales of GBP 1.5 billion, up 7%, taking year-to-date growth to 9%.

Performance benefited from strong patient demand for our innovation portfolio, which comprises Dovato, Cabenuva, Juluca, Rukobia and Apretude, and now accounts for 44% of our sales.

 

Strong growth of 11% in each of the U.S.

and Europe was the result of excellent commercial execution behind our 2 drug regimens and Dovato in particular.

 

For the first time in a quarter, Dovato sales exceeded those of Tivicay, with Dovato accounting for almost 25% of our total HIV business.

Turning to our injectable portfolio.

 

Cabenuva, also known as Vocabria/Rekambys in Europe, is our first-in-class long-acting treatment regimen for HIV.

Sales for the quarter were GBP 101 million, reflecting strong patient demand.

 

At AIDS 2022, we were pleased to present new data from the CARISEL study, demonstrating successful implementation of the Vocabria/Rekambys across a range of European health care settings.

More than 80% of study [indiscernible] supported that the complete long-acting regimen was less stigmatizing than daily oral treatment.

 

The outlook for this innovative medicine is compelling, with strong brand recognition and high levels of market access and reimbursement across the U.S.

and Europe.

 

Moving on to prevention.

Apretude is the world's first long-acting injectable for the prevention of HIV dosed every 2 months.

 

Launched in the U.S.

in January, Apretude delivered GBP 10 million of sales in the quarter.

 

HIV prevention is an area of huge unmet need as current medical options are associated with stigma and adherence issues.

Apretude addresses these issues and has demonstrated superior efficacy over daily oral tablets.

 

In the last week, has accepted our application to make Apretude available for people who would benefit from PrEP in Europe.

This is an important step forward in offering expanded options for HIV prevention.

 

And finally, we were pleased to present more than 50 abstracts across the recent scientific congresses ID Week and HIV Glasgow.

The highlight, as Tony mentioned earlier, was the positive proof-of-concept data from the bNAb study of N6LS, our investigational, broadly neutralizing antibody.

 

In conclusion, our Q3 results demonstrate continued positive momentum towards delivering our 2026 outlook and successfully evolving our product mix to the end of the decade.

I will now hand over to Iain.

 

Next slide, please.



Iain Mackay

Thanks, Deborah.

 

As I cover the financials, references to growth are at constant exchange rates unless stated otherwise.

As Luke has covered the main revenue drivers, I'll focus my comments on the income statement, including margins, cash flow, capital allocation and guidance.

 

Please turn to Slide 19.

Whilst my comments will focus on continuing operations, I will start by covering the effect of the demerger in total results.

 

Total earnings per share were 255.9p, of which earnings per share from discontinued operations were 237.1p in the quarter.

This reflected GBP 9.6 billion profit after taxation for the gain arising in the demerger of Consumer Healthcare.

 

This was comprised of a GBP 7.2 billion gain on demerger and a GBP 2.4 billion gain on the retained stake in Haleon.

Turning now to continuing operations.

 

For the third quarter of 2022, Commercial Operations turnover was GBP 7.8 billion, up 9%, and adjusted operating profit was GBP 2.6 billion, up 4%.

Total earnings per share were 18.8p, down 35%, while adjusted earnings per share were 46.9p, up 11%.

 

The main adjusting items of note between total and adjusted results for continuing operations in Q3 were in transaction related, which primarily reflected ViiV contingent consideration liability movements, the majority of which related to foreign exchange, and in divestments, significant, legal and other, which reflected a fair value movement -- sorry, fair value mark-to-market loss on retained stake in Haleon.

Pandemic solutions increased growth of adjusted operating profit by approximately 2 percentage points and growth of adjusted earnings per share by around 3 points.

 

The Q3 currency impact was a favorable 9% on sales and 14% in adjusted earnings per share.

Turning to next slide.

 

The Q3 margin of 33.3% was stable and aligned with 2021's delivery.

The positive margin dynamics reflected the sales growth with a favorable mix, excluding Xevudy, higher royalty income and favorable currency movements, which were a 1.6-percentage-point benefit in the third quarter.

 

These factors were offset by the impact of lower margin sales of Xevudy and continued commercial investment behind launches and key products.

COVID solutions increased adjusted profit growth by approximately 2 percentage points.

 

And the adjusted operating margin, excluding COVID solutions, was approximately 1.3 percentage points lower at constant exchange rates.

Within cost of goods sold, the increase primarily related to sales of lower margins of Xevudy, which increased the cost of sales margin by around 2 percentage points, mainly reflecting the profit share pay away to Vir Biotechnology.

 

Excluding Xevudy, cost of goods sold benefited from a favorable business mix, with Specialty Medicines and Vaccines comprising 65% of Commercial Operations sales ex pandemic.

So this mix benefit was offset by increased supply chain costs, including commodity prices and freight, which we continue to manage closely.

 

SG&A increased at a higher rate than sales in the quarter, which reflected launch investments in Specialty Medicines and Vaccines.

This was particularly focused on HIV and Shingrix to drive postpandemic demand recovery and support market expansion.

 

Trade and distribution costs also contributed to the increase.

These factors were partly offset by continued delivery of restructuring benefits and the gains on the Vir Biotechnology collaboration profit share.

 

R&D spend grew 8% in the quarter, with increased investment across several programs, particularly in Vaccines' clinical development, including our mRNA technology platforms and MAPS following the Affinivax acquisition; in Specialty Medicines, with assets like depemokimab and momelotinib; and in early-stage research programs.

These increases were partly offset by the lapping of now completed late-stage clinical programs and ongoing efficiencies.

 

Royalties benefited from Biktarvy contribution and higher sales of Gardasil.

In the year-to-date, adjusted operating profit grew 16% to GBP 6.6 billion, with an operating margin of 29.9%, reflecting the strong business performance.

 

In the commercial [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] solutions, operating profit was neutral.

Turning to Slide 21.

 

Moving to [indiscernible] this time now, I would highlight that net finance expense was slightly lower, reflecting increased interest income due to higher interest rates and larger cash balances following the demerger.

And the effective tax rate of 16.6% reflected the timing of settlements with various tax authorities.

 

On the next slide, I'll cover cash flow.

In the year-to-date, we generated GBP 2.5 billion of free cash flow from continuing operations.

 

The main driver of higher free cash flow this year has been higher cash generated from operations, which has grown 49% to GBP 5.8 billion.

And this has primarily benefited from increased operating profit, including the upfront income from the Gilead settlement in February, a favorable foreign exchange impact and favorable timing of collections.

 

And these factors were partly offset by unfavorable timing of profit share payments for sales of Xevudy, increased contingent consideration payments reflecting the Gilead settlement and increased cash contributions to pensions in the third quarter.

Below cash generated from operations, there were higher tax payments and reduced purchase of intangibles, partly offset by lower proceeds from disposals and increased capital investments.

 

We continue to have a keen focus on cash generation, and we're pleased with our progress this year.

I'll take the opportunity to reiterate our capital allocation framework, which supports continuing investment in the business for future growth through R&D, both organic and inorganic, as evidenced by Sierra Oncology and Affinivax deals, through commercial excellence, new product launches and effective capital projects as well as delivering growing and sustainable shareholder returns, including through our dividend policy.

 

Our strength in balance sheet provides a basis from which we can execute this policy, with net debt standing at around GBP 18 billion after the recent acquisitions.

This provides greater flexibility and supports our maintenance of a strong investment-grade rating.

 

Turning now to Slide 23.

Moving on to guidance.

 

Q3 performance was again slightly better than our expectations, and our year-to-date delivery has been strong.

Taking that momentum and the positive fundamentals into account, we're again raising our guidance for full year 2022.

 

We now expect sales, excluding COVID solutions, to increase between 8% and 10% at constant exchange rates, and for adjusted operating profit to increase between 15% and 17%.

We expect the year-on-year impact from COVID solutions to reduce adjusted operating profit growth by around 4% for the full year.

 

In the fourth quarter, we anticipate a relatively higher rate of R&D spend, reflecting prior year comparisons and in-year phasing as well as continued targeted investment.

In the run for the full year, we also expect adjusted earnings per share to be 1% lower than adjusted operating profit growth, reflecting the balance of adjustments to the expected effective tax and interest expense charges.

 

For the third quarter, we've declared a dividend of 13.75p per share, in line with expectations.

Before closing, let me touch on Zantac given the impact it has had in the stock price over recent months.

 

We set out the facts in the press releases on the 11th and 16th of August, and today's results release provides the latest information on the U.S.

cases.

 

GSK's position on the scientific validity of these cases has not changed, and we'll continue to defend all claims vigorously.

As you will have seen, we await the outcome of Daubert hearings over the coming weeks, and we will, of course, continue to update the market as things evolve.

 

We continue to be highly confident in the performance of the business and are optimistic that the step change in delivery that we've seen in 2022 to date will continue in Q4 and will set up GSK for another year of success in 2023.

And with that, I'll hand it back to Emma.

 



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Iain.

 

And turning lastly to Slide 25.

We continue to be guided by our purpose to unite science, technology and talent to get ahead of disease together.

 

Integral to this is running a responsible business, which builds trust and reduces [indiscernible] health impact, shareholder returns and supporting our people to thrive.

This quarter, we advanced our environmental leadership by launching our Sustainable Procurement Programme at Climate Week in New York.

 

The recently announced S&P Corporate Sustainability Assessment also recognized our sustainability leadership.

And we were also delighted to gain World Health Organization prequalification for our malaria vaccine, a key step in making this groundbreaking vaccine available to more children.

 

In closing, I want to thank our people for delivering this tremendous performance momentum.

I'm deeply committed to GSK being a company that helps our talented people thrive, and we recognize the significant pressures many are experiencing due to the unprecedented context and the practicalities of the rising cost of living in many parts of the world.

 

And this quarter, we invested in supporting those most affected as well as in company-wide enhanced benefits and well-being support.

Together, we are delivering our landmark year, also with another quarter of strong performance, upgraded guidance and excellent momentum as we look to the years ahead as a focused global biopharma company.

 

We are well on track to meet our bold ambitions for patients and our commitments to competitive growth for the decade ahead.

With that, operator, can we please move to the Q&A?

 
Operator

[Operator Instructions].

 

And with that, our first question comes from James Gordon from JPM.



James Gordon

James Gordon from JPMorgan.

 

First question was on older adult RSV vaccine.

So we now have the GSK and the Pfizer data in the public domain.

 

What can we say on the comparative efficacy and tolerability?

Are you still seeing GSK taking the dominant market share?

 

Or could these end up being similar products with the same ACIP recommendation because maybe you've got better efficacy but not so good on tolerability?

And what could a product like this -- what might the ramp look like?

 

Is Shingrix a proxy?

And if I could also just squeeze in a follow-up question, which is a more general one on the pipeline.

 

So a question for Tony, which would be, how are you thinking about peak sales potential for the pipeline?

It seems like oncology is a bit less of a focus than before.

 

And there were some quite plenty targets set before.

So Blenrep Zejula, Jemperli, they're multibillion dollar products [indiscernible] forecast?

 

Or might those be under review?

And are there other areas maybe outside oncology where you see higher peak sales potential?

 



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, James.

 

Well, 2 quite chunky questions there.

I'll come to Tony first, and let's deal with the RSV question.

 

But then I think, Tony, you can talk about the data, both on efficacy and tolerability, and Luke, perhaps you can pick up on the ramp.

And then we'll come back on your question on overall pipeline strength and prospects.

 

I just want to reiterate, James, what I said in my comments, which is compared to where we were just a year ago when we presented both our outlooks for growth and the 5-year horizon and a snapshot in that moment of time of the risk-adjusted pipeline, we are in a better and stronger position when we look across those 3 periods on a net basis.

Obviously, some things go away.

 

Other things have matured.

And as you know, we've added business development and maturing early pipeline in a fairly material way as well.

 

So we would always expect that to keep adjusting.

But first of all, let's deal with RSV in the round, and then we'll come back.

 

Tony, if you want to comment on -- building on your presentation on some of the pipeline assets.

But RSV first, please.

 



Tony Wood

Yes.

 

Thank you, Emma.

And James, thank you for the question.

 

The first thing I would stress is that we're confident that our vaccine has a best-in-class profile.

And that really is anchored on the consistent high vaccine efficacy, particularly against RSV lower respiratory tract disease in the 70 to 79 population and in those with comorbidities.

 

And we know from the CDC that 94% of adults hospitalized with RSV disease are in those comorbid populations.

And just to remind you, there, we have consistent 94% vaccine efficacy across the board.

 

I'd also highlight the data that we have with flu coadmin, which serves to show no impact on efficacy of either vaccine, again, important in that population.

And the fact that we have a high vaccine efficacy against both A and B strains, with an overall vaccine efficacy of 82.6%.

 

So we're confident in our best-in-class efficacy profile.

As far as tolerability is concerned, then the data we have shows that reactogenicity is mild to moderate.

 

It resolves within 2 days.

And it's entirely consistent with the level of reactogenicity that is seen for a majority of adult vaccines.

 

Emma, I'll leave it there in terms of the RSV answer.



Luke Miels

Sure.

 

And I think just to build on Tony's point, I mean I would expect at this point that ACIP would take a relatively conservative position, but we have until June of next year.

And as they get more evidence and more reflection, benefit from, obviously, the exchange that occurred with both companies, let's see how that position evolves.

 

We've done early market research [indiscernible] presented by both companies.

So that has actually enabled us to do some depth in terms of tracking.

 

What's interesting is in terms of , you only see 1 in 4 of their 60-plus patients is actually healthy.

So I guess, 3/4 are perceived to be unhealthy.

 

And it's in that population that you actually see the difference start to emerge in terms of perception of these 2 products for the reasons that Tony has said when you look at the efficacy.

But I think also critically, again, these are scientifically fluent individuals.

 

They're practicing doctors.

They understand confidence intervals.

 

They understand consistency, and they understand and see which of their patients go to hospital each year.

So I think that's something we can build on, and we're certainly looking forward to that scientific debate.

 

In terms of the ramp, again, there's low levels of awareness amongst potential subjects to be vaccinated.

But that will change with 2 companies, obviously, vigorously explaining that.

 

I think some of the press coverage around the results is a good indication of that.

Physicians obviously are aware that there's been no solution beyond antibodies in kids.

 

So we expect this understanding will grow.

But the ramp will be more consistent and steady over time.

 

I think the Inflation Reduction Act will also help in terms of co-pay reduction, in terms of a single-digit effect, in terms of willingness to get vaccinated.

So there's a build over time, but I think it's exciting.

 

And I can imagine this is a class of vaccine that's going to grow over the next 15 years consistently year-on-year globally.



Emma Walmsley

Great.

 

Thanks, Luke.

And then I don't know if -- Tony, would you just want to give a very quick view to James' second part of the question on the sort of shift in the portfolio and your priorities there?

 

And then we'll move on because we've a long queue of questions.



Tony Wood

Yes.

 

So look, I mean, this is really for me about a focus on allocation of capital where we see data driving the potential for meaningfully different contribution to standard of care.

And I would point to the RSV results we've just been discussing, the emerging profile we have for bepi and, of course, the exciting opportunity we have within the pneumococcal vaccine opportunity based on the Affinivax acquisition.

 

I expect momentum to continue in that part of the portfolio.

And that's why you see that 2/3 of our development portfolio is now coming from infectious disease and vaccines.

 
Operator

Our second question comes from Simon Baker from Redburn.

 



Simon Baker

On COVID in two parts, if I may, please.

 

Firstly, one for Deborah and for Luke, if you could just give us an update on where we are in terms of treatment and diagnosis rates across the key therapeutic areas at this stage in the endemic phase.

And then on Xevudy, it was a very strong performance in the third quarter in contrast to a number of other antibodies in the space.

 

So I just wonder, Tony, if you could update us on the data on efficacy that you have for the latest circulating variant of the Omicron variant.

And set against that, you appear to be indicating Q4 sales for Xevudy of close to nothing.

 

I just wondered if you could explain what that was, whether there were orders for Q4 that essentially came into Q3.

Just a little bit of color on that would be very helpful.

 



Emma Walmsley

Sure.

 

Well, Simon, look, I'll come to Luke first to give you a shape of the Xevudy business, what's happened and what we don't expect ahead.

And I think you were asking for commentary from Deborah also.

 

Maybe Luke, you can add to that, what's happening in the overall market in the context of COVID, and we know that that's hit a few areas.

And Debbie, you might give a sentence on HIV.

 

And then if there's anything further to add, Tony, on variant switches as this becomes more endemic.

Then we should have that at the end.

 

But Luke, first to you.



Luke Miels

Sure, I'll take them.

 

I mean Tony will cover the debate about in vitro versus in vivo activity.

But our feedback from physicians actually using the infusion is they still see activity.

 

And so we are still seeing volumes employed and, in some markets, actually [indiscernible].

Now in terms of extra orders, we're not expecting any in Q4 because governments have stockpiles.

 

The shelf life is 2 years.

We're working to extend it to 4 years.

 

So we see it essentially as a saturated market at this point unless there's evolution of the variant.

In terms of impact on other areas, I mean, the primary area of suppression remains the ovarian cancer diagnosis, surgery and treatment.

 

It's still down by about 9%.

And some signs of recovery but still suppressed.

 

The rest of the markets, with the exception of China, are essentially starting to revert to the mean, which is encouraging and gives us confidence in terms of the outlook.



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Luke.

 

Deborah, any...



Deborah Waterhouse

Yes.

 

So in terms of the HIV market, so the overall TRx market in both Europe and returned to prepandemic levels and is growing between 1% and 2% overall.

If we look at the dynamic part of the market, in Europe, you can see that the dynamic part of the market is pretty much back to where it was pre-COVID.

 

In the U.S., the NBRx is weekly.

We're around 5,500 to 6,000 prepandemic.

 

They seem to have settled now at about 4,500 per week.

So suppressed versus where we were before the COVID pandemic, but I do think this is probably where they've settled.

 

So a slightly less dynamic market.

And obviously, we work very hard to create that dynamism with our new portfolio of medicines, which, as you can see, are being very well accepted and have a rapid uptake, both in Europe and in the U.S.

 



Emma Walmsley

Great.

 

Thanks.

Tony, anything to add, just on variants?

 



Tony Wood

Yes.

 

Just a quick one.

The latest real-world evidence from an independent group demonstrates clinical effectiveness of Xevudy through the BA.2 wave, which we believe can be extrapolated to BA.5, which is the currently dominant global subvariant.

 

That's all I have to add.



Emma Walmsley

Okay.

 

Well, I mean, I think just to remind everybody -- I think everyone knows, that no -- that COVID solutions is completely excluded from our guidance in this year and in our 5-year outlook.

We've been very proud to contribute billions but mainly the impact for health care through -- and primarily through the pandemic.

 

We're still watching to see what happens endemically.

We've got our platform in mRNA, including potentially there, but the world has plenty of COVID vaccines.

 

So this is not at the core of our development plans going forward.
Operator

Our next question comes from Richard Parkes from BNP Paribas Exane.

 



Richard Parkes

Got a question for Tony.

 

Just wondered if he could discuss his thoughts on R&D capital allocation in oncology R&D going forward.

There's been quite a lot of focus on rebuilding Glaxo -- GSK's presence there over recent years.

 

But it sounds like investment is going to be a bit more selective going forward.

I don't know whether I'm interpreting that correctly.

 

But maybe you could just discuss what you think GSK needs in order to compete effectively in oncology, whether it be in terms of technology or capabilities, and how you'd achieve that over time rather than just fully deinvesting.



Emma Walmsley

Great.

 

Thanks.

And just as a reminder, we'll come to Tony, and then maybe, Luke, you might want to add something commercially.

 

But our priority has consistently been to grow GSK through innovation in Vaccines and Specialty Medicines.

As Tony did say, 2/3 of the pipeline are in infectious diseases and in HIV, but we see oncology as part of what will drive growth at the end of the decade, but I'll let him comment more specifically within oncology.

 

And then Luke, you might want to add on that in terms of commercial, as I know we're excited about what momelotinib might bring next year.

So Tony, first to you.

 



Tony Wood

Thanks, Emma.

 

So we're committed to oncology because of persisting medical need and scientific opportunity.

And for us really, oncology is in emerging therapeutic area.

 

So you can expect in terms of capital allocation our approach to be a pragmatic one, through careful business development, such as exemplified by the Sierra Oncology deal, and as I mentioned earlier, a focus on assets in the portfolio where we see an opportunity for a meaningful contribution to standard of care.

For example, our focus on immuno-oncology in the case of dostarlimab, where we have a number of interesting data sets starting to emerge, and in the CD226 axis, where access to CD96, PVRIG, TIGIT and other members gives us an opportunity for full blockade of that access.

 

So we will continue then to deploy our capital into oncology, driven in the data set -- driven by data, which suggest that we could expect to see meaningfully different clinical contributions.

As far as the later-stage pipeline is concerned, we're continuing to evaluate Blenrep's potential to make a difference in the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma.

 

And as I mentioned, we expect to be able to report data from D-3 before the end of the year and in DREAMM-7 and DREAMM-8 in second line in 2023.

Perhaps I'll pause there and pass over to Luke to make any additional comments.

 



Luke Miels

Sure.

 

Thanks, Tony.

I mean, I think, this theme of discipline in terms of competitive profile is something that we spend a lot of time on.

 

I think to build on Tony's point, I would direct you all to the ESMO I-O PERLA publication for the dostarlimab at the end of this year.

I think it's got a very intriguing read across the COSTAR study, where there is a chemo dostarlimab arm.

 

And then momelotinib, if you look at the awareness and early market research that we've got, it's very high.

There's clearly a lot of enthusiasm around this product.

 

And so we're excited about the filing involved with that product and the potential uptake.
Operator

The following question comes from Stephen Scala from Cowen.

 



Stephen Scala

This is a big picture question for Tony since I believe this is your first quarterly call.

 

But over the past 25 years, GSK has tried many different R&D structures and programs to infuse energy, accountability, creativity.

But other than in Vaccines and HIV, none have been particularly successful when compared to leading competitors.

 

Hal made some positive steps, but still outcomes such as otilimab have been far too frequent.

So why do you think this has been the case at GSK?

 

Without identifying the root cause, it would seem very difficult to fix.



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Steve.

 

Well, I'll let -- perhaps, Tony, we go straight to you on that.

I just would remind everybody, again, on a net basis, we are -- when we look at our outlook for growth, we're in a much better position than we were 5 years ago.

 

We did -- overall, in terms of number of approvals, I think we got to 13.

We doubled our number of late-stage assets.

 

And our current momentum as well as our prospects of growth haven't looked stronger.

Obviously, we have failures because that is the nature of the industry, and I'm really pleased that we call what we don't think we can bring meaningful differentiation.

 

But in terms of your core, big picture questions on operating model, Tony, it would be great to have your reflections at this stage on that, and I'm sure the conversation will continue on the quarters ahead.



Tony Wood

Yes.

 

Thank you, Emma.

So let me start by just reiterating that together with Hal, I was a co-architect of the strategy that focuses reiterating the term -- together with Hal, I was a co-architect of the strategy that focuses on science and technology and culture in terms of transforming our business performance.

 

And as Emma has mentioned, we have substantial momentum in that context, particularly our performance with regards to our late-stage portfolio.

Our performance of the past year is better than our past, and it's in line with our peers.

 

So what you can expect to see from me and the priorities that I've delineated is a continuing of that focus.

I might pick, in particular, on an aspect of culture associated with decision-making, and in particular, improving late-stage .

 

And there, the focus that you will see on investing capital into assets which have a meaningful opportunity to change standard of care, and that is going to continue to shape our late-stage development portfolio.

And the way that you can see it evolving today with us, greater than 60% of our assets now focus on vaccines and infectious disease.

 

So we will continue to focus them.

My priorities again, in terms of technology then, building in additional capabilities and platform technologies.

 

I would remind you that we already have a substantial suite of powerful platform technologies in vaccines.

Our adjuvant technology recently added technology for MAPS.

 

And in our medicines portfolio, the growth and effectiveness of a build-in -- build-out and capability in biologics, underscored, for example, by the performance that we demonstrated for Xevudy in bringing that monoclonal quickly to the market.

Nucala is an example of a monoclonal and leading in the IL-5 class.

 

And a growing focus now on oligonucleotides, exemplified through the bepirovirsen and other cases in our portfolio.

So I'm confident that based on our focus on science, technology and culture and a build-out in technologies, both in platform technology and data technology, you should continue to see the momentum that was built under Hal continue and accelerate.

 



Emma Walmsley

Great.

 

Thanks, Tony.

We're going to move to the next questions, and we'll try and speed through as many as we can.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from Graham Parry from Bank of America.

 



Graham Parry

Just that you gave us some interesting details on the Zantac litigation and the number of cases.

 

So I just wanted to clarify because I think there might be a bit of confusion out there that you essentially have over 110,000 claimants now.

And so 33,000 in the MDL, those are the unfiled claims, and the 77,000, those are filed claims.

 

And can you give us a feel for exactly what the proportion of those are the 5 cancers are outside the MDL?

And then secondly, on daprodustat post the data, is that something which you would consider as worth launching in dialysis-dependent only?

 

Or is that an out-licensing candidate given that GSK doesn't really have a cardiorenal franchise?

And do you think that is something on which you would be able to make an economic return on the R&D that is invested in it through an out-licensing deal?

 



Emma Walmsley

Great.

 

Thanks, Graham.

So I'm going to ask Iain, who, alongside our general counsel, both from a governance and a disclosure point of view, is on point for the Zantac work.

 

Just to reiterate, we will always prioritize patient safety.

Scientific consensus on this is clear.

 

We're vigorously defending our point, and we're focusing very much on delivering the fundamentals whilst keeping you updated.

But Iain will comment on that, and then we'll ask Luke.

 

And we were pleased with latest feedback from AdCom, but Luke, comment on plans for that.

Iain?

 



Iain Mackay

Yes.

 

Graham, thanks for the question.

So overall, if you look at where we are presently, we've got just over 4,000 cases filed across state and federal.

 

The federal cases are consolidated within that multi-district litigation in the Southern District of Florida.

At a state level, what we have seen developed over the course of the last few weeks is about 70,000 claims filed in the state of Delaware.

 

And based on the data available, a couple of things.

One, the vast majority of those claims have not been vetted at this point in time.

 

So we don't really know much about the claimants' circumstances, whether it's Rx, OTC or anything else actually about the claimants.

But what seems to be quite clear is that a significant amount, if not the majority of those, are transfers from the MDL case on the actions of the plaintiffs' lawyers to pursue 5 as opposed to 10 cancers.

 

Now clearly, what is quite important in terms of the MDL case or the Daubert hearings which took place at the end of September and beginning of October, we are hopeful of hearing Judge Rosenberg's decision either later this month or into the month of December.

And I think that's quite important in terms of informing how this case then proceeds certainly in the multi-district litigation to federal level, but certainly would also, to some degree, inform what might happen at a state level, most notably within the state of Delaware, where -- which is where the majority of the state cases are now filed.

 

In terms of the 33,000 cases sitting within the MDL, those address multiple defendants, including GSK, there are other codefendants within that case.

And again, in terms of the numbers of claimants within that class, again, that will be informed by Judge Rosenberg's decision on the Daubert hearings that we'll hopefully hear a little bit later.

 

I think the underpinning on this, Graham, is we still haven't had a single trial in this.

The first trial will -- we expect to be in California kicking off in the middle of February.

 

That addresses a single claimant's case.

And then we would expect MDL to kick off around the middle of the year and exactly how that plays out will, to a significant degree, be informed by Judge Rosenberg's decision, which we'll hopefully hear reasonably shortly.

 

So look, where we are, absolutely no change in sort of the consensus of scientific opinion in terms of no clear evidence and consistency around the connectivity or the causality rather of ranitidine in the form of cancer.

And grounded in that, the strength and confidence that gives us we'll continue to defend each case vigorously.

 

I think all I would add here is that as matters evolve in this case, we'll continue to provide timely and transparent disclosure, both in terms of the numbers and other developments.

So certainly, keep your eyes peeled for any RNSs that we might issue and, obviously, our quarterly disclosures in annual report and accounts.

 

But Graham, hopefully, that's helpful.



Emma Walmsley

Great.

 

Thanks.

Luke?

 



Luke Miels

Thanks, Emma.

 

Graham, so the short answer is yes and yes.

So if we do it ourselves, it's financially attractive.

 

We can also do it with a partner and I think make that work.

I think our preference is to do it ourselves because of the synergies with Benlysta and various other [indiscernible].

 

I mean in the U.S., we are -- if we do get dialysis, and assuming we don't have an onerous REMS program, and I think you're going to see the product evolve in 3 phases.

The first phase, which is about 9 months based on CMS cycles, is pre-TDAPA.

 

I don't think you'll see much volume at that point because you're competing with EPOs, which are embedded in the bundle.

Then the TDAPA period which will run for about 2 years, and that is essentially where the cost, of course, of the medicine is removed from the bundle.

 

And so there's a strong incentive deliberately created by CMS for the large dialysis organizations, which dominate about 80% of the market in the U.S., to utilize this drug because, of course, the allowance that they have for EPO will be removed from the bundle.

The amount they receive for the bundle will not change.

 

So there's a heavy volume incentive for them.

That period will run from -- based on our timelines, October 1, 2023 to September 31, 2025.

 

After that, when it goes back into the bundle, it's very much going to become a volume contracting game in direct competition with EPO, biosimilar EPO.

So a tougher game.

 

Now all of these elements with dialysis don't require large field forces.

This is going to be a very concentrated group of people that I could probably count on 2 hands, maybe take one of my shoes off.

 

So a very small infrastructure involved there, for what is net-net from a P&L point of view, quite an attractive asset.

For Europe, we expect to get the broader label.

 

And of course, that's more of a classical non-dialysis build profile.

But again, we can embed that with the Benlysta team.

 

And I'd just direct you towards the performance of dapro in Japan, where there's 5 HIPs.

It was not the first to launch, but has captured 60% and growing market share.

 

So we think we've got a very competitive profile versus roxadustat in Europe.
Operator

Our next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.

 



Andrew Baum

First question to Iain.

 

Iain, you and I have spoken previously about the potential for the MDL to exclude multiple expert witnesses, leading you up into including the MDL being shut down its entirety if all the experts are excluded.

Could you tell us from the background knowledge, which I'm sure your Chief Legal Counsel is aware of, any significant prior cases in drug liability litigation where the MDL has been closed that have resulted in significant settlements, including to address the plaintiffs and the state courts.

 

That's the first question.

And the second question to Tony.

 

You've taken your TIM-3 cubotumab into Phase III development on the basis of prespecified hurdles for the expansion criteria per protocol.

Could you just tell us what those expansion criteria were.

 

And when you referenced the per protocol analysis, is this relation to tax or is this just patients advancing and therefore not being able to take their drugs?



Emma Walmsley

Thanks.

 

Iain, can you take that and then...



Iain Mackay

Yes.

 

Thanks, Andrew.

Look, I think as we've talked recently on this topic, there is a range of possible outcomes that Judge Rosenberg will inform in her decision.

 

But the likelihood of it being -- all evidence being excluded and the MDL effectively stopped, we think, is probably very, very low to 0 probability.

And frankly, probably unwise of us to try and guess.

 

Rather much more wise to sit and actually await Judge Rosenberg's opinion.

In terms of precedent, there are clearly instances and other product liability cases where Daubert hearings and other forms of hearings, like the Sargon hearings in California, narrowed the scope of the possible prosecution and evidence that can be submitted both interestingly by plaintiffs and defendants lawyers.

 

So there is a range of practice in this.

I don't think we have any expectation that the MDL all evidence will be excluded when the MDL suppressed.

 

I think that would be unlikely.

But we are going to save our counsel and await to hear from Judge Rosenberg.

 

I think that's the best approach here.



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Iain.

 

Tony on [indiscernible].



Tony Wood

Yes.

 

So thank you, Andrew.

First of all, I would say I'm happy with the progression of COSTAR into Phase III on basis of the IDMC recommendation.

 

I don't want to disclose the details of our clinical trial, I'm looking forward to wait and see what the data is.
Operator

The following question comes from Keyur Parekh from Goldman Sachs.

 



Keyur Parekh

Two, if I may, please.

 

The first one, just on the kind of ramp for the RSV vaccine and how you anticipate kind of launching it U.S.

and ex U.S.

 

With Shingrix, we saw kind of a staggered launch due to supply constraints.

But just wondering kind of when you see this -- how do you see the trajectory of launch?

 

And what should we be anticipating as regards to kind of the length of time it takes before you get to kind of your peak sales outlook for the molecule?

And then separately, Tony, kind of big picture for you.

 

Again, kind of coming back to R&D and culture and organization.

What are some of the things we should expect from you that might be different to what prior GSK management have done from an R&D perspective?

 

And what's kind of your broader picture for how you would define success for GSK R&D over the next 12 to 24 months?



Emma Walmsley

Right.

 

So look, what you recognized, it's a competitive situation.

Over to you first on RSV [indiscernible].

 



Iain Mackay

Sure.

 

Thanks, Keyur.

We have no supply constraints within reason.

 

So unlike Shingrix, where a delivery decision was made to impair launches to direct supply to the U.S.

in earlier launch markets, we will go for a full global launch.

 

There is some gating, of course, just from a resource point of view.

The ramp, I would expect to be quite steady.

 

It's -- the peak for the U.S.

is after 5 years.

 

Globally, it's going to be closer to 10 years just because of building the market.

But as I said, I would expect that this product grows throughout its life cycle.

 

It should just continue building and building as we see penetration in markets across the globe.



Emma Walmsley

Yes.

 

And the last point on this one is, of course, we will still see the data prove out how long the duration of efficacy is and the frequency of re-protection.

Tony.

 



Tony Wood

Yes.

 

Thank you.

So 2 points on that one.

 

First of all, I would point again to portfolio decisiveness and decision-making.

In particular, you should expect to continue to see a focus on those assets whose profile is consistent with a material contribution to standard of care, an acceleration of early-stage assets based on data and the continued focus on business development.

 

As far as impact on the broader R&D culture is concerned, then it's doubling down on technology in particular to drive performance within R&D.

And you should expect to see examples of how that technology deployment, be it against platform or data, is improving the overall characteristics of the portfolio.

 



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Tony.

 

And the measures of success, let's be clear, are the strength of the pipeline and the prospects for growth -- profitable growth it generates.

So right, next question, please.

 

By the way, our proposal is for anyone that's worried about not getting through all the questions that we will extend the call by an extra 10 minutes so we can get to everybody.

So next one, please.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from Jo Walton from Credit Suisse.

 



Jo Walton

Thank you.

 

I'll respect the one-question rule here and ask a little bit more on Shingrix.

Could you give us an idea of the level of inventory at the end of the third quarter in the U.S.?

 

I believe it was 1.9 million doses in the second quarter.

And if you can tell us a little bit about the penetration in other markets.

 

You've talked in the past about Germany and Canada as being the main 2 markets, but you're in more than 30.

So can you talk about where you've got good penetration?

 

What sort of level of annual cohort you might expect to be able to be getting to in some of these other non-U.S.

markets?

 



Emma Walmsley

Great.

 

Over to you, Luke.



Luke Miels

Sure, Jo.

 

So I mean, yes, 1.8 in Q3, which compares to 1 in Q3 last year.

But you would have seen the latest TRx as we just hit 200,000 last week.

 

So good in-market demand.

In Q3 in actual dose is about 6.3 million sold.

 

So consistent demand which is very deliberate.

We wanted to smooth the process over the year and not have it aggressively concentrated around the flu season.

 

I think we're proving to do that.

Because if you look, Q1 was 6.6, Q2 was 6.5, Q3 was 6.3.

 

In terms of outside, you saw on the slide that I presented that you've got this growing European and international presence.

And a critical point to make here, if you look at price variance globally, it's around 5% from the U.S.

 

on average.

So we've been able to preserve this pricing power so far at this point in the life cycle.

 

So German demand remains very strong.

We're starting now in Spain, Italy.

 

We're about to announce a major contract in one of the key European markets.

There are full reimbursement.

 

And so, yes, we continue to see very positive signs.

And the aim of course is to have this market completely treated with a 10-year plus and evolving efficacy before anyone else gets close to launching.

 

Now, I spent time in emerging markets in August.

It's quite encouraging what we see early days with Brazil.

 

Obviously, we don't expect to see levels of penetration that we may reach in the U.S.

over the next couple of years, but we also have the flexibility to adjust that price down in the back end of the life cycle to catch those patients who may not be seeking vaccination at this point in the out-of-pocket markets, in emerging markets as well.

 

So there's plenty of flexibility in terms of the structure and how we're positioning this vaccine for multiple year growth.
Operator

Next is Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.

 



Timothy Anderson

My question is kind of cash flows and business development.

 

So one of the challenges Glaxo faced your past is weak cash flow, limited business development activity.

That improved after spinning out consumer and cutting the dividend.

 

But I'm wondering if business development in the form of acquisitions specifically could get put on hold again, given uncertainty around Zantac.

Because it's not inconceivable that at some point, you have to take financial reserves seeing that the drug was pulled off the market.

 

So if the answer to my question is there's no change, it's business as usual, maybe you can bracket the upper end of deal sizes you'll continue to look at.



Emma Walmsley

Right.

 

Well, first of all, I want to be absolutely categorically clear.

We will, as always planned, continue to pursue business development with agility, ambition and appropriate aggression and due discipline from a financial point of view.

 

There is absolutely no change to our intentions there, as articulated also by Tony, and from a capital allocation point of view from Iain.

This is, as you rightly acknowledged, exactly why we went through significant structural reset of the balance sheet of GSK.

 

But I'd also point as to the improving operating performance generation of cash flow as well as continually competitive distribution but also some of the pay down of debt.

And of course, in brackets, we are helped by currencies.

 

And it's really important that this is understood that we are absolutely focused with support to keep prioritizing BD as part of our pipeline development mainly for continued profitable growth in the end of the decade.

We're very confident in our outlook.

 

We'll stay disciplined on it.

But that is the very clear intent and plan forward.

 

Iain, I don't know if there's anything you want to add.



Iain Mackay

I'm not sure there is much I'd actually add.

 

We've got a stronger balance sheet.

We've got strong cash flow.

 

We did a reset on the dividend, with good cover of that dividend from '23 onwards.

Strong focus on cash generation, cash management across the business.

 

And to Emma's point around business development and M&A, continued focus around there's bolt-on acquisitions of [indiscernible] that we've done over the course of the last few years.

So absolutely no change.

 

And there is not a Zantac overlay at this stage for the obvious reason that we believe there's a very strong consensus of scientific evidence supporting our position.

And we're going to -- we're going to defend our claims very vigorously in that front.

 

So absolutely no change in capital allocation priorities.

None.

 
Operator

Moving to Peter Welford from Jefferies.

 



Peter Welford

Just a point of clarification really on Zantac, which is just given the commentary you made with regards to the MDL and how Daubert decision will inform how it proceeds.

 

Just curious, is that an event that the auditors or I guess, Iain, consider then the time to consider a provision?

Or will that likely wait for the bell weather?

 

And then if I could just ask just on RSV, coming back to what Luke was saying with regards to competitive positioning.

Obviously, we've also seen data from Pfizer now and in their meningococcal vaccine.

 

I guess curious any view on that?

And particularly how that potentially could impact your positioning of the product in the retail segment in the U.S., which I think you said is very important on the prior call, given obviously that now has 2 populations potentially that could be addressed in the U.S.

 

with that vaccine.



Emma Walmsley

I suspect [indiscernible] be on the press release on Zantac, but Iain might want to add to that.

 

And then on other people's vaccines, but Luke may want to talk about the commercial prospects there.



Iain Mackay

Yes.

 

On Daubert, Peter, it informs what test [indiscernible] can be submitted in evidence both by plaintiffs and defendants' counsel and possibly the scope of the MDL that will take place in the middle of next year.

It doesn't inform anything else.

 

And therefore, viewing that as definitive.

Or it absolutely isn't definitive.

 

We have to go to court to try the case and we'll defend ourselves vigorously in that matter.

Depending on the outcome of it, then we'll consider whether or not any provisioning may be appropriate at that time.

 

But no, I don't think Daubert is an inflection point in that regard at all.



Luke Miels

Yes.

 

I think these 2 populations are going to be separated.

Again, it's going to come back to the efficacy in the group's most at risk.

 

And I think the numbers are quite illustrative, it's about 80 million people who were 60-plus who are either co-morbid or 65-plus versus the birth cohort of about 4 million in the U.S.

each year.

 

So I think it's quite manageable, and that's assuming that it's approved, of course.
Operator

Our next question comes from Kerry Holford from Berenberg.

 



Kerry Holford

My question is on your meningitis vaccine franchise.

 

So your competitive Pfizer has announced positive Phase III headlines for its bivalent vaccine and aims to file before the end of the year.

You're confirming today that your Phase III data is due by year-end.

 

If that is positive, how quickly can you move to file?

Obviously, you have more to lose in this market and Pfizer has more to gain.

 

So how comfortable are you that you can protect and indeed grow your position beyond Bexsero and Menveo.

And slightly different but related question, perhaps you can also remind me of the difference between your Generation 1 and 2 pipeline candidates in Cervarix.

 



Emma Walmsley

Well, Tony, perhaps you can comment on timing to file and Gen 1 and 2.

 

And then Luke will come to you on, I know, very strong ambitions and prospects there.



Tony Wood

Yes.

 

So thank you, Emma.

Look, as I mentioned earlier, we're confident the program is on track with regard to the data, and we're preparing to move to file post that as quickly as possible.

 



Luke Miels

Yes.

 

And I just built, in terms of the first generation asset, I think the important component is, and we published on this, is the 110 strain coverage which is -- we believe strongly in terms of provide better protection.

The generation 1 is really a U.S.-targeted vaccine.

 

We don't see the -- because in Europe, it's largely an infant population we see Bexsero being preserved and used in a mono setting.

The pentavalent is very much targeting U.S.

 

adolescents, college-age kids.

And the penetration of Bexsero in there is still relatively early days.

 

So we think the shift to the pentavalent and the better be embedded there will be a very competitive opportunity.

So it's not cannibalistic.

 

It's an opportunity to grow the aggregate business there in the U.S.

Then the Generation 2 has the potential to be utilized more broadly.

 

And then the final thing I would direct you to, which we need to build the evidence for this and ultimately find a pathway for a label, is the activity around gonorrhea.

And I think there's an excellent analogue with Merck's excellent work with Cervarix around HPV and genital warts.

 

And again, when you look at gonorrhea, I think it's about 85 million, 83 million new cases in the U.S.

every year.

 

College-age kids, of course, by nature of the lifestyle point of age at high risk.

So we think these elements combined are very compelling.

 

And that last activity around gonorrhea, we don't believe is accessible to the Pfizer meningitis vaccine.



Emma Walmsley

Great.

 

Thanks, Luke.
Operator

The following question comes from Michael Leuchten from UBS.

 



Michael Leuchten

Just a quick follow-up, just going back to Shingrix and the stocking levels.

 

I think in Q2, you were pointing out that inventory levels were running quite high.

It sounds like they still are, but you're comfortable with that going forward?

 

Or should we expect there to be a work down as we go into the flu season?



Luke Miels

Yes, Michael, comfortable.

 

I mean, they kept ordering.

And I've said this in the past, and it remains true, they order it because they're confident in using it and the script trends are certainly pointing that way.

 

And actually, we've seen a strong jump in non-retail utilization, which is not as visible to you guys.

So the volume growth are very encouraging.

 

So not concerned with the Q3 inventory level.



Emma Walmsley

We've got two more questions.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from Emmanuel Papadakis from Deutsche Bank.

 



Emmanuel Papadakis

Perhaps a question on mRNA.

 

You highlighted several times in the Q3 release the priority investment in mRNA.

And I assume that would be principally into the flu partnership and COVID partnership with [indiscernible] but perhaps you can correct if that's otherwise.

 

And are we still expecting Phase I data for both modified and unmodified through assets by the end of this year?

And what's your degree of confidence both in seeing an improved risk benefit profile relative to competitive data sets we've seen over the last 12, 18 months, particularly as regards to reactogenicity and your confidence that you've got the right external technology partner for that platform.

 

And then a very quick follow-up on royalties, if I may.

Big step up this quarter.

 

Apologies if I missed it earlier.

Is that the kind of run -- didn't seem to call out any one-off, is that the kind of run rate we should be thinking about going forward?

 



Emma Walmsley

Right.

 

Well, Iain, can you just pick up the royalties one.

And then Tony, we'll come to you on mRNA.

 



Iain Mackay

The Royalties is the principal combination of Gardasil and Biktarvy settlement.

 

Those are the 2 key elements.

And obviously, the Biktarvy settlement took effect in February of this year.

 

So we're probably hitting an appropriate run rate, but it's informed by sales of Biktarvy.



Tony Wood

Yes.

 

Thank you, Emma.

So in flu, our studies remain on track.

 

I would remind you that we have a suite of clinical studies aimed at assessing optimization of sequence and the incorporation of modified basis in both the context of COVID and in the context of flu as well as an internal build, which is continuing at pace.

So I'm confident that when you put all 3 of those together, we are well placed to be able to solve the equation associated with getting to an appropriate reactogenicity versus efficacy proposition for a multivalent flu vaccine.

 

We'll know clear how that stands, certainly by the end of the second half of next year -- sorry, the end of the first half of next year.



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Tony.

 

Okay.

Last question, please.

 
Operator

Our final question comes from Emily Field from Barclays.

 



Emily Field

Hopefully, first, it's a very quick clarification on Zantac and the impact of Daubert.

 

You mentioned that a number of these cases in Delaware where plaintiffs moving jurisdiction from the MDL to Delaware.

I was just wondering whatever comes out of Daubert, will that have any impact on any other jurisdictions like such as these state courts?

 

i.e., if cancer is reduced in the MDL via Daubert, would that then have any impact on state cases?

And then I actually just wanted to ask a question on the recent -- looks like recent decision to move the anti-TIGIT asset into Phase II.

 

If you could just comment sort of on the thinking behind that sort of as we're all awaiting the [indiscernible] updated [indiscernible] data, and it does look like an interesting trial design given that you also have a pembro arm in there sort of in the context of the PERLA study.

So just any color or commentary around that would be helpful.

 



Emma Walmsley

Right.

 

Thanks.

So Iain, swiftly on Daubert again.

 

And then Tony to finish up, please.



Iain Mackay

Sure.

 

Emily, thanks for the question.

At a state level, they're not bound by decisions at federal level.

 

And Daubert is informing the scope [indiscernible] district litigation in the Southern District of Florida.

So the states can take a different view.

 

What is interesting based on history is that Delaware has tended to follow precedents set by federal -- by federal courts.

So it is possible that the Daubert hearings would have [indiscernible] specifically related to multi-district litigation in the Southern District of Florida in federal court.

 

It is possible that the output of Daubert could also have a read across to state cases and at state level, probably notably in Delaware, where we currently have about 70,000 claims filed, of which the vast majority is yet unvetted.

So we know little about them other than the fact that they probably relate to 5 cancers that the plaintiffs [indiscernible] in the MDL decided not to pursue.

 

So that's probably all -- that's all I can add on that point at the most, Emily.

Hopefully, that's helpful.

 



Emma Walmsley

So Tony, TIGIT.

 



Tony Wood

Yes.

 

Thanks, Emily.

Obviously, TIGIT is an incredibly competitive class with more than 20 assets in development.

 

And for that reason, it's going to be important for us to move at pace since the change that you see.

It's likely that certain assets are going to have dominant positions in certain indications, given combination partners and others.

 

I don't really want to disclose about where we may compete.

But the movement that you see is consistent with that.

 

And also building out a Phase II platform capability to be able to evaluate not only doublet in the PD-1 TIGIT access, but other alternatives in combination, as I mentioned earlier, like CD96 and [indiscernible].



Emma Walmsley

Right.

 

Well, a big thank you to everybody.

I hope you got to most people's questions, we will certainly be following up in coming days.

 

We are delivering our landmark year with this another quarter of strong performance, upgraded guidance and great momentum, including on the pipeline.

So we're very much on track to meet our board ambitions for this year, for our 5-year outlook and the days of the decade ahead.

 

Thank you very much, everyone.

Speak to you soon.

 ","Operator

Good morning.

 

My name is Kevin.

And welcome to Moderna's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.

 

[Operator instructions] Please be advised that this call is being recorded.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Lavina Talukdar, Head of Investor Relations at Moderna.

 

Please proceed.



Lavina Talukdar

Thank you, Kevin.

 

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Moderna's third quarter 2022 financial results and business update.

You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we'll be reviewing by going to the investors section of our website.

 

On today's call are Stéphane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; Arpa Garay, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Jamey Mock, our Chief Financial Officer.

After prepared remarks we will take your questions through 9:15 a.m.

 

this morning.

Before we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

 

Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.

With that, I will turn the call over to Stéphane.

 



Stéphane Bancel

Thank you, Lavina.

 

Good morning or good afternoon everyone.

Welcome to our Q3 2022 Conference Call.

 

Today I will start with a quick business review of a quarter before Stephen reviews or clinical programs.

Arpa will then take you through commercial dynamic and Jamey will present financials.

 

I will then come back to close before we take your questions.

In the quarter we reported $3.4 billion in revenues.

 

We reported net income of $1 billion and cash investments totaling $17 billion.

We now expect deliveries under advanced purchase agreements in the range of $18 billion to $19 billion in 2022, due to delay deliveries from our fill-finish contract manufacturers resulting in $2 billion to $3 billion of revenue deferrals into 2023.

 

In Q3, we had to deal with lots of complexity, launching two products, mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273.214 at the same time, and also moving products from 10 dose vials to 5 dose vials.

Q3 was actually our greater delivery amount in terms of vial produced and was up about 20% the average of previous three quarters.

 

Arpa will share more thoughts on 2023 in the moment.

In the first quarter, we repurchased over seven million shares.

 

The $3 billion share repurchase program we announced in February, 2022 was completed.

Since the start of our first share repurchase program in 2021, through the end of the first quarter, we have repurchased more than 23 million shares.

 

Our first share repurchased program announced in August, 2022 for an additional $3 billion in repurchase is ongoing.

Let me now review the pipeline highlights and advances since our last update.

 

I am very pleased with the important progress the Moderna team has made on advancing the pipeline closer to product launches and at the same time equating the breadth of a pipeline.

We've continue to progress with COVID booster programs and have received for addition around the world for both COVID mRNA-1273.214 program, which targets Omicron BA.1 and 1273.224 which targets BA.4/BA.5.

 

We have, as you know, two respiratory vaccines in Phase 3 trials as we speak that continue to progress quickly.

For flu vaccine our IND in September, we announced the first Phase 3 immunogenicity study was fully enrolled.

 

We expect now data in the first quarter of 2023.

As a reminder, we plan to pursue an accelerated approval pathway for seasonal flu vaccine.

 

We also started a Phase 3 efficacy study with our flu vaccine and that trial is enrolling quickly.

For Phase 3 RSV vaccine we are on track for data without this winter season.

 

We were pleased to announce that Merck exercised the option to develop and commercialize our personalized cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157, paying Moderna $250 million in Q4.

We and Merck with share costs and profit fifty-fifty for this program moving forward.

 

We continue to expect data from our Phase 2 study for PCV in Q4 this year.

In rare diseases we are pleased to share at our R&D Day that we saw encouraging early sign of clinical benefits above PA and GSD1a and announce a new development candidate for OTC.

 

On Slide 6, you see our usual snapshot of Moderna in November, 2022 showing the breadth of the pipeline with now 48 programs in development across vaccines and therapeutics.

The company continues to grow and we have now more than 3,700 Moderna team members.

 

Last week we were very pleased to announce as a top employer by Science for the eighth consecutive year.

We have now 15 commercial subsidiaries globally and a strong balance sheet of $17 billion to fund our Company growth.

 

With this, I will now turn it to Stephen to review the pipeline.

Stephen?

 



Stephen Hoge

Thank you, Stéphane.

 

Good morning or good afternoon everyone.

This morning I'll review our clinical progress.

 

We've launched two vaccine boosters for the current fall winter season to meet different market demands and have received authorizations or approvals worldwide for these vaccines.

We previously shared that mRNA-1273.214, which targets Omicron BA.1 induce significantly higher titers than 1273 against the BA1 and BA4/5 sub-lineages in the clinical trial.

 

mRNA-1273.214 is now authorized in United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, European Union, Japan, and other countries.

For mRNA-1273.222, which targets the Omicron BA.4 BA.5 variants, the Phase 2/3 study is ongoing and we expect data later this quarter.

 

mRNA-1273.222 is authorized in the United States and now also in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, and other countries.

Now moving to Slide 9.

 

I'll review our respiratory vaccines pipeline.

I will cover the Phase 3 studies in detail in the next slide.

 

Here I want to highlight the progress in the earlier stage studies with our respiratory vaccines.

mRNA-1020, mRNA-1030 for seasonal influenza is in a Phase 1/2 study and is now fully enrolled.

 

mRNA-1345, for RSV, is in the pediatric population, is now fully enrolled in our Phase 1 study.

Moving now to our combination respiratory pipeline where we have made meaningful progress mRNA-1073, our combination vaccine for COVID and flu is in Phase 1/2, and is fully enrolled.

 

I'm very pleased to announce that our combination COVID, flu and RSV vaccine or mRNA-1230 has also started enrolling in its Phase 1/2 study.

We announced a new development candidate, mRNA-1045.

 

This one targeting combination of RSV and influenza and that has started in its Phase 1/2 study.

And lastly, in our combination vaccine pipeline, we also have a pediatric vaccine covering hMPV and PIV3.

 

That study is ongoing in a fully enrolled Phase 1B study.

Finally, our endemic human coronavirus vaccine is in pre-clinical development along with our pediatric RSV hMPV combination vaccine.

 

Now the review our Phase 3 flu and RSV programs on Slide 10.

For flu, our Phase 3 immunogenicity study in the southern hemisphere is fully enrolled with 6,000 participants with a data readout expected in the first quarter of 2023.

 

As we've previously noted, regulators have indicated support for an accelerated approval pathway for our seasonal flu vaccine candidate pending the results from this study.

We've also started enrolling our Phase 3 efficacy study in the northern hemisphere and have now enrolled more than 10,000 participants.

 

Timing of this confirmatory Phase 3 efficacy readout will be driven by flu case accruals in the study and could come as early as this winter.

Looking to RSV, our pivotal Phase 3 efficacy study in older adults has now enrolled more than 35,000 participants.

 

As we previously mentioned, our primary endpoints in this study, are safety and vaccine efficacy.

Timing of the Phase 3 efficacy readout will be driven by RSV case accruals in that study.

 

As we're now in the midst of a very strong RSV season, we continue to expect that the result will be available this winter season.

Moving on to our latent and public health vaccine portfolio, our CMV vaccine is ongoing in a Phase 3 study.

 

Our EBV vaccine to prevent infectious mononucleosis is in a Phase 1 study, while our EBV vaccine to prevent longer term sequela, such as cancer and multiple sclerosis is in preclinical.

We have two HIV Phase 1 trials ongoing and our HSV and VZV vaccines are ongoing preclinical studies.

 

Finally, our public health vaccine for Zika is ongoing in a Phase 2 trial, and our Nipah vaccine is ongoing in a Phase 1 study.

Now let's take a look at our therapeutics pipeline on Slide 12.

 

First, I want to note that AstraZeneca notified us that after a portfolio review, they are returning the rights to the IL-12 program to us.

They are concluding the Phase 1 study and we will then evaluate next steps for the program for ourselves.

 

Second, we're excited that our checkpoint vaccine has started dosing its first patients in a Phase 1 study.

And finally, our partner Vertex expects to submit an IND for our mRNA cystic fibrosis program by the end of this year.

 

We recently shared updates on our personalized cancer vaccine PA and GSD1A programs at our latest R&D Day.

And I will talk to those in more detail in the upcoming slides.

 

Now recall at R&D Day that we shared data from two rare disease programs.

The first is in our propionic acidemia program, which is a multi-dose study, and as of September, we had accrued six patient years of experience on the drug and administered well over 100 doses.

 

It is generally been well-tolerated, which is encouraging.

We've also seen an encouraging trend in the reduction of biomarkers and been observing a numerical decrease in the frequency of metabolic decompensation events, which is also really encouraging given the severity of these events for proponic acidemia patients.

 

In the GSD1A program, we shared an early set of data from the first two patients in the first cohort.

The study is a single-ascending dose study that runs a fasting challenge in a controlled and safe environment in patients with GSD1A, who are unable to normally fast or go without food for long periods of time without becoming hypoglycemic.

 

Both patients in the first cohort have demonstrated that m mRNA-3745 was well tolerated and showed an extension of fast duration and normalization of key biomarkers including glucose, which we think is very encouraging signal of activity.

To close, I wanted to remind everyone that we expect our Phase 2 results from our personalized cancer therapeutic by the end of the year.

 

The randomized study comparing PCV plus KEYTRUDA versus KEYTRUDA alone enrolled approximately 150 resected melanoma patients in a high risk of recurrence.

The primary endpoint is to prevent recurrence-free survival.

 

As Stéphane mentioned earlier, our partner Merck exercised the option to jointly develop and commercialize mRNA-4157 and we look forward to sharing that data this quarter.

With that, I will hand it over to Arpa.

 



Arpa Garay

Thank you, Stephen.

 

And good day to everyone.

I will start with a review of sales on Slide 16.

 

Sales to the U.S.

were $1 billion in the third quarter and were mainly from deliveries of mRNA-1273.222 our bivalent booster targeting Omicron BA.4 BA.5.

 

Sales to Europe of mRNA-1273.214 were also $1 billion and the rest of the world totaled $1.1 billion.

Through the first three quarters of the year, U.S.

 

sales were $3.4 billion; sales to Europe were $4.5 billion and sales to the rest of the world accounted for $5.7 billion.

In both the three and nine month periods, we saw geographical diversification of sales across these key regions.

 

We recognized there are questions regarding the 2023 market and long-term COVID booster potential and we wanted to walk you through how we are thinking about it.

As we transition into an endemic market, there are important factors we considered in our commercial outlook.

 

These include the ongoing medical need for COVID boosters and the potential size of the annual booster market.

We use the seasonal flu market to frame the opportunity and I will take you through our thinking on that in the next couple of slides.

 

I will also detail some of the factors underlying the transition to the commercial market in the U.S.

in 2023.

 

I will then wrap up the COVID section with an overview of our currently signed contracts and our outlook for additional expected contracts in 2023.

Finally, I'll close with a reminder what's coming in 2023 from our respiratory vaccine franchise, a potential launch timings that we shared recently at our R&D Day in September.

 

So starting with the medical need for COVID boosters, the chart on Slide 18 compares hospitalizations and deaths associated with the seasonal flu and COVID over a relevant time period.

For flu, we looked back at the past 10 influenza seasons in the U.S.

 

before COVID-related interventions disrupted the typical flu season.

And for COVID, we looked at hospitalizations and deaths from October 2021 to September 2022, which covers the period of widespread immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants either through vaccination or infection.

 

We believe this period is a close proxy to what population immunity to COVID could be in an endemic season.

As you can see here on the chart, hospitalizations due to COVID during the past 12 months are three times higher than the 2017, 2018 flu season, which represents a year with the highest medical burden within the 10-year period included in the analysis.

 

And the deaths due to COVID are even higher coming in at a rate of seven times higher than the same severe flu season.

This comparison shows the higher medical burden of COVID in a period that we believe more closely approximates an endemic season and underscores the need for boosters in the endemic phase.

 

It also helps frame the potential endemic annual COVID market, which I want to take you through on the next slide.

To size the endemic COVID booster market we start with the flu market volumes.

 

Volume in the annual flu market is approximately 500 million to 600 million doses around the world.

The size of the market is highly dependent on the number of doses as well as global price as shown in the sensitivity table on the left hand side of the slide.

 

The prices shown here are purely illustrative to demonstrate a range of outcomes on global pricing.

Ultimately, global price for COVID boosters will reflect sales mix and differential pricing across markets.

 

Our endemic pricing will be focused on the value that the vaccine brings to healthcare systems around the world.

As we move to an endemic market in 2023 key factors that will impact our volume in the year include the medical need, ongoing viral evolution, recommendations from public health authorities and consumer motivation to vaccinate.

 

So while we believe that volumes in the global endemic COVID market should approximate to at least 600 million doses over time, we believe it is too early to reliably predict the variables impacting the volume of doses in 2023.

Turning to Slide 20, and specifically addressing the transition to the commercial market in the U.S., we anticipate a more fragmented customer base including private payers, health plans, pharmacy chains, individual pharmacies and physician offices.

 

We also anticipate reduced predictability in orders, seasonality of deliveries similar to flu vaccine deliveries, a shift to full distribution costs assumed by Moderna, as well as other major factors in the U.S.

such as shifting to a single dose presentation and continued innovation and product differentiation.

 

Moving on to Slide 21, we summarize the contracts that have been signed so far for 2023.

We have advanced purchase agreements for the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, Taiwan and Kuwait totaling $2.5 billion.

 

Additionally, we expect deferrals of $2 billion to $3 billion from 2022.

These deferrals are from the countries listed on the slide.

 

Together, these advanced purchase agreements and deferrals total $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion in sales for 2023.

Finally, and very importantly we have a number of countries where we expect additional 2023 contracts to be signed.

 

We are working to secure 2023 orders in the U.S., EU, Japan, Australia, Asia, Latin America, and COVAX.

And we expect to have visibility into these orders as contracting seasons begins later this quarter and continuing into next year.

 

So to summarize the COVID outlook on Slide 22, with the continued higher medical burden of COVID relative to flu, we expect the endemic COVID vaccine market could be as large or larger than flu market volumes over time.

The U.S.

 

market is transitioning to a commercial market and we believe we are well-positioned to serve its evolving needs.

And finally, we have established a base of confirmed contracts of 4.5 billion to 5.5 billion in 2023, to which we anticipate adding a number of important orders in the months ahead from key markets including the U.S., EU, Japan, and others.

 

Now, before I close, I'm excited to review the formation of our respiratory vaccine franchise that we highlighted during our R&D Day in September.

As early as next year we could be expanding into flu and RSV.

 

And as we look at flu and RSV combined with COVID, they lead to more deaths annually than Alzheimer's, stroke or diabetes in developed markets.

As Steven highlighted depending on case accruals and vaccine efficacy, we could see data from our flu and RSV Phase 3 trials this winter.

 

We are actively preparing for the commercial launches for these additional respiratory vaccines and we'll leverage a COVID commercial infrastructure that we are currently building.

With that I'd like to turn it over to Jamie.

 



Jamey Mock

Thank you, Arpa, and hello everyone.

 

It's a pleasure to be here with you today.

After two months at Moderna I'm even more excited about our company's future and the role we are playing in bringing in new generation of medicines to patients.

 

For those of you whom I haven't had the pleasure of meeting yet, I look forward to working with you in the month and years ahead.

Today I will start by providing additional color on our third quarter results and capital allocation priorities and finish with the view on the key drivers on our remaining 2022 financial performance.

 

Turning now to Slide 25, total product sales in the quarter $3.1 billion decreased 35% year-over-year.

The decrease was driven by lower sales volumes due to the timing of market authorizations for our updated COVID-19 booster vaccines, and the related manufacturing ramp-up with our CMO partners.

 

As a reminder, we received the marketing authorization for the U.S.

on August 31st, for the European Union on September 2nd and Japan on September 12th.

 

We anticipate that product sales will be higher in the fourth quarter of 2022 than in the third quarter as we continue to deliver against our supply contracts for booster vaccines.

Cost of sales was 35% of product sales compared to 15% of product sales last year.

 

This includes a charge of $333 million for inventory writedowns related to excess and obsolete COVID-19 products and expense for unutilized manufacturing capacity of $209 million, and a loss on firm purchase commitments and related cancellation charges of $102 million.

These charges are driven by a shift in product demand to our Omicron targeting COVID-19 bivalent boosters and cost associated with surplus production capacity.

 

Research and development expenses were $820 million, an increase of 57% versus the prior year.

The increase in R&D spend continues to be driven by our increasing and maturing pipeline including Phase 3 studies for RSV, flu, CMV and COVID boosters.

 

Selling, general and administration expenses of $278 million increased by 65% year-over-year.

The growth in spending was driven by continued investments in personnel and outside services in support of the accelerated commercial and overall company build-out.

 

The effective tax rate of 14% compared to 6% last year.

As a reminder, we had a net operating loss carry forward of $2.3 billion at the end of 2020, which resulted in a non-recurring benefit to the reported tax rate in 2021.

 

After tax net income decreased by 69% to $1 billion, diluted EPS in Q3 2022 decreased by 67% to $2.53.

As a result of our share buyback activities, the diluted weighted average share count reduced by 22 million shares to 412 million shares as of the end of Q3 2022, compared to 434 million shares the prior year.

 

Turning now to the year-to-date financial results on Slide 26.

Total product sales for the first nine months of 2022 were $13.6 billion, an increase of 26% year-over-year.

 

The growth was mainly attributable to a favorable customer mix and higher manufacturing capacity to fulfill the customer demand.

For the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021, cost of sales was 26% of product sales compared to 16% of product sales last year.

 

The increase was driven by substantial demand reduction from COVAX.

As mentioned in our Q2 earnings call, a shift in demand to our Omicron targeting probate COVID-19 bivalent boosters and cost associated with surplus production capacity.

 

After tax net income was $6.9 billion, a decrease of 6% versus prior year.

The decrease in net income was primarily due to higher cost of sales, higher other operating expenses and a higher tax rate.

 

Diluted EPS decreased by 3% to $16.46.

Turning to cash and cash deposits on Slide 27, we ended Q3 2022 with cash and investments of $17 billion compared to $18.1 billion at the end of the second quarter.

 

The decrease reflects the share buyback in Q3 of $1 billion and a federal tax payment of $0.8 billion.

The ending balance of cash deposits for future product supply at the end of the quarter was $3.8 billion.

 

Now turning to Slide 28, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged.

Our top investment priorities has been and will continue to be reinvesting in the base business across multiple areas.

 

R&D spending was $2.1 billion in the year to-date September period, a 55% year-over-year increase.

We continue to be excited about our mRNA platform and now have 48 development programs with multiple ongoing studies in now on Phase 3.

 

We increased our year-to-date capital expenditures by 88% year-over-year to $308 million as we expand our manufacturing footprint.

We also continue to invest in our commercial and digital capabilities as well as the overall company build out.

 

Our second investment priority is to seek attractive external investment and collaboration opportunities to further expand the reach of Moderna's technologies and capabilities.

We are considering attractive opportunities that enable and complement our platform and take a disciplined approach in evaluating potential outside investments.

 

We are in multiple active discussions regarding additional external collaboration opportunities.

Then after evaluating internal and external investment opportunities, we then assess additional uses of cash.

 

In the third quarter of 2022 we repurchased 7 million shares for $1 billion.

Year-to-date through September 30th we repurchased 20 million shares for $2.9 billion.

 

In October we completed the $3 billion authorization approved in February 2022 and began to utilize the additional $3 billion August authorization.

Now it turn to our 2022 updated financial framework on Slide 29.

 

We now expect delivery in 2022 again signed advanced purchase agreements of $18 billion to $19 billion, reflecting deferrals of $2 billion to $3 billion into 2023 due to short-term supply chain supply chain constraints.

This total includes expected negative foreign exchange impacts compared to the contract value at signing, which we estimate to be approximately 1.5% of sales for the full year 2022.

 

Assuming current exchange rates remain through the year end.

Our total cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, third-party royalties as well as logistics and warehousing costs.

 

We now expect our full year 2022 reported cost of sales to be in the 26 to 28 percentage range, driven by the previously mentioned cost incurred year-to-date, a range on our Q4 volume and potentially further charges due to product updates.

For R&D and SG&A we continue to expect full year expenses to be approximately $4 billion driven by our maturing development portfolio and the global scale-up of our company.

 

Based on current tax laws we continue to expect our 2022 effective tax rates to be in the low-to-mid teens as a result of benefits from the foreign derived and tangible income driven by our international business mix and stock based compensation deduction.

Finally, regarding capital expenditures, we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $0.5 billion, slightly below the previous range of $0.6 to $0.8 billion driven by the timing of project completion.

 

This concludes my remarks concerning the financial performance, and I will turn the call back over to Stéphane.



Stéphane Bancel

Thank you Jamey, Arpa and Steven for this update.

 

Before opening to Q&A, I just want to review some of the key priorities as we close out this year and look into 2023.

For the remainder of a year we'll continue to focus on delivering our updated Omicron boosters and drive 2022 sales.

 

We are already working on 2023 sales contract; in Europe, Japan and Europe from afar around the world.

Our partner team are also setting up the U.S.

 

team and scaling it so that we can go private in the U.S.

market in 2023.

 

We continue to execute on our pipeline.

We look forward to be able to present when we have it the Phase 2 data for PCV we expected before the end of the year.

 

The team is doing a great job to cause it to enroll our Phase 3 study for flu, RSV and TMV and I'm excited to see the advancement of our rare disease programs.

Looking to next year Arpa and the team and the entire organization including manufacturing, is to bring for multiple vaccine launches in the year including commercial COVID market as well as potential for therapeutic programs to move very quickly in phase three.

 

And finally, we hope that many of you can join us next week for first ESG Day on November 10th.

The virtual event will be available from our webcast.

 

With this we'll be happy to take your question.

Operator?

 



Q - Salveen Richter

Good morning, thanks for taking my questions.

 

On pricing here for the COVID vaccine, Pfizer's guiding to price of 110 to 130 in the private market.

Is this in line with what your discussions thus far suggested, and when do you think the private market will emerge next year?

 

And then a second question here; you were talking about some of the cost burden for next year with distribution costs and building out the commercial infrastructure around flu, RSV and trials.

Could you just give us some directional color on the OpEx situation as we look – to look forward?

 



Arpa Garay

So I can take the pricing question.

 

So first I'm not in a position to comment on competitor pricing, but as we think about our pricing as we evolve from a pandemic setting to an endemic setting, the real focus for us is on ensuring that our vaccines are priced based on the value that they provide to the healthcare system and reflect the cost effectiveness guidelines that are set by public health authorities around the world.

So for here in the U.S.

 

that would be ACIP.

I think it's important to note that some of the pricing guidance that has been released in the past is really at a growth level and we do anticipate some discounting across different channels.

 

Additionally here in the United States as we evolve into the commercial setting, it's also important to remember that for all ACIP recommended vaccines there is a zero out of pocket cost for consumers.

So from a consumer access perspective, we do expect that the pricing will not be a barrier to uptake.

 



Jamey Mock

And Salveen, maybe I'll take the cost part of that.

 

So yes, our cost will change in endemic mode.

Number one, there are presentation preferences moving more to prefilled syringe and single dose files that I think will be different year-over-year.

 

We have to continue to invest in bivalent vaccines as well as Moderna will now pick-up the distribution costs moving forward, particularly in the United States.

And so yes, our cost profile will change and we'll come out and update in terms of what that means at a later date.

 



Salveen Richter

Thank you.

One moment for our next question.

 

Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.

Your line is open.

 



Matthew Harrison

Great.

 

Good morning.

Thanks for taking the question.

 

I was hoping to ask on PCV; just given that this is a Phase 2 study that's proof of concept a p-value grayer than 0.05 could be considered a success in this study.

So maybe you could just help us think about how you're thinking about success in the study and then just given that it's an open label study, how much data is available to you internally?

 

Thanks.



Stéphane Bancel

Great.

 

Thanks Matthew for the question.

So as you said it's a Phase 2 study, but it's actually a quite sizable one.

 

Its 150 patients and they were randomized two-to-one, so 100 patients have received the combination therapy in 50.

The standard of care, which in this case is KEYTRUDA, that's actually quite a sizeable sample and does allow for us to look at efficacy.

 

Now it is a Phase 2 study and so we didn't pre-specify a statistical threshold that we'd want to hit, but we are looking at hazard ratios across that and we will get p-values.

I won't comment on a specific p-value or hazard ratio at this time.

 

It's a premature to do so, but obviously we are looking against standard of care and demonstrate a significant benefit over that standard of care.

It's just important to note that the study wasn't powered for that at 150 participants.

 

And so we will be looking to that hazard ratio and the p-value as indicative.

And then depending upon the strength of that result, if it is in fact, as you said a p-value less than 0.05 and there's a very strong result we will then make our subsequent decisions about how to proceed forward with development.

 

Obviously, the stronger the benefit in terms of hazard ratio and the lower the p-value, the more we'll want to move very quickly towards advancing that program.
Operator

Thank you.

 

One moment for our next question.

Our next question comes from Edward Tenthoff with Piper Sandler.

 

Your line is open.



Edward Tenthoff

Great.

 

Thank you very much and congrats on all the progress.

Appreciate all the detail on sort of the outlook both for the COVID market and as we move forward.

 

Questions back to my favorite topic, the orphan diseases with this proof of concept I assume [ph] from the first programs, is there a desire to be expanding the pipeline similar to what you did with vaccines upon proof of concept with COVID?

Thank you very much.

 



Stéphane Bancel

Thanks Ed for the question.

 

And so I think the short version is absolutely.

In any of our modalities whether they're cancer vaccines or our infectious disease vaccines or now our orphan disease where we believe we've achieved a technological proof of concept.

 

Where we've achieved what we wanted to in patients, we look to rapidly expand the number of diseases and implications that we can bring forward that technology in.

And in the case of orphan rare diseases as we shared, we are extremely encouraged by the data across two different diseases using two different medicines that now suggest we have obviously acceptable safety and tolerability profile, which is of primary importance.

 

But more importantly for efficacy we're starting to see really encouraging results in terms of biomarkers or even from the dynamic readout, a potential of benefit for patients.

And so given the strength of those two pre prior results, we've actually moved quickly to expand our pipeline.

 

We have a number of other programs that are already publicly disclosed and moving forward in clinical trials.

Some including MMA are already in clinical studies.

 

And as I mentioned at our R&D day we're looking to substantially expand that pipeline of programs.

And so we announced the OTC program as one instance of that just a month ago but you can expect that we'll be adding substantially to that.

 

Our goal will be to more than double that pipeline in the years ahead as we expand our investments in rare diseases on the back of that de-risk clinical data.



Edward Tenthoff

Great.

 

Excellent.

Thank you, Stéphane.

 
Operator

One moment for our next question.

 

Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies.

Your line is open.

 



Michael Yee

Hi, good morning.

 

Thanks for the questions.

Maybe a question for Stéphane.

 

In RSV we've had two players read out results; I think one is 80% plus or minus 166%, plus or minus, depending on the endpoints.

So I wanted to ask you how you view the bar in terms of being competitive and where there is some differentiation opportunity for RSV vaccine that could read out soon.

 

So talk a little bit about that?

And then just as a follow-up to PCV, again just to clarify Merck had opted in; can you comment on, I guess the idea of the timing just before the data whether they had sufficient information or just talk a little bit about the implications of that opt in [ph] just before the data?

 

Thank you.



Stéphane Bancel

Good.

 

Thank you for the question, Michael.

So first on RSV, obviously we're incredibly encouraged by the results that are been seen by other vaccines.

 

Given our platform has previously demonstrated its potential in COVID specifically in respiratory vaccines, we think it bodes well for us in terms of that study.

There's a bar that's been established in terms of severe disease as you referenced in the 80% range.

 

We are looking at three-symptom or ""severe disease"".

It's hard to compare between the studies.

 

They're not conducted the exact same time and they don't always have exactly the same definition as you know.

But we would absolutely hope and expect that the type of efficacy we're going to see against severe disease will be on par with, and I would even hope for better than what's been seen by others.

 

It's certainly been the case with our platform technology compared to others in terms of COVID that we've been able to see those sorts of potential benefits.

I'll also note that we looked at titers and we previously shared our titers as well as other companies have from their early clinical Phase 1 and Phase 2 results and we believe that the boosting of anti – neutralizing RSV titers against both RSV-A and RSV-B that we were achieving was on par.

 

You could – you should – you could always argue perhaps better or worse but on par with what others had seen.

So we're quite encouraged by that.

 

And I think we're looking forward to the RSV efficacy results over this coming winter.

Our bar for this is to be good or better than others have been.

 

In terms of PCV our – in terms of PCV, Merck has opted in as you said, and I know Matthew asked the question as well.

So it is an open label study as we previously disclosed and so we have been following events through that study.

 

Those that have received the cancer vaccine in combination of KEYTRUDA versus those that have not.

And as we've now passed the one-year mark for follow-up of the last patient to be randomized in that study, we now have at least a year of follow-up and then [indiscernible] many cases, two-plus years of follow-up across those two different cohorts.

 

Those that receive combo and those receive standard care KEYTRUDA.

That data was known to us and Merck, but it's important to note that's an ongoing un-cleaned and not primary analysis.

 

And so while it is open label the correct thing to do at this point now is begin the closing process, get all of the scans, review all of the data associated with the clinical outcomes, make sure nothing was missed and in that cleaning process then finalize that database and conduct the primary analysis for the study, which is to evaluate the hazard ratio and statistical significance to that hazard ratio between the two arms.

That's actually the process we're undergoing right now.

 

And it's important that before we make a decision on whether that data is positive or negative and the strength of that positivity – how quickly we move forward per Matthew's question into whatever the next major development are that we conduct all of the right diligence on those data sets and that's the work that's ongoing right now.

So while Merck made their opt-in decision, which was really more calendar and contract driven based on obviously having access to that open label information, the really important analysis – the primary analysis, the one on which we will base our decisions of what to do next as will regulators and others is the one that we're trying to conduct right now and is not yet completed, but we do expect that result in this quarter.

 



Michael Yee

Thanks.

 

Very helpful.

Appreciate it.

 
Operator

One moment for our next question.

 

Our next question comes from Gena Wang with Barclays.

Your line is open.

 



Gena Wang

Thank you.

 

Steve, maybe just follow what you comment on Merck, just want to confirm that Merck does see in the open label data for the recurring free survival rate?

And then also wanted to confirm that the control arm, the PD1 model that will be in line with historical data that's in the low-70s that would be the rate?

 

And also how would you share the data for the PCV Phase 2 data?

Another question is regarding Slide 19, the global COVID market opportunity.

 

Since we expect significant increase in price in the U.S.

what is your expectation for the ex-U.S.

 

price change across major market since you're giving like $20 to $40 price range?



Stéphane Bancel

Gena, thanks for that question.

 

So again, it was not a continuous data set.

It was an open label study and so per our agreement with Merck they had the right to know what we know about the program at that point in which they were had to make their decision about whether to opt-in or not.

 

And so of course what we did is we provided them the access to the data of the study at that point in time and as you all have noted they elected to opt-in to that program and we are encouraged by that decision on their part.

They obviously do have a tremendous amount of experience and so in terms of the control arm you obviously have the Keynote-054 study, which is their prior registrational studies, they have experience of what to expect in a control arm.

 

And I think you can infer whatever you'd like from their decision to just say that they believe it's worth opting into that program and proceeding to the primary analysis that we're conducting right now.

We will obviously be able to compare the control arm, the 50 patients who just received KEYTRUDA as standard of care against the registrational studies that others have, and actually the many years of patient experience that companies like Merck and others have, just to be confident that in fact if we are seeing a difference between and we are seeing a hazard ratio difference, that it's not a difference in terms of that control arm, which will board well because again patients were randomized in this study.

 

Now in terms of the data we'll haven't share, at this point all we'd expect to share this quarter once we've completed the analysis.

The primary analysis on efficacy and the study is just the top line data in terms of PCV, which as I mentioned previously is looking at the hazard ratio and then a characterization statistically of that.

 

In subsequent and appropriate for including meetings and otherwise we will look to then share the older data set over time.



Arpa Garay

And then I can take the pricing question.

 

Your question was primarily around ex-U.S.

pricing and our expectations.

 

A couple of factors are coming into play here.

The first is the timing of where and how quickly ex-U.S.

 

markets are going to be shifting from more of a central procurement pandemic setting to an endemic setting.

So we are looking at how different regions and countries are going to be shifting back towards a more endemic or a commercial approach.

 

When we get to that position, we will be again pricing the vaccine according to the value that it provides in different healthcare systems around the world.

And again following established systems around cost effectiveness guidelines based on the country regulations and the public health authority guidance.

 

The overall global average price we do anticipate will be largely driven by the regional mix.

So it is hard to predict what that price will end up being, but we'll continue to share more as we see evolving demand as well as evolving pricing.

 



Gena Wang

One moment for our next question.

 

Our next question comes from Tara Bancroft with Cowen.

Your line is open.

 



Tara Bancroft

Hi guys, thanks for taking the questions.

 

So is it fair to say that the 2023 signed APAs of the $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion is the floor?

And what minimum revenue do you think could be added from the geographies that you're expecting contracts from?

 

And related to this then to what extent does it include sales in the key markets that were mentioned in the press release like for example, does it include the option from the latest U.S.

agreement?

 

Thanks.



Arpa Garay

Thank you for the question.

 

So the $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion is the floor sales that we anticipate in 2023 as we already have signed APAs as well as deferrals from 2022 into 2023.

This number does not include options from the U.S.

 

government and we do anticipate additional sales coming from key markets such as the US, EU, Japan, Australia as well as regional sales in Latin America, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and COVAX.

So again to answer your question specifically, this is what we anticipate to be the floor, but still unknown in terms of the total opportunity as we evolve particularly in the U.S.

 

market into a commercial setting.
Operator

Thank you.

 

One moment for our next question.

Our next question comes from Jessica Fye J.P.

 

Morgan.

Your line is open.

 



Jessica Fye

Hey guys, good morning.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

Are the short-term supply constraints mentioned is a reason for delivery delays resolved at this point?

 

How does bivalent booster uptake so far this fall compare to your expectations?

And as it relates to China's potential orders of Western mRNA vaccines, what's your level of optimism that that could come to fruition within some reasonable time timeline, say the next year or so?

 

Thank you.



Stéphane Bancel

Sure.

 

So it’s Stéphane.

I'm going to take the first question on supply and then I'll turn to Arpa for the commercial PCs.

 

As I shared in my remarks, we actually had to deal with very complex third quarter from a manufacturing standpoint, not launching one product, but two doing this kind of in the work hard times as you are aware, we have FDA informed us at the end of June that they wanted [indiscernible] products for the U.S.

and that product was available in pharmacy label at weekend.

 

And the shift from 10 dose per vial per provide, which is what we sold with 1273.

And for a first time selling five dose per vial, basically doubling the number of vials needed, the same number of doses.

 

And so we've had quite a number of pain points with fill-finish manufacturers.

We are working through a lot of those issues.

 

A lot are solved, a lot are still being, as we speak.

There are many lessons to be learned that we are working on to put robust fixes for the end of the year, so that we are in a much better place for the fall of 2023.

 

Arpa?



Arpa Garay

Sure.

 

So the first question around vaccine uptake we are seeing some variability around the world in terms of vaccination rates with the best data thus far really coming from the U.S.

market.

 

As we look at 2022 vaccination uptake versus 2021 specifically for COVID boosters, we're actually tracking a similar pattern.

And it's a little bit early to see what November, December, and the rest of the fall and winter season will look like.

 

But the early rates in absolute terms, are fairly low.

They are tracking the trends that we expected compared to last year.

 

Around the world, we are seeing some markets with very high uptake of vaccination rates really driven by public health authorities.

And in other markets we're still looking at sort of the dynamics that have played out this year with populations have recently gotten their fourth booster in the summertime and regulatory bodies recommending that they wait a few months before they get their fifth booster.

 

So I think more to come as we continue to track around the world.

But the early signs of uptake are encouraging.

 

Your last question on China, we continue to look at the opportunities in China.

Nothing new to report here as of now, but it is certainly a key market of interest for us commercially.

 



Jessica Fye

Thank you.

 
Operator

One moment for our next question.

 

Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.

Your line is open.

 



Geoff Meacham

Good morning guys.

 

Yes, thanks for the question.

Just had a couple.

 

Just one to follow- up on your last comment.

You mentioned booster adoption has been mixed depending on geographies.

 

Is this something that Moderna expects to further invest in with regard to value of boosters, additional follow-up and studies?

That's the first question.

 

The second one, maybe more for Stéphane, the balance sheet remains pretty strong, you guys have done some buybacks, but we haven't seen sort of a cluster of acquisitions or any sort of real capital allocation yet.

Where would M&A sort of fall in your priority list with uses of cash?

 

And does that change as COVID continues to sort of wind down with regard to the revenue base 2023 over 2022 and maybe even more modest going forward.

Thank you.

 



Arpa Garay

So to the first question on if we are investing in a vaccination rates, as I shared earlier today, the medical need continues to be clear for COVID booster vaccination, especially as we compare it to the hospitalizations and deaths compared to flu.

 

So what we're really doing is partnering with governments and public health agencies to share the data that we have in terms of the ongoing medical need at a country level, as well as the value of COVID booster vaccination in their populations.

And it's this partnership with the public health authorities that's really driving increased urgency and action around vaccinations.

 

So that's our approach as we believe public health authorities are in the best position to encourage a vaccination for their populations.



Stéphane Bancel

Thanks, Arpa.

 

And on the balance sheet side, I mean, our biggest strategy as Jamey noted in his remarks, isn't changed.

As you know we are looking, and have already signed deals in terms of technology licenses and also looking at M&A.

 

As we've said before, we stay focused on nucleic acid.

We don't really think it's a good strategic use of our capital to buy small molecule asset or large molecule or cell therapy, or else we really want to stay nucleic acid.

 

The BT team is very active as Jamey knows, and this team knows they are doing a lot of work where we're doing a lot of things.

As I've said in the past, we will remain disciplined in term of understanding the risk either on the technology side, or on the biology side, understanding value.

 

We're here to create value not to manage press release.

But the team is very active.

 

We are looking at diligence on a regular basis.

But not everything that we look at comes out to be something we think we can create a lot of value with.

 

But we will continue to look and I would not be surprised if we continue to add partnerships in the monsoon quarter to come.



Geoff Meacham

Thank you guys.
Operator

One moment for our next question.

 

Our next question comes from Eliana Merle with UBS.

Your line as open.

 



Eliana Merle

Hey guys, thanks so much for taking the question.

 

Just another one on RSV.

In terms of thinking about mRNA as a vaccine modality in the context of RSV as we move beyond COVID vaccines, I guess how are you thinking about the potential for mRNA and potential advantages relative to other more traditional vaccine modalities in the context of RSV?

 

And I guess what we could learn from some of the upcoming readouts, both, I guess for the opportunity in RSV, but also what it could tell us about mRNA potential and vaccines relative to other modalities more broadly?

Thanks.

 



Stéphane Bancel

Great.

 

Well, thank you for the question.

So, first we have previously demonstrated with our platform in COVID and in fact in some recent publications, even in flu that we're we generally see a really broad based and balanced immune response.

 

So we tend to see very high T-cell and cell mediated immunity.

And I would argue some of the highest if not the always the highest antibody neutralizing titers.

 

And both of those are really important as you start talking about older adults and respiratory infections, which is probably why we tended to see higher efficacy with the mRNA platform than other approaches in that high risk population, including in COVID, over the last couple of years.

And so those features of the platform, the ability to generate really strong cell mediated immunity, boost T cells, which are important for preventing severe disease, but also pair that with achieving very high titers for a seasonal protection where again, you get high neutralizing titers, which provide a barrier to the amount of infection that you're going to get, which is really, really important for older adults because their cell-mediated responses, their innate immune system just isn't as strong, even with a great vaccine.

 

And it’s that combination that we think defines our advantage from a platform perspective and why we're so excited about developing a portfolio of respiratory vaccines across all the leading killers in that space for older adults.

And RSV just fits right into that.

 

As we all know right now, there is a huge unmet need in that space.

We are very pleased to have enrolled, fully enrolled that Phase 3 study.

 

And we were actually quite pleased with the titers and cell-mediated immunity that we saw in early development, some of which we've presented publicly.

So we're looking forward to that FC readout.

 

In terms of other approaches, let's also just celebrate that recombinant protein, and viral vector and adjuvanted approaches, have all shown really exciting progress in the last year, year and a half across a range of companies.

RSV is a huge unmet need.

 

It will take many different approaches to have an impact there.

And if anything, I think, the success of others gives us optimism that our approach is going to also be successful, but there are likely going to be many different solutions to this for older populations.

 

We do believe that our platform had an advantage.

But given the success of the other vaccines and really, I think, quite encouraging efficacy results, it's important to note that there are many good successful options out there.

 

And it may not always be possible to differentiate between them, but we hope to be in that first class.



Eliana Merle

Great.

 

Thanks.
Operator

One moment for our next question.

 

Our next question comes from Joseph Stringer with Needham, your line is open.



Joseph Stringer

Hi, good morning.

 

Thanks for taking our questions.

Just clarification on the deferrals from the 2022 contracts, that $2 billion to $3 billion, are those locked in signed APAs and they are just being deferred to 2023 or is there any optionality built into that?

 

And then the second question is just broader based pipeline.

You are expanding pipeline 48 programs, 35 clinical trials.

 

But what I was curious if you could comment on the relative mix of the pipeline respiratory vaccines, immuno-oncology, rare disease, where it stands now and how you sort of see that evolving in that relative mix of the pipeline programs over time?



Stéphane Bancel

So maybe I'll take the first one quickly.

 

So yes, those are locked in advanced purchase agreements for 2023, and so they are just shifting to the right from 2022.



Stephen Hoge

Great.

 

And on the broader question of the pipeline, as you mentioned, we've got 48 programs now multiple Phase 3s ongoing with some we hope to be quite eminent readouts.

As you look at it right now most of our late-stage pipeline is respiratory vaccines for sure.

 

Right?

We have four programs there.

 

And we expect the flu and RSV data to come up quickly.

And we will then move rapidly in respiratory into combination vaccines.

 

And so we have three adult combination vaccines in clinical studies.

We have two pediatric respiratory combination vaccines that are moving forward and that you should expect to expand into very quickly.

 

We would hope registrational studies over the coming period which will allow us to then build out what we hope will be the best respiratory portfolio both from a monovalent vaccine perspective, but most importantly from combinations against the viruses that matter in the different populations that we really want to protect, particularly older adults and the very young.

So respiratory will be a growth area for us for the near term.

 

But we will start to see some diversification.

Again, talking about the late stage, we already have a CMV Phase 3 program, which is up and running and enrolling, it has been.

 

And you should expect us in our latent virus vaccines to add additional late-stage programs.

We're quite passionate about Epstein–Barr virus, as you all know.

 

And we expect to move that in.

And so you will start to see some first diversification in terms of our latent virus portfolio, some that's already happened with CMV.

 

The couple of things that will come quickly as well are we hope that the readout from our personalized cancer vaccine therapeutic vaccine program, and it's a really a therapeutic because we are preventing cancer from recurring, but we're intervening in somebody who has got that cancer already.

And because of that, it really has a therapeutic profile to it as an intervention and that that therapeutic readout that we expect to have over the next month or so this quarter will trigger if it's successful moving into pivotal stage studies.

 

And as we all know immuno-oncology is obviously a competitive space.

It's a space where there's still substantial need to improve upon the current IO therapy, and there are many different histologies and types of cancer in which it will make sense to develop a program if we show a benefit.

 

So that expansion could happen very quickly and will be the large diversification into oncology and the therapeutic context outside of the vaccine space.

And then the last one is rare diseases, which we've spoken about.

 

We have a couple of programs that have already started to show some very encouraging results, both pharmacology and potential clinical readouts.

And as soon as we decide on doses for instance, the propionic academia program and get confident that we've got alignment with regulators on the path forward for that program, you should expect us to move into pivotal studies there as well.

 

And then, as I said in answering your prior question, that will not just be a one-off for us once we really believe we've got a modality, we will be bringing forward many programs in succession in parallel there.

And so as you look forward on how do we think about the diversification of the pipeline it’s a bigger question, it really is a question of time horizon.

 

Right now it's a lot of respiratory and latent very quickly though we expect to be both expanding that respiratory and expanding or moving to therapeutics, particularly cancer and rare metabolic disease.

And that could happen in quite short order based on upcoming clinical readouts.

Great.

 

Thanks for taking our questions.

One moment for our next question.

 

Our next question comes from Mani Foroohar with SVB Securities.

Your line is open.

 



Unidentified Analyst 

Hi, and good morning, this is [indiscernible] for Mani Foroohar.

 

I just have a question related to volume to be expected.

So I know that your volume production, you had mentioned that you would exclude 2023 based on because of the variability there, but I was wondering for 2023, how much of COVID volumes or I would say probably [indiscernible] do you anticipate to be driven by the APAs?

 

And also as you move to our northern endemic model for locally vaccine, do you continue to anticipate APAs in the future?

Thank you.

 



Arpa Garay

Sure.

 

Thank you for that question.

As I outlined in terms of the volume expectations for next year outside of the signed APAs, we are looking at a number of variables that could impact the total volume.

 

So in the long term, we do believe we should approach a 500 to 600 million volume comparable to the flu volumes that exist today.

In 2023, there will be a range depending on the viral evolution, the ongoing medical need across different regions where we see public health authorities coming out with recommendations as well as just a broader consumer appetite to vaccinate.

 

So the reason for the sensitivity on the volume that I shared earlier is we still have a number of variables as we're continuing to transition into an endemic stage.

And so in the short term we don't have a clear picture of that total volume and what that could look like, but we do believe from a medical perspective, over time, we should be approaching at least the same volumes as the flu market.

Jim Farley

Thank you, Lynn.

 

Hi, everyone.

We really appreciate you being with us today.

 

We introduced the Ford+ Plan for growth and value creation two years ago, and the investment thesis had three drivers: leveraging our iconic vehicles, our strengths, both geographically and nameplates; number two, add to that, integrated hardware, software and connectivity into those vehicles; and then expand the total addressable market and unlocking value with Conquest EVs, new commercial vehicles, connected services and physical services as well as mobility.

So today, I’d like to share a progress report on Ford’s transformation, of course, update you on our autonomy strategy and our announcement and, of course, recap the quarter.

 

Our ambition to be the leader in EV is already taking shape.

In our home market, Ford Model e is now -- has now had incredible successful launch of three products.

 

They’re now in scaling F-150 Lightning, Mach-E and E-Transit, and each are attracting, interesting for us, almost all new customers.

So, this is growth.

 

We’re now the number two electric brand in the U.S., and we’re just beginning with our scaling.

Our decision to create Blue for both ICE and hybrid vehicles has focused and energized our team to leverage what we do best at Ford.

 

We have launched a string of hits that our products -- our customers not only love, but have lined up to buy, and we have so many more exciting products to come.

We have made tough capital allocation and restructuring decisions like the one today, particularly in South America and our international market groups like India and our results and cash flow, you could see in our results, have improved dramatically.

 

Our balance sheet remains strong.

We ended the quarter with nearly $50 billion in liquidity, even as we accelerate investments in connectivity and electrification.

 

And what is perhaps the biggest untold story at Ford, we’ve successfully recruited a roster of an incredible talent from some of the world’s best technology companies who are here to ship product and are supercharging our ability to design that software-defined vehicle and, of course, the software and services that go into those vehicles for the future.

At the same token and at the same time, we have still so much work ahead.

 

Clearly, we need to continue to improve our competitiveness, not just on quality, but on cost and supply chain management.

And our performance in China and Europe is not nearly as healthy as we’d like it to be.

 

I can’t overstate the sense of urgency we have to address these critical operating areas.

I look forward to updating you on future calls.

 

Now, I’d like to share an important strategic shift in our autonomous vehicle strategy.

Five years ago, we committed to invest $1 billion in Argo AI to develop autonomous Level 4 technology.

 

In 2020, we completed the transaction that resulted in Ford and VW both owning the majority of Argo at equal levels.

We still believe in Level 4 autonomy that it will have a big impact on our business of moving people.

 

We’ve learned though in our partnership with Argo and after our own internal investments, that we will have a very long road.

It’s estimated that more than $100 billion has been invested in the promise of Level 4 autonomy.

 

And yet no one has defined a profitable business model at scale.

Based on the change in this outlook and our increasing promise and focus on Level 2+ and Level 3 autonomy, we’ve decided to wind down the Argo business and impair the investment.

 

We’re working closely with Argo and VW on all the details.

But here’s what I want to focus on.

 

Advancing Level 2 hardware and software beyond what BlueCruise can do today and ultimately enabling our customers to travel in very large ODDs, or operating domains, with their eyes off the road will give them back the single most valuable commodity in our modern lives, time.

This has become mission-critical for us at Ford.

 

Ford has deployed BlueCruise on many vehicles across hundreds of thousands of Blue zone miles.

We have strong technology partners working alongside us.

 

And now, we’re going to bring in several hundred people from Argo, a brilliant collection of minds, who’ve done a great job, who have done wonderful work in the L4 space, but their job and mission now is to help us create a differentiated Level 4 BlueCruise system.

Yes, there are huge -- this is a huge addressable market and the potential for highly accretive new revenue streams tied to Level 3, but at the end of the day, this is about giving millions of people that time and eliminating the monotony of highway miles and stop-and-go traffic.

 

And as for the future of true L4 autonomy, we don’t expect there to be a sudden aha moment like we used to.

Deploying L4 broadly, perhaps the toughest technical problem of our time, will require significant breakthroughs going forward in many areas: reliable and low-cost sensing, it’s not the case today; algorithms that can operate on limited compute resources without constraining the operating time and domain of an electric vehicle; breakthroughs in neural networks that can learn to operate a car more safely than a human, even in very complex urban environments.

 

The muscles we have built with our new talent in broadly deploying a transformative Blue Cruise L3 system will ultimately be essential to the future of accessible driverless vehicles in everyday life.

What’s so exciting for me is that we are on the cusp of a transformational moment for Ford.

 

We will introduce a lineup of not first, but second cycle EVs that are not only fully software updatable and constantly improving, but they will generate an 8% plus margin, an amazing array of software-enabled services, not just BlueCruise L3, but many others, video services for software -- for safety and security, and we’re already shipping a broad range of Ford Pro productivity tools and 100% uptime services for our commercial customers.

That is a transformation for us.

 

Let me now switch to the quarter.

With Ford Model e, we’re on track to reach our annual production rate of 600,000 EVs by the end of next year and 2 million by 2026.

 

I’ll say that carefully.

There is no change to our target.

 

We’re adding shifts to the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightings as we speak, and we’re scaling production of E-Transit.

In Europe, our all-new EV manufacturing center in Cologne will finish complete -- will be complete in turning out vehicles midway through next year.

 

Our Ford Otosan JV in Turkey is not only scaling the 2-ton E-Transit, but they’re also going to be launching a brand-new product, a 1-ton E-Transit custom electric while breaking ground on a new battery plant that will supply those for those transits.

And in September, we’re starting production -- we’ve already started construction of Blue Oval City in Tennessee, where we will build a new generation EV truck and batteries.

 

And at the same time, we’ve already broken ground as well on the new BlueOval SK battery plants, plural, in Kentucky.

We’re also further strengthening Model e’s EV supply chain.

 

Our team is making great progress in securing raw materials, importantly the processing of those raw materials and the battery capacity that we need.

We expect the U.S.

 

Inflation Reduction Act to have a wide range of positive impacts for both our customers and for Ford.

What’s not yet clear is the degree to which the IRA will drive customer demand versus offsetting our EV investments in growth.

 

So, let me touch on some of the potential benefits of the IRA.

The first opportunity is our largest, the battery production tax credit of about $45 per kilowatt hour.

 

From ‘23 to ‘26, we estimate a combined available tax credit for Ford and our battery partners could total more than $7 billion with large step-up in annual credits in ‘27 as our JV battery plants ramp up to full production.

The second benefit is often overlooked.

 

I haven’t actually read any one of the media covering this, but it’s super important for Ford.

And that’s the commercial EV credit.

 

You know that Ford is the number one commercial vehicle brand in the U.S., and our commercial customers can now claim next year $7,500 per EV vehicle they buy with no restrictions on battery sourcing or manufacturing.

Our preliminary estimate is that between 55% and 65% of all of our commercial vehicle customers will qualify.

 

The third opportunity is retail.

Ford EVs and our PHEVs remain eligible for the $7,500 tax credit until guidance is issued at the end of this year.

 

Next year, we believe we’ll meet the $3,750 critical materials credit requirement on certain Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning models.

In ‘24, the rules will further restrict this critical materials credit.

 

So, we believe it’s playing -- a fairly level playing field right now for all the OEMs as our supply chains of critical material extraction and course processing in the U.S.

and FTA develops.

 

The fourth benefit centers on the funding growth in our investments, such as geothermal energy credit critical for Blue Oval City, the Department of Energy loans, grants to convert our domestic facilities to produce electric vehicles, battery plants and other EV components.

We’re exploring all these capabilities and possibilities as you can imagine.

 

Now, as you know, we shared the new electric customer standards with all of our North America dealers last month in Vegas.

That means a single, simple e-commerce platform, ultra-low vehicle-finished inventory, non-negotiated pricing and fast charges at all of our dealerships.

 

Now early response from the dealers have been very favorable.

Many are poised to invest to meet these new standards for electric vehicle customers, while other dealers will opt to specialize Ford Blue Oval or Ford Pro.

 

And there’s real rewards for going first.

Turning to Ford Blue.

 

We view this business Ford Blue as growth.

Last month, we unveiled the seventh generation Mustang.

 

We showed the all-new amazing Super Duty in Churchill Downs in Kentucky.

And there -- these are all very well-executed products with incredible technology and upgraded electrical architectures with advanced powertrains, and they really set them apart from the competition.

 

What you can’t see is what we see.

Our design studio is filled with new products and derivatives that will expand our hit franchises like F-150 and Bronco and Mustang and the new Maverick and the Explorer and the Ranger, all segments that we’re a leader among the leaders.

 

And I can’t wait to show you these new derivatives based on ICE and hybrid powertrains.

Finally, let’s talk about Pro.

 

In the U.S., customers trust us more than -- with more than 40% of the market for full-sized commercial trucks and vans.

In Europe, we’re also the number one commercial vehicle brand.

 

That’s for 7 years now, soon to be 8.

Businesses of all sizes and types are using Ford Pro’s vehicles as well as the suite of our services to lower their cost and improve their productivity.

 

Now, that includes multi-mix fleets, and fleets that are a mix of ICE and EVs.

Ford Pro has a real opportunity to grow service and parts sales by offering better experiences like mobile service.

 

We expect to have more than 1,200 mobile service units in operation globally by the end of this year, and they’re driving significant dealer parts and service revenue.

Actually, more than $10,000 per global -- per unit, service unit, per month.

 

But the real game changer for us in the Pro business, in parts and service growth, is software, software centered on productivity, telematics, security and predictive failure of all components.

In the third quarter, we saw our paid telematics for Pro grow by over 40% sequentially for the third straight quarter.

 

Our suite of Ford Pro software solutions keeps getting stronger and stronger, as we launch new offerings like Ford Pro fleet and the VIIZR field service management software.

But before I hand it over to John, let me end with this.

 

We have many challenges as a company, and we’re tackling them head-on.

That’s clear from our third quarter results.

 

At the same time, I’m so excited about the future we’re creating with Ford+.

We’re building completely new businesses with the best of Ford talent and incredibly -- incredible new talent across not just Model e, but Ford Blue and Ford Pro.

 

We’re strengthening our product portfolio across the board, building on what we think is the strongest portfolio we’ve ever had.

And we’re tracking the scale to a global run rate of 2 million EVs a year by 2026, and we’re investing in growth.

 

Taken together, this work statement is nothing short of refounding one of the world’s most iconic companies to compete and win in a brand-new era.

There’s no holding back.

 

There’s no looking back.

There’s no slowing down.

 

In fact, we’re accelerating our transformation.

John?

 



John Lawler

Thanks, Jim.

 

So, when I look at the quarter and our performance year-to-date, I actually see some real promises.

First, our strategic actions to segment and stand out three distinct businesses, Ford Model e, Ford Blue and Ford Pro, while complete yet, is truly transformational and is already changing how we manage the business.

 

So, it’s about more than just accelerating profitable growth, it’s also about how we are going to do that by orienting everything around our different types of customers.

The separation of these businesses is revealing to the entire organization how deeply rooted complexity is in our legacy business and how this disadvantages us in quality, innovation, customer satisfaction and ultimately, cost and efficiency.

 

And we see it everywhere, from design, to engineering, to manufacturing and how we interact with each other and our suppliers.

And so, to me, this is really exciting.

 

We understand the magnitude of opportunity and leverage that this will provide across the entire business.

Now, we just need to deliver.

 

Second, our product portfolio has never been stronger.

Starting with our top-selling first-generation EVs like Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and E-Transit to our new models of category-leading vehicles like Mustang and Super Duty as well as popular derivatives like Raptor and Tremor.

 

These are all inspiring products that our customers love.

And finally, our capital allocation choices are really paying off.

 

Our sustainable free cash flow generation from our automotive business is improving significantly, even as we accelerate investments in electrification and connectivity.

And this improvement reflects the tough choices that we have made to focus on our strengths, hone our footprint and our product portfolio, especially outside of North America.

 

So, with that as a backdrop, let me turn to our financial results for the quarter.

We delivered $1.8 billion in adjusted EBIT, above the $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion guidance range we provided last month.

 

In automotive, wholesales were up 7% year-over-year.

However, EBIT was weighed down by the rich mix of 40,000 vehicles on wheels we had in inventory at the end of the quarter and about $1 billion in lump-sum supplier settlements.

 

The settlements offset costs incurred by our suppliers, partially due to inflationary impacts on labor, freight and commodities as well as higher costs because of our inconsistent production schedule, which has been disruptive for our partners.

So, providing greater certainty and schedule stability to our supply base is just one example of the many opportunities we have in front of us as we transform our global supply chain.

 

So, we’re very grateful for our suppliers’ ongoing support and the collaborative approach they are taking to address production shortfalls, while also focusing on improving the quality of the parts they ship to us.

In the quarter, we delivered $3.6 billion in free cash flow with strong cash generation by our automotive business, despite the adverse effects of the 40,000 vehicles on wheels.

 

We expect the negative working capital impact of those units to reverse in the fourth quarter when the vehicles are completed and shipped to dealers.

Our balance sheet continues to be very healthy.

 

And we ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity of $32 billion and $49 billion, respectively.

And these numbers include our remaining stake in Rivian, which was valued at less than $1 billion at the end of the quarter.

 

Now, I’ll touch on the performance of our business units.

North America delivered $1.3 billion of EBIT and a margin of 5%.

 

Both of those measures were driven down year-over-year by higher commodity costs, inflationary pressures and a diverse mix, reflecting the buildup of vehicles on wheels and inventory.

Our brand strength and order banks remain very strong, and we expect the North American margin to return to double digits in the fourth quarter.

 

South America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts, delivering strong margins in its fifth consecutive profitable quarter.

In Europe, we posted a profit of $200 million.

 

And supply chain constraints began to ease, resulting in sequential wholesale growth of 23%.

Our commercial vehicle business continues to fortify its leadership position ending the quarter with a 15.2% share year-to-date.

 

And in China, we posted a loss of $200 million, driven by the investments we are making in electric vehicles.

Lincoln continues to be a bright spot for the region with share improving again sequentially.

 

Our International Markets Group continues to be solidly profitable.

EBIT margins were over 8%, driven by the launch of our exciting all-new Ranger.

 

And then finally, Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter with EBT of $600 million that reflected a more normalized run rate for this business.

The anticipated sequential profit decline was driven by the non-operating release of credit loss reserves and higher borrowing costs.

 

Let me now walk through our impairment of Argo.

As Jim highlighted, it’s become clear that the technology required to achieve profitable commercialization of L4 autonomy at scale is going to take much longer than we previously expected.

 

L2+ and L3 driver assist technologies have a larger addressable customer base, which will allow it to scale more quickly and profitably, and that’s going to provide accretive annuity-like revenue streams.

During the third quarter, we made the strategic decision to shift our capital spending from the L4 technology being developed by Argo to internally develop L2+/L3 technology.

 

And as a result, in the third quarter, we recorded a $2.7 billion noncash pretax impairment as a special item.

Now, let me share with you our current outlook.

 

For the year, we expect to earn about $11.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, up about 15% from 2021 with about a 10% increase in wholesales.

We’re now projecting to generate adjusted free cash flow of $9.5 billion to $10 billion.

 

Our year-over-year basis for our ‘22 adjusted EBIT target assumes significantly higher earnings in North America; aggregate profitability in the rest of the world; Ford Credit EBT at about $2.7 billion, with strong, though lower, auction values in the fourth quarter as the supply of new vehicles improves and higher borrowing costs; continued strong pent-up demand in orders for Ford’s newest products; continued strength in pricing; higher commodity and broad-based inflationary costs of about $9 billion; no further deterioration in supply chain; and continuation of a strong dollar.

So finally, before getting to your questions, let me provide a quick update on our new financial reporting.

 

Last quarter, we mentioned our plan to host a teach-in event early next year to help you prepare for this change to a radically new strategic organization ahead of our first quarter 2023 reporting.

So, we’ve now fixed the date for March.

 

At the teach-in, we will share both, 2021 and 2022 revised results to reflect our new segmentation, which we will start using for reporting purposes in Q1 of 2023.

But because this is far more than an accounting exercise, we’ll also reiterate and illustrate the business rationale for the change along with the reporting mechanics and implications for our earnings disclosures and SEC filings, and we’ll furnish you with a full toolkit to help you transition your models.

 

So, that wraps up our prepared remarks.

We’ll use the balance of the time to address what’s on your minds.

 

And thank you.

Operator, please open the line for questions.

 
Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from John Murphy with Bank of America.

 

Please go ahead.



John Murphy

Good evening, guys.

 

Thanks for all the detail.

There’s a lot of questions.

 

I’ll try to keep it to one here.

On the pivot from AV to ADAS or semiautonomous, Jim, there’s a lot of moving pieces here.

 

But there are some out there that believe they have a solution to this that’s close to working.

And I think some of us thought that Argo might be not that far behind.

 

So, I’m curious what changed.

And if you think those folks may be misguided in their assumption that they actually have a solution?

 

And sort of the corollary to that is, are you going to take this capital, and it sounds like you are going to, and accelerate your EV and your connectivity efforts that will generate profits much more quickly in the near term?

And how much profit opportunity are there, or is there, around these connected vehicles that you’re seeing with Pro that might spill over into the consumer side?

 



Jim Farley

Thank you, John.

 

The decision we made to reallocate our capital is a strategic one.

It’s some combination of the margins we’re starting to see on our software, like Ford Pro, that’s really the first large shippable software.

 

The usage patterns we’re seeing in BlueCruise, how much people use it and how passionate they are, and that’s before ICE off, the confidence we now have in delivering L2 -- Level 3; the access to public markets for Level 4 funding; the opaqueness, as John said, of the view to return capital, the invested capital in Level 4 and Level 5.

And it’s some combination of that and a few other factors.

 

But the biggest factor is our growing confidence in our talent, both the Argo talent and the team at Ford that Doug is building.

And I’m sure in the investment conference that will be a big focus of his comments.

 

It’s that combination, more than are we behind or we ahead, that informed us of this decision.

And I think it’s one of the bigger moments for us as a leadership team.

 

And we are so excited about the software we can ship to our vehicles.

We see it in BlueCruise now.

 

We see in a Ford Pro.

And we see other software that we’re in the midst of.

 

And the other key enabler is our growing confidence in landing a fully software-updatable vehicle as we launch our second cycle EVs.

John, maybe it’s best for you to talk about the reallocation of capital.

 



John Lawler

Yes.

 

So, first off, we’re not capital constrained.

We’re investing our $50 billion, and we’re investing on top of that in connectivity and software.

 

So, we ended the quarter with $32 billion of cash and $49 billion of liquidity.

So, it’s taking that investment and putting it towards a business where we think we will have a sizable return in the near term relative to one that’s going to have a long arc.

 

And that’s the business decision behind it.

So, I think we need to be very clear about that.

 

We’re going to invest in L2 and L3, and some of the savings that we have will go into that.



John Murphy

If I could just maybe just follow up on that.

 

I mean there’s got to be a high level of confidence that you’re not going to be left behind as autonomy may develop over time.

So I mean, a skeptic would say you’re throwing in the towel and you can’t keep up.

 

An optimist would say you actually have confidence that you’ll be able to keep up and maybe surpass the competition over time.

I mean, how would you couch it in that range?

 



Jim Farley

Well, I think it’s best, John, for us to hear from Doug.

 

But before we do that, I want to emphasize that a winning L4 business is as much about the go-to-market investment of a consumer-facing service.

And all the depots, all the HD mapping of all the ODs across this enormous geography, all the enormous fleet, and because it’s still weather-constrained, you have to have a driven fleet to complement it.

 

So, aside from the -- handicapping the technology, the enormous investment that will have to be made in the nontechnology pieces is a big factor in our thinking.

And Doug, maybe you could talk about how we’re -- because we’re still very excited about Level 4, how you see it as a technologist on the technology portion?

 



Doug Field

Sure, Jim.

 

As you mentioned, this is going to be a really tough problem to solve.

It’s the toughest problem of our generation.

 

And I don’t think about it as capital constraints nearly as much as talent constraints.

In the kind of projects that we are diving into at Ford and the kind of work that we’re doing, the constraint really becomes how many of the world’s best people can you get working on a problem.

 

And that’s really the decision, in many ways, that is driving what we’re doing here at Argo is we are deeply passionate about the L3 mission.

We have ideas of how it can work and how customers can interact with it that are really exciting, particularly when you add them to our next-generation EVs.

 

So, this is the way we want to use that talent.

And we think it’s the most meaningful way for them to impact the world.

 
Operator

Next question is from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo.

 

Please go ahead.



Colin Langan

Just a follow-up on the Argo, just to be clear.

 

I mean, did you look for acquirers for the business?

I mean, obviously, rather than taking a big impairment.

 

And maybe a follow-up a little bit.

What is your kind of time line for Level 4 that you’re looking at?

 

I mean, do you think this is 20 years out at this point?

I mean, I guess you had a comment with some sort of assessment before you made the decision.

 



Jim Farley

Absolutely.

 

As I mentioned, Colin, we looked at many variables, and one of them is access to public markets.

We were very clear that the Argo journey would include access to public markets over the last year.

 

And we feel like that’s a lot more challenged.

So yes, we looked at possible partnerships and funding.

 

But it was 1 of maybe 10 factors that we looked at in making this decision.

John, maybe -- why don’t you hear your -- our discussion as a leadership team on the time frame?

 



John Lawler

Yes.

 

So Colin, when we looked at this, as Jim said, not only does it require the technology breakthroughs and the capital invested in the technology, but then in all the services and fleets, scaling across the country that would be required to get to a profitable business.

We saw that five years plus the horizon being that far out before you could actually get to something that started to generate a meaningful business.

 

And we see a much greater opportunity to impact more customers immediately with the L2, L3 technology and impact our business in a positive way in the more near-term time frame.

So, that was part of the business discussion that we had with the team.

 



Colin Langan

Got it.

 

And if I just have a quick follow-up.

In terms of the guidance change, you lowered guidance at the midpoint by $500 million.

 

But you did indicate raw materials look like about a $2 billion worse headwind.

You lowered forward credit, volume guidance came down.

 

So any color on the offset to the headwinds that you outlined in the release?



John Lawler

Yes.

 

I think it’s really two things.

It’s the mix that we can see, vehicle line mix coming out of the supply base and then sterling.

 

The exposure we have, as you know, we’re the largest commercial vehicle player in Europe from a brand standpoint, and we have a very strong presence in the UK.

And so that currency change did hit us quite hard after the quarter closed.

 

And so, when we look at that, one of the things that we’ve done, Colin, that I’ve done, is I spent a lot of time -- the team has -- the last couple of weeks, doing deep dive on-site reviews of the supply base.

In fact, we’re approaching a deep review of almost 300 of those suppliers.

 

And what we’re finding is that there’s a number of non-chip suppliers that are struggling to ramp production as the chip crisis eases.

And it’s not easing tremendously, it’s easing slightly.

 

We’re starting to see that.

But then we’re seeing issues in non-chip suppliers.

 

It has to do with the tight labor market, but it also has to do refining with many of the suppliers during the COVID time frame had not invested in maintenance or in their facilities and tooling, and so they’re not able to ramp as we expected.

And that’s hit us in the fourth quarter on mix versus what we had expected.

 

And so, it’s really the mix in the currency that’s getting to us and brought us down to the low end of our range.



Colin Langan

Okay.

 

And the offset to that $2 billion in results, is that pricing and possible vehicle mix?

Sorry.

 



Jim Farley

Yes, pricing.

 

Net pricing continues to remain strong.

Exactly, pricing continues to remain strong.

 
Operator

The next question is from Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan.

 

Please go ahead.



Ryan Brinkman

Are you able to dimension for us how much of the $1 billion of higher-than-expected supplier-related inflation costs incurred in 3Q actually relate to in-period expenses incurred by suppliers versus how much might represent a catch-up of prior period cost?

 

To know that I think would help with understanding what portion of this headwind in 3Q that we should model as continuing into 2023 versus how much might be more onetime in nature?



Jim Farley

Yes.

 

So, one of the things that we’re doing is, as we’re taking settlements with the supply base, we’re looking to do that more in a lump-sum fashion, so that it’s not baked into the piece price.

And we’ll share more about what that means on a go-forward basis as we talk about ‘23 in Q4.

 

So, what we’ve provided for the year is it’s $9 billion, up from $7 billion last quarter when we reported.

The amount of $1 billion in the third quarter was part of the third quarter, but it was also a settlement for the first half as well.

 

And it largely reflects a lot of ways, a confluence of factors that led to that.

One of the things we are having better clarity around is schedule and stability.

 

And combining that with labor shortages and our high complexity, that had a larger impact on the supply base’s ability to deliver cost efficiencies this year and much higher than we expected, and quite frankly, higher than we were initially willing to accept.

And so, we spent a lot of time with our supplier partners.

 

And we came to the conclusion, and that included conversations all the way up with June with supplier CEOs.

And our conclusion coming out of that was that it became evident that we needed to increase the settlement amount, support our supplier partners, and we made the call in the third quarter.

 

And then, we told all of you as soon as we made that call.

So that we got out in front of it and knew what we knew.

 



Ryan Brinkman

Okay.

 

Very helpful.

And lastly, I think at the time of the 2Q call, you considered it a bit too early to say whether commodity costs are likely to be a tailwind or a headwind next year.

 

But with the subsequent decline now in spot prices, are you more confident that commodities are likely to be a tailwind?

And are you able to dimension at all that tailwind or maybe compare it directionally in magnitude to the headwinds that you’re likely to face when it comes to non-commodity supply chain costs which do not seem to be deflating similar to commodities?

 



Jim Farley

Yes.

 

So, we are seeing the commodity spot prices come off a bit, but quite honestly, it’s not meaningful enough at this point to make a significant impact.

I think we’re all trying to work through the macroeconomic environment how far are things going to slow down, how quickly will that drive easing of commodity prices?

 

Will that also drive ease in the whole logistics chain?

We know that logistic prices are up significantly.

 

Ocean freight is up significantly.

And so, right now, we’re trying to make that call on 2023, with a quarter left to go, is a really difficult thing to do.

 

So, we’re going to hold off on doing any of that today.

And we’ll be able to talk about more of that with our Q4 earnings at the beginning of next year.

 
Operator

The next question is from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.

 

Please go ahead.



Rod Lache

I wanted to just ask about vehicle pricing.

 

Jim, you’ve always had a pretty good read on seeing the market through the consumers’ lens.

And obviously, average transaction prices are up a lot, and now rates are going up, and trade-in values are starting to come off the peak.

 

Can you maybe just give us your thoughts about affordability and this interplay between price and volume and inventory starts to normalize?

It’d be helpful if you had any thoughts on kind of the magnitude of price normalization that we might see over the next year or two?

 



Jim Farley

Thank you, Rob.

 

The early signs are coming in.

It’s interesting.

 

It’s lumpy.

The commercial vehicle and EV demand is through the roof.

 

We’ve seen literally no -- no change, if not an increase.

And that includes commercial vehicles in Europe, which is interesting.

 

Our order bank continues to grow.

It’s multi, multi month.

 

We continue to have to close out order windows for our commercial vehicles because of the demand.

Same for EVs, as we’ve taken prices up.

 

On the retail side in the U.S., what I see that’s different from last quarter is slight uptick on 84-month customer financing, and Marion, if you want to go into that, that’s fine.

We’re seeing, obviously, an easing of used cars, which makes trade-ins, and those transactions that include trade-ins a little more challenging for customers for higher payments.

 

We’re seeing -- the one that I watch the most is our turn rates for F-150.

It’s our highest volume vehicle.

 

And we’re starting to see some differences in turn rates between XLT and Lariat.

It’s small right now, but it’s different.

 

In the past, Lariat’s turned faster than XLT, and that’s reversed compared to the quarter.

It’s really subtle right now.

 

So, what I’d expect on pricing -- and you see some of our competitors come in with higher spending now on incentives.

So, we’ve already accounted for some of that, as John has said in the past.

 

What I would be looking for and what I think is important to watch for is the mix changes.

The mixes of series and specifications within a profitable nameplate, like Super Duty or F-150 or mix shifts, obviously, between models.

 

Rod, our lineup is so fresh right now.

It’s very opaque for us.

 

So, the only mix shift we’re seeing is within spec.

Marion, do you want to mention anything about payments?

 



Marion Harris

Yes.

 

We’re seeing some customers extending terms for vehicle affordability trying to stay at the same payment level, but with higher transaction prices and higher interest rates, customers are going longer term.

And we’ve seen vehicle payment, even with that, move out quite a bit this year.

 

And it’s -- that’s starting to have a bit of an effect.

And it’s in pockets around the country as well.

 

So, many areas are still very, very strong.

In other areas, you hear about deals not going through because of changes in payment quality.

 



Rod Lache

Thanks for that.

 

And maybe just switching gears, Marion, I’m trying to understand your implicit guidance for Ford Credit.

You brought the full year down a little bit, at least it optically looks that way from around $3 billion to $2.7 billion, but now Q4 looks like it’s quite low.

 

I was wondering if you might be able to give us some color on where you expect to end the year in terms of loss reserves.

At one point, you had, I think, post-COVID, taken the reserves up to 1.2% of managed receivables.

 

Is that sort of something that you’re -- that’s implicit in these numbers, or is there anything else in there that’s driving that level of profitability?



Marion Harris

Yes.

 

Let me just give you the key takeaways here.

First of all, our balance sheet is significantly smaller than it was a few years ago, right off the top.

 

Second, we’re no longer releasing COVID-related credit loss reserves.

We’re back at what we would consider normal reserve levels.

 

Third, our lease depreciation tailwinds are mostly behind us, and we have lower used car values as we look forward.

And fourth, our borrowing costs are higher, which we haven’t been able to fully pass on to customers as rates have risen rapidly.

 

That’s something, though that over time, we do expect the balance sheet to grow, and we would expect some continued borrowing cost headwinds, but those will moderate and ease over time as the portfolio returns.
Operator

Your next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.

 

Please go ahead.



Mark Delaney

So maybe you could share more on the timing to bring L3 products to market?

 

And is that something you think Ford will be developing in-house perhaps with some benefit from Argo capabilities?

I was just thinking something you perhaps leverage from some of the suppliers in some of their potential input or maybe some combination?

 



Jim Farley

Thank you, Mark.

 

I think, Doug, is best suited to answer this.

All I would say is that we’re timing the arrival in line with our second cycle of EVs and a fully updatable -- software-updatable vehicle.

 

So kind of think of that ‘23 to ‘25 time frame is Ford completely refreshing its EV lineup globally, introducing fully updatable electrical architectures and in-house software development for controlling the vehicle, leveraging all of our experience of now we’ve done 5 million OTAs and on enhanced Level 2+ and Level 3 system.

Over to you, Doug.

 



Doug Field

Thanks, Jim.

 

We are not going to ignore the capabilities of suppliers that can provide value in our L3 solution.

They are great manufacturers of components of systems, such as imaging sensors and radar, and we’ll take advantage of that.

 

But we will have a core team that can integrate a system, understand its performance at the system level, and we will own the software.

It is really important that we also own the connection to these vehicles.

 

L3 is a connected technology.

So, the ability to have a pipeline that collects data and makes the system better and better, we must own that.

 

Finally, the customer experience, how the customer moves in and out of autonomous operation, that’s a problem that actually doesn’t exist in L4 and is a huge opportunity for us to create a Ford experience that’s really unique.

So, those are the areas that we will absolutely develop great capability in-house and focus on in the L3 development.

 



Jim Farley

And we’re really excited about the Argo team helping us with that internal effort.

 



Doug Field

Yes, we have just incredible talent.

 



Mark Delaney

That’s quite helpful.

 

Thank you.

And one more on EVs, if I could, please.

 

You mentioned the myriad of ways that the IRA could potentially benefit Ford.

And you reiterated the capacity ramp targets through 2026, I believe.

 

But do you think over the longer term and perhaps out over the next 10 years or so, does the IRA change the gross amount of investment you want to make into EVs and how quickly Ford may shift toward EVs, especially in the latter part of this decade?

Thanks.

 



Jim Farley

It only accelerates what we’re going to do, for sure.

 

And what’s exciting for us is being a 40% player in the U.S.

and the top brand in Europe of commercial vehicles in the U.S.

 

I mean, we never had this before.

And to give you a sense of the EV tax credit for commercial, how evocative that is for Ford, the people who buy a police vehicle, so people who buy ambulances for communities, the emergency responders, they never had tax credits.

 

They are going to have -- this is not just a $7,500 tax credit for consumers.

This is for businesses, including local municipalities.

 

So, I think this will have a dramatic impact on the adoption of EV, which we’re already 90% market share in the e-van business.

We think we’ll really accelerate the demand for these commercial EVs, and that’s only going to accelerate our speed to market and our scaling of those vehicles.

 

We can’t wait to show you the vehicles themselves because they’re second-generation commercial EVs.

So, this is going to accelerate.

 

What’s not clear yet, I said, is will the consumer demand side of this legislation be the largest benefit to our customers in the company, or it would be more like the industrialization of vehicles?

That’s something to play out in the marketplace.

 

And it’s hard to handicap that, honestly.
Operator

The next question is from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.

 

Please go ahead.



Joseph Spak

Maybe, Jim, just picking up there on the IRA side, you mentioned the $7 billion between Ford and the partners.

 

I believe that is sort of that full $45.

Can we just drill down a little bit because it would seem to me like you should at least be able to get the 10 for the pack starting next year?

 

And then, where are you in sort of negotiating maybe how much of that 35 you can get from some of your partners?

And then, just on the commercial side, like, should we really think -- how should we think about, I guess, the mix of EVs next year between commercial and retail?

 

Because it seems like it’s, to your point, pretty skewed in one direction.



Jim Farley

Yes.

 

Well, I wish we could go into the commercial negotiation with our battery partners, but I’m not going to go into it now.

But you can imagine there’s lots of interesting discussions going on right now between, because we’re obviously in the middle -- I mean, some -- we’ve already inked a deal on our DAs, others are still in the mix.

 

So, I wish I could cover that with you right now, but I don’t think that would be fair to our battery partners to go public with -- with how that’s going to benefit both of us.

But you can imagine.

 

I mean, I just think of it, generally speaking, as proportional to our investments.

On the commercial EV, I have to say, the demand for the move to electric on our commercial customers is, in many ways, more robust than the retail side, even though we’re completely sold out in both, for the three products, the turn rates are just enormous, the order rates.

 

But the profitability is different between a commercial EV and a retail EV.

And we’re going to be breaking out our EV business and profitability soon.

 

So this is going to be quite interesting for all of you and for us as we do that.

So -- but I will tell you, this is a big help.

 

This will really help the profitability of our commercial vehicle that are EV.

And I think it will really stimulate the demand.

 

The tricky part for us is, operationally, what do we do between now and the end of the year.

That’s the tricky part for us operationally, is we have a lot of customers who are going to wait until next year to order a Lightning Pro or an E-Transit.

 

But, I think for sure, this is just going to upset that equilibrium.

We have to -- by the way, we have to -- we have this discussion inside the Company every day.

 

How many Lighting Pros do we want to make and how many Lightning retail F-150 EVs do we want to make?

So, it’s already quite spirited discussion.

 

But I think this will help our profitability quite a bit even next year, which you will see.

And we’re really excited about this change.

 

I mean, having almost 65% of our customers qualify, including local municipalities, it’s a game-changer for our demand.

John, anything you want to divulge about the negotiations?

 



John Lawler

Not about the negotiations.

 

Thanks, Jim.



Jim Farley

Okay.

 



Joseph Spak

Maybe just -- Jim, you’ve clearly shown since you’ve -- since you’ve been CEO that you’ve been willing to adapt and change to new information and circumstances, like the Argo announcements today, I think, and the other example would be, I guess, the LFP strategy you talked about earlier this summer.

 

But I guess that has even maybe potentially changed a little bit again since, I guess, geopolitically, the U.S.

relationship with China might have turned south.

 

So, any update on that?

And is there a backup plan?

 

Is there any risk to any of those time lines?



Jim Farley

That is a very good question.

 

So, obviously, we have this unique profile as a commercial company in EV, and we now have, I mean, literally all the commercial pickup truck business that’s EV, and we’re 90% plus on the van side.

So, it’s a very important question for us.

 

And we also think for affordability, back to Rod’s point, LFP is a very important technology, and all the IP is in China.

So, this is a really dynamic situation.

 

I think what you’ll see is that the tariff rules of the importing LFP batteries into the U.S.

is still very favorable, so.

 

And we have a really great contract with a particular LFP supplier to incorporate those batteries next year.

So, I think, we’re in really good shape.

 

The real billion-dollar question is when do you localize production of LFP in North America?

And is that in the U.S.

 

and Mexico?

And where do you build the cells versus pack?

 

And whose name is on the front of the building and all that.

And we’re not going to go into that.

 

But I will tell you that just given the reality of the tariff structure, we can import LFP from China economically now.

This concludes the Ford Motor Company third quarter 2022 earnings conference call.

 

Thank you for your participation.

You may now disconnect.

 ","Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the General Motors Company Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.

 

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.

After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.

 

We’re asking analysts to limit their questions to one and a brief follow-up.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 25, 2022.

 

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.



Ashish Kohli

Thank you, Madison, and good morning, everyone.

 

We appreciate you joining us to review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2022.

Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website.

 

We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.

Joining us today is Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; as well as Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise.

 

Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.

Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of our presentation.

 

The content of our call will be governed by this language.

And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.

 



Mary Barra

Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining the call.

 

During the third quarter, the GM team, once again, demonstrated our ability to deliver strong results while executing our growth strategy and managing multiple headwinds.

The third quarter brings our EBIT-adjusted earnings for the first nine months of the year to $10.7 billion, which keeps us on track to deliver our full year guidance.

 

We translated improved supply chain performance into another quarter of full-size pickup and full-size SUV sales leadership with very strong mix and pricing.

The Cadillac Escalade also continues to lead its segment by a wide margin.

 

Chevrolet and GMC unveiled new mid-size and heavy-duty pickups to help maintain our strong position when they launch.

And the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV are selling at record levels, thanks to their range, technology and value.

 

And in September, they outsold the Ford Mustang Mach-E more than 2:1.

BrightDrop is generating revenue in the last-mile delivery segment.

 

And later this year, CAMI Assembly is set to launch BrightDrop production, making it Canada's first large-scale EV plant.

Production will ramp up in 2023 to begin fulfilling major orders from our customers, including Walmart, FedEx and Merchants Fleet.

 

In addition, BrightDrop launched Trace Grocery eCart last month to help speed up online grocery order fulfillment, with Kroger slated to be the first customer.

And as Kyle shared last month, Cruise has begun its expansion into Austin and Phoenix and he'll share an update in a few minutes.

 

So it has been a great team effort by everyone, and I really want to thank and recognize the GM team, our suppliers and our dealers.

While the operating environment remains challenging, our team continues to adjust quickly when and where it needs to.

 

This is especially true of our supply chain and manufacturing teams.

During the quarter, we completed and shipped nearly 75% of the unfinished vehicles we held in the company inventory in June.

 

That's well ahead of the plan we shared at our last earnings call.

As we've moved through the year, we have seen gradual improvement in the supply chain, including semiconductors.

 

Short-term disruptions will continue to happen, but we're taking concrete steps to minimize them and build long-term resiliency.

This includes signing several strategic supply agreements for mature nodes where supply is most constrained.

 

We are also working directly with semiconductor suppliers, ensuring long-term forecast to increase transparency and ensure their planning cycles include our volume.

I'd also like to recognize the GM China team.

 

Despite disruptions caused by COVID lockdowns, morale is strong, and the business has returned to profitability, and they are building momentum in China's fast-growing EV market.

This includes strong sales of the Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV, which remains China's best-selling electric vehicle; the September launch of the Cadillac LYRIQ and the debut later this year of the first Buick EUV on the Ultium platform.

 

As we grow EV volumes, we continue to benefit from investments we have made in new ICE products and manufacturing capacity, especially in our truck portfolio, where we are the industry leader.

In fact, we took full-size pickup leadership from the Ford F-Series in 2020 and have held it ever since.

 

We'll press our advantage with the new 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD and GMC Sierra HD, which will be available in the first half of 2023.

The far-ranging improvements to these trucks, including redesigned interiors, enhanced trailering technology and new high-feature models like the ZR2 for Chevrolet and the Denali Ultimate for GMC, are designed to support continued strong pricing.

 

We are also launching all-new Chevrolet Colorados and GMC Canyons in the first half of 2023, which will include new premium off-road offerings.

Importantly, the launches will be accompanied by significant reductions in complexity.

 

For example, we reduced the number of cab and bed configurations from 3 to 1 to focus on the fastest turning model, and we've also reduced our engine options from 3 to 1.

Going forward, all Colorados and Canyons will be powered by the Silverado and Sierra's high output 2.7-liter turbo engine, which is a great solution for customers and our business.

 

The new engine offers more horsepower and torque than the outgoing gas powertrains, and we expect a one - to two-mile per gallon fuel economy improvement on most models.

Let's turn next to our EV supply chain and manufacturing base, where we are vertically integrating and scaling.

 

To meet strong demand, we will soon be transitioning production of the Cadillac LYRIQ and GMC HUMMER EV from using imported cells to cells produced at our Ultium Cells joint venture plant in Ohio.

At the same time, work is underway for higher production at Factory ZERO as well as volume production at CAMI Assembly in Ramos Arizpe starting in 2023 and Orion Assembly in 2024.

 

Construction is also underway on two more Ultium cell plants that will open in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

This will help us meet strong and growing demand for the GMC HUMMER EV, the Chevrolet Silverado EV and Chevrolet Equinox EV and Blazer EV, along with the GMC Sierra EV and BrightDrop vans.

 

All of our 2023 launches are progressing well.

However, due to a slightly slower launch of cell and pack production than we expected, our plan is now to produce 400,000 EVs in North America over the course of 2022, 2023 and the first half of 2024.

 

We are always gated by quality, and everything we've learned will help us scale more than -- to more than 1 million units of annual capacity in 2025 with even greater confidence.

For growth beyond 2025, we continue to secure our future with strategic supply agreements and direct investments in natural resource recovery, processing and recycling.

 

The most recent example is the strategic investment we made in Queensland Pacific Metals of Australia to secure cost-competitive nickel and cobalt.

The new clean energy tax credits of the US certainly validate our strategy, and they will be a strong tailwind to expand domestic supply chain capacity and drive EV adoption.

 

As we scale the Ultium platform, we have been very intentional to position the company for volume growth, but with flexibility, efficiency and increased EV profitability over time.

This includes fully leveraging the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV.

 

We're planning to increase Bolt production from about 44,000 vehicles in 2022 to 70,000 vehicles next year, because demand is at record levels.

We will use our industry-leading loyalty to move Bolt customers into one of our new EVs, like the Chevrolet Equinox EV for their next purchase.

 

Our Bolt EV and EUV owner base should surpass 200, 000 at the end of next year.

If we retain them at our average customer loyalty rate of 64%, that's more than 100,000 future customers for Ultium platform vehicles.

 

I believe we can do even better, because our new EVs are that good.

As I've said, customer demand is strong and growing for the LYRIQ, the HUMMER EV, the Silverado EV, the Blazer EV and the early customer and media response to the Equinox EV and the GMC Sierra EV we just unveiled have been overwhelmingly positive.

 

Electric.com wrote that affordability makes the Equinox EV a win for the company and EV buyers everywhere.

And MotorTrend said, it could be one of the first vehicles to trigger a title wave of EV demand.

 

And with the Sierra EV, GMC will be the only brand with three all-electric trucks in the market, and they are all incredibly distinctive, thanks to the flexibility of the Ultium platform.

The Sierra EV Denali's Edition 1, 400 miles of range; 350-kilowatt DC fast charging; 9,500 pounds of towing, bold styling and luxurious refinements make it unlike anything else in the market.

 

In addition, the agreement we struck with Hertz to deliver as many as 175,000 EVs over the next five years will build on this momentum.

Huge segments of the US population have never driven an EV, and renting one for personal or business travel will be far more immersive than a test drive at a dealer.

 

These customers as well as experienced EV drivers will see just how exciting and well executed our products are, and this can help increase purchase consideration and sales for GM EVs.

There have been many other exciting developments this summer and fall, and I'd like to briefly mention two that speak directly to the power of our brands and the new business opportunities ahead of us.

 

The first is the Cadillac CELESTIQ that we revealed just days ago.

It is a completely bespoke work of automotive art, built around the most advanced and innovative technology we have ever engineered.

 

Media described the CELESTIQ as the most advanced, most luxurious and one of the most important vehicles Cadillac has ever made.

But one headline really captured its essence.

 

Cadillac outrolls Rolls Royce.

The second is the growth of Super Cruise.

 

Our customers have now traveled 40 million miles with Super Cruise engaged, and the numbers are growing very quickly.

We recently doubled its road network to more than 400,000 miles of interstates and non-divided highways, making it even more valuable to customers who already have highly -- are as highly satisfied with the technology.

 

By the end of next year, it will be available on 22 models globally.

While we are expanding the competitive advantage we have in advanced driver assistance systems with Super Cruise, the Cruise team in San Francisco continues to make rapid progress in autonomous vehicles.

 

Kyle is with us, so I'd like to invite him to share an update with you.



Kyle Vogt

Thanks, Mary.

 

Overall, we remain largely on track for our goals this year, including expansion in San Francisco and the goal we announced in September, to begin commercial driverless operation in two new markets.

We've now driven well over 400,000 fully driverless miles in San Francisco and given thousands of rides to members of the public, and we expect to expand our service area and hours of operation soon.

 

We believe this is now the largest, fastest-growing and most successful commercial robotaxi service in existence and by a large margin.

We've done this while building up a solid track record around safety, especially our safety culture, which drives our decision-making and approach to responsible EV deployment.

 

Our product experience is getting better all the time, and we see this reflected in increased adoption and in many rave reviews we receive across both our ride-hail and delivery operations.

As you may recall, we plan to do early commercialization in 2021 and 2022, and we have.

 

Next year marks the beginning of our rapid scaling phase where we plan to churn through the backlog of users waiting to use our service, ramp up our operations and start to generate meaningful revenue.

As for our new markets, Austin and Phoenix, we remain on track to complete our first commercial driverless public rides and deliveries by the end of the year.

 

This will begin at limited scale initially and ramp up as we produce more vehicles.

Our current status is that our mapping systems worked as expected, and we've started supervised testing in Austin with more than a dozen vehicles.

 

As we had hoped, we're finding that most of our AV systems generalize well to new markets and for the handful of things that are unique to Austin, I've seen donkeys, petty cabs, police on horses, our continuous learning machine is able to automatically mine for these unusual things and then retrain our neural networks to better handle those situations.

The same technology is already in use in San Francisco and will be used in all other markets, so that our AV system will continuously adapt to changes that occur within that market, such as new kinds of scooters or predominance of HUMMER EVs or however else cities might change.

 

As for the industry, we're seeing increased separation between the company's operating commercial driverless services and those that are still stuck in the trough of disillusionment.

What's happening here is that the companies with the best product have pulled ahead and are accelerating.

 

The best talent follows the best products, and those people are what makes a company great.

They have a highly vested interest in identifying and moving to the clear winners, and they're good at it.

 

This virtuous cycle fuels the growth of the leaders and stunts the progress of the laggards.

And it happens not just with talent, but also with suppliers, partnerships and investors.

 

And you've seen this play out at Cruise with us pulling in timing and expanding scale, which is an anomaly in an industry that is dominated by delayed milestones and missed targets.

Thank you.

 

Back to you, Mary.



Mary Barra

Thanks, Kyle.

 

I appreciate the update and all the work the team is doing at Cruise.

So before I turn the call over to Paul, I want to encourage all of you to join our Investor Day on November 17.

 

We plan to use this time to go deeper into the second phase of our EV growth strategy.

Phase 1 was focused on technology innovation, specifically the development of our proprietary Ultium and Ultifi platforms.

 

Phase 2 is the rapid scaling of our product portfolio based on Ultium and Ultifi while leveraging ICE vehicles to maintain strong margins.

And in Phase 3, we'll drive rapid revenue and margin growth across the entire ecosystem through software-defined vehicles, crews and other initiatives to create a flat-wheel effect.

 

Phase 2 has already begun and Mark Reuss, Doug Parks, Travis Katz, Paul and I will show you how it accelerates through 2025.

We will include KPIs to help you track our EV progress, including margin improvement.

 

Then in the first half of 2023, we are playing a deep dive into our software-defined vehicle strategy to show you how we will leverage Ultifi to help expand revenue and margin.

We also plan to share new details about the expansion of Super Cruise, the launch of Ultra Cruise and other high-return technology initiatives.

 

Both events are going to be exciting and compelling.

With that said, I'll turn the call over to Paul.

 

Thank you.



Paul Jacobson

Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone.

 

Thank you for taking the time to join us.

We've stressed that this year is about executing.

 

In the beginning of the year, we highlighted $5 billion of inflation impact [ph] the business, but set out to perform at or near the record levels that we achieved in 2021.

Now that we are more than three-quarters of the way through the year, I'm extremely proud of the progress that our global team has made.

 

We remain well on our way to achieving the commitments we outlined in February.

Volumes were up 80% year-over-year as we successfully completed and shipped nearly 75% of the vehicles built without certain components held in company inventory at the end of Q2.

 

This tailwind was partially offset by logistical challenges we have seen, particularly from Mexico, which has impacted our ability to recognize revenue on certain in-transit vehicles, along with some spot plant downtime.

Overall, parts availability and supply chain issues continue to slowly trend in the right direction, with the team working tirelessly to navigate the dynamic environment.

 

As a result, we remain on track to increase full year 2022 wholesales by 25% to 30% year-over-year and delivered North American EBIT margins of 10%.

Q3 revenue of $41.9 billion was a record for the company.

 

We achieved $4.3 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 10.2% EBIT-adjusted margins and $2.25 in EPS diluted adjusted.

We generated $4.6 billion [indiscernible] cash flow during the quarter and continue to expect $7 billion to $9 billion cash flow for the full year.

 

Our strong cash generation allows us to continue investing in our future, while at the same time, returning cash to shareholders.

The confidence in our longer-term outlook informed the Board's decision in August to reinstate a corporate dividend and increase our share repurchase authorization to $5 billion.

 

During the quarter, we bought back $1.5 billion of stock, retiring 38 million shares.

North America delivered Q3 EBIT adjusted of $3.9 billion, up $1.8 billion year-over-year, and EBIT-adjusted margins of 11.2%, primarily driven by higher volume and pricing, partially offset by higher commodity costs, as well as investments in growth.

 

Q3 EBIT was positively impacted by the completion of a substantial amount of the vehicles that we built without certain components, which we said last quarter were primarily full-size trucks and SUVs.

As production improves, we're closely monitoring dealer stock and inventory turns to appropriately match supply with demand.

 

The number of vehicles physically on dealer lots is well below historical levels and continues to be tight at around 20 days.

Importantly, demand remained strong for our highest margin projects with very fast turn rates.

 

These included HD pickups, like the Sierra, which is turning in about 10 days, and our full-size SUVs are turning even faster.

Total dealer stock, including in-transit vehicles, increased due to a combination of higher production, clearing out the portion of company inventory and logistical challenges that have lengthened the [indiscernible] vehicles to arrive at dealers.

 

Pricing in Q3 was favorable versus Q2 and well above Q3 last year.

Costs were up year-over-year, primarily due to increased commodity and logistics expenses; engineering, software development costs; and the absence of a favorable Bolt recovery in the third quarter last year.

 

GM International delivered third quarter EBIT adjusted of $300 million, up $100 million year-over-year, as the team continued to navigate a volatile and dynamic environment.

This included $300 million of equity income in China, up slightly year-over-year, as production levels have continued to improve from COVID-related impacts earlier in the year.

 

EBIT-adjusted in GMI, excluding China equity income was breakeven, also up slightly year-over-year with results driven by favorable pricing and volume, partially offset by the same mix and commodity costs.

Year-to-date EBIT adjusted is $400 million, reflecting the tremendous work the team has done over the last several years to strengthen this business.

 

GM Financial once again delivered strong results with Q3 EBT adjusted of $900 million, down $200 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower net leased vehicle income.

Overall, GM Financial's balance sheet and credit metrics remain healthy, reflecting the strong underlying credit quality of the portfolio.

 

Although moderating off historically strong levels, net charge-offs remain below pre-pandemic levels as credit mix has shifted towards prime customers.

Corporate expenses were $350 million in the quarter, up $100 million year-over-year, primarily driven by growth initiatives.

 

Corporate also included $100 million gain relating to the disposition of our Stellantis warrants, which we exercised in Q3 when the lockup period expired and resulted in approximately $1.1 billion of cash proceeds.

Cruise expenses were $500 million in the quarter, up $200 million year-over-year, driven mainly by modifications to share-based awards, resulting in an accounting change in compensation expense.

 

Now let me provide a few forward-looking comments.

We continue to track to the midpoint of the $13 billion to $15 billion EBIT-adjusted range we laid out at the beginning of the year.

 

Year-to-date, we're at $10.7 billion EBIT adjusted, which implies Q4 EBIT adjusted in the low $3 billion range.

Slightly higher wholesale volumes from completing the remaining vehicles held at company inventory are expected to be more than offset by a normalizing mix, launch-related costs and typical seasonality we see in Q4.

 

We estimate commodity and logistics costs to be around $5 billion headwind year-over-year, consistent with prior expectations.

Earlier in the year, raw materials were driving around two-thirds of this $5 billion increase.

 

They have come down and are now closer to half, but this benefit has been offset by other costs such as logistics and supplier claims.

We're working collaboratively with our suppliers to jointly identify efficiencies to help mitigate these headwinds.

 

As we move into 2023, we continue to see the dynamics between commodities and pricing as a natural hedge that should trend in similar directions, helping to maintain the earnings power of the company.

We also continue to see strong demand for our products, and we'll remain thoughtful in our approach to pricing.

 

We've been agile through this volatile environment over the last couple of years.

And as we said last quarter, we're already taking proactive steps to manage costs and cash flows, including reducing some discretionary spending and limiting hiring the critical needs and positions that support growth.

 

In summary, we continue to execute on our near-term financial goals.

But more importantly, we're making great progress on the milestones we shared last year.

 

And then just -- we'll have the opportunity to update you at our Investor Day in New York on November 17.

This concludes our opening comments.

 

We'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator

Thank you.

 

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America.

John, your line is open.

 



John Murphy

Good morning guys.

 

And thanks for all the detail.

Just a first question around inventory, and I'll promise to state a one follow-up to this.

 

I mean, if we think about 359,000 of units on dealer lots right now, you're saying that's about 20 days supply.

I mean, just curious, how you think about governing that going forward, so you maintain this very strong price environment, which is driving record profitability.

 

I'm just trying to make sure we stay at tight levels.

And how do you think about staying tight to support pricing.

 



Paul Jacobson

So, Mary, I’ll take…

 



Mary Barra

Yeah.

 

Go ahead, Paul.



Paul Jacobson

Apologies.

 

Well, thanks for that question, John.

So we're watching this very, very closely as we've said, looking at dealer turn times, looking at grounded stock.

 

As we've talked about, logistics remain a bit of a challenge for us, whether it's vehicles that are completed, waiting transit to dealers, or even some vehicles that we've had some challenges getting across the next quarter from our facilities down there.

So a lot of this inventory still is in transit.

 

The grounded inventory, we continue to speak to our dealers.

They say demand is really strong, and many dealers are saying that the only time vehicle sit there when a buyer opts out of a transaction they already had.

 

And it's not very long before they go through their list and find somebody to purchase them.

So this is something that we're watching very closely.

 

I think there's a little bit of a surge right now as we complete the vehicles that were partially built at the end of June.

But we watch this.

 

We're seeing no signs of concern in the short run.



John Murphy

Okay.

 

And then, just a follow-up then on tightness.

I mean, cap U -- in the quarter, I think you said in North America is 103.3%, two shifts straight time.

 

That kind of implied capacity of about 3.1 million units.

If we look back to some period that was somewhat normal in the third quarter of 2020, it's hard to call anything the last couple of years normal, but kind of normal, that cap was 112%, and your GM&A EBIT margins were 15%, right?

 

So this quarter, we were over 11%.

I'm just curious, as you think about ramping up that cap U curve, Mary, you've been doing this for a while and understand the stuff well.

 

Is there room for margins, all else equal, as volumes recover and that cap U goes up, that you could see significant upside to margins over time?

And where does that bend backwards?

 

Is it 110%, 115%, 120% cap U?

And would you add more capacity to help alleviate that sort of backward bend?

 



Mary Barra

Well, John, I think, overall, we're going to remain disciplined.

 

I do think there's an opportunity to drive strong margins.

We're seeing it right now with the mix, for instance, on full-size trucks.

 

Consumers continue to want a very high mix.

We think that, that will translate also into EV.

 

And as we move forward in the EV launch and have our battery plants operating and get to scale and continuing to make the battery improvements, we see, again, that's another level to have strong margins.

And then sitting on top of that is, from a software perspective.

 

And then, overall, beyond, I'll say, the traditional new vehicle sales, the work that we'll have with CarBravo as well as the growth businesses around GM Defense, BrightDrop and Cruise, I think there's quite a lot of upside from a margin perspective in the company.

But to drill into the specific, we will be disciplined as possible.

 

And the reason I say as disciplined as possible, we also do have to be responsive to what the competitive environment is.

But I think we have -- I think there's -- as an industry, we've learned a lot over this last couple of years of how we can be more efficient between ourselves and the dealers and how we can make sure we're serving the customer in an efficient way.

 



John Murphy

Okay.

 

Thank you very much, guys.
Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets.

 

Joseph, your line is open.



Joseph Spak

Thanks so much.

 

Good morning everyone.

Mary or Paul, maybe you could just give a little bit more color on what's going on at the -- it sounds like the battery factories are sort of causing a slight delay there.

 

Is that sort of a timing of some equipment coming in or some extra steps in terms of making sure the quality is there?

Maybe just a little bit more color on that.

 



Mary Barra

Sure, Joe.

 

Well, one, I think we had a very aggressive launch plan when we started to build the plant.

Let's step back and recognize that the Ohio plant is the size of 30 football fields, and it will employ over 1,000 people.

 

Making sure we had all our people there and trained has taken a little longer than expected.

Also, this is the first facility that we're working with LGES, and we're working together effectively to really leverage not only the expertise that LGES has, but what GM brings.

 

And so there's no one thing, but it has just taken a little longer to make sure that we're able to produce with quality.

I'm very confident in the team and how they're working together.

 

And I think we're in that ramp, but because it's taken a little bit longer.

Also from the battery pack assembly as well, both of those, as we've ramped up are taking a little bit longer.

 

And that's why instead of hitting the 400,000 mark at the end of 2023, it's going to seep into 2024.

But with everything that we're learning, it gives me great confidence that we're going to be able to start plant two, three and beyond on time.

 

And I have greater confidence in our ability to scale to the 1 million units of annual EV capacity in 2025 in the US and similarly in China.

So it really is just that first plant up and going, recognize the size and complexity of it.

 

But I'm really proud of the team of where they're at right now.



Joseph Spak

Okay.

 

Thanks for that.

And maybe somewhat related, but Paul, I know CapEx was sort of reiterated at $9 billion to $10 billion for the year.

 

You're trending well below that through nine months.

So is that still correct?

 

I mean, is there any incentive to push some of that to next year because of maybe some of the policy changes?

And also, I guess, with the policy changes, any thoughts on if that $9 billion to $10 billion is still the right rate for the next couple of years, or are you actually incentivized to maybe try to accelerate some of that now?

 



Paul Jacobson

Well, Joe, I think when you look at our historical spend rates, we tend to have CapEx that -- it's a little bit back-loaded from that standpoint.

 

And I think we're still on track for the $9 billion to $10 billion going forward this year.

As we look at the future years, obviously, we've had some pretty steep acceleration in EV volumes, et cetera.

 

And we'll provide some more updates at Investor Day.

But I think we're well within our ability to fund our expansion, our transformation through internally generated funds when you look at the health of the business.

 

And I think when you look at cash balance, when you look at cash flows, when you look at our ability to repurchase some shares during the quarter, that signals our confidence about being able to balance the spending, be aggressive where we can, as you've seen us over the last couple of years, but also keep that balanced within our means.

And you're going to continue to see that from us.

 



Joseph Spak

Thanks very much.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.

 

Rod, your line is open.



Rod Lache

Good morning.

 

Wanted to ask first, Mary.

I overheard you say in an interview this morning that GM is well positioned for the IRA.

 

I was hoping you can give us maybe some color on the magnitude of the North America content and critical mineral sourcing or the manufacturing credits as you look out to next year?

And related to this, your original margin targets sort of mid-term and long-term, the 10% and 12% were pre-IRA.

 

And I'm curious, if you have any thoughts on whether this could be accretive to that.



Mary Barra

Sure.

 

Well, just to maybe touch on that last point.

We believe we are very well positioned.

 

And we think we're waiting for the treasury rules to be finalized, but we think it will accomplish.

So it positions us with our strong EV portfolio covering the important segments to really drive affordability to spur adoption.

 

So, overall, we feel very well positioned.

But if you look at it right now, over the 10-year life cycle of the credit, we will offer a number of models in the segments and price ranges that will be eligible for the full $7,500 credit.

 

And for us, many of these are going to be high-volume entries.

We do think some of the vehicles will be eligible for the $3,750 credits starting in January, and then we'll ramp toward full qualification across the broad portfolio in two to three years as some of the different supply comes online in North America or in the United States.

 

We also think there's a significant opportunity to potentially leverage the tax credit of up to $45 per kilowatt hour with respect to battery cells and battery modules produced in the US.

So that's another opportunity where, again, I think, we're better positioned than most because of our aggressive plan to get the battery plants and the pack assembly in this country.

 

And then, we do think we see an opportunity for our suppliers to leverage a tax credit for up to 10% of the cost of the US source battery electrode active materials, starting in January of next year.

So that's just a little bit more color.

 

Again, we'll have vehicles that are in the right MSRP range to qualify.

So when you look at it overall, there's the commercial incentives also that will support BrightDrop in the fleet and rental car.

 

There's the used EV purchase incentive that we think will support EV resell values.

And again, we have CarBravo.

 

And then the elements from a manufacturing granted loans.

So that's just a little bit of the detail.

 

Again, we're waiting for the final rules from treasury, but I think you can see this will really go a long way to helping us drive affordable EVs and drive our profitability, while even hitting some of the lower MSRPs.



Rod Lache

Thanks, Mary.

 

That's helpful.

And Paul, on your last call, you mentioned that the next recession would be characterized by risk to pricing as opposed to volume.

 

I mean, since then, rates have obviously gone up and trade-in values have moderated.

And even though you have a lot of in-transit inventory, it looks like the aggregate inventory is probably climbing in the 50 to 60-day range.

 

I was hoping, maybe, that you can give us a little bit of additional color on how you see that playing out?

Whether you think we shift from supply constraints to demand constraints or any color on this commodity hedge that you mentioned during your prepared remarks?

 



Paul Jacobson

Yes.

 

Thanks, Rod.

So, I think, it's obviously -- we've seen some increases in inventory, but that's not a surprise.

 

I think, we wholesaled rounding off rounding to 1 million vehicles during the quarter, as evidence of both producing and clearing out the vehicles that hadn't been finished in June.

So, I think, we're working through that right now.

 

I think, it's too soon to conclude anything about trends.

We do know that there's a lot of pent-up demand from the last couple of years as evidenced by both MSRPs as well as what turn rates have been doing.

 

So we're watching all of that closely, but I haven't come to any conclusions about any softening or any demand that's occurred today.

I think as you look at the dealer statistics as well as GMF, the people that are clamoring to get in our vehicles and still see high demand, particularly for the full-size trucks and SUVs.

 



Rod Lache

Thanks.

 

Anything on that commodity hedge, Paul, that you mentioned?

What -- you just concluded you're steel negotiations?

 

Is that -- do you have any measure of the magnitude of that offset?



Paul Jacobson

Yes, nothing specific today, Rod.

 

I mean, keep in mind that obviously, when you look across all of the commodities, they've come off their highs, which will benefit some tailwind next year.

As it relates to steel, remember, we've got a portfolio approach where some is on spot rate, some are on term contracts.

 

We benefited from that as steel was spiking over the last couple of years, but you'll see some lag, particularly in steel from some of those multiyear contracts, which is fine over the long-term.

But it won't provide as big of a tailwind next otherwise would.

 

So we'll get more detail on that as we give full year 2023 guidance later, but nothing specific now.



Rod Lache

Thank you.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli from Citi.

 

Itay, your line is open.



Itay Michaeli

Great.

 

Thanks.

Good morning everybody and congrats on the results.

 

Maybe just to follow-up on that last question, Paul.

Just it sounds like you do think that pricing, net of commodities, can still be, I guess, intact or neutral into next year.

 

Maybe -- just maybe hoping you can elaborate on that last comment from your prepared remarks.

And maybe also talk about the opportunities you see with the HD trucks and the midsized trucks you're launching next year.

 

It sounds like there might be some price opportunities for the company there as well.



Paul Jacobson

Yes.

 

Good morning, Itay.

So I didn't necessarily say that it was going to be flat.

 

I said it was going to be some going forward.

We already do know about some pressure that's likely to hit next year from pension accounting.

 

Keep in mind that while the funded status hasn't changed, just the differentiation of a very different rate environment is going to cause some headwinds on the pension side.

We'll know more as rates settle out at the end of the year, but that could be north of $1 billion.

 

No change to cash, no change to any funding just the way they work.

So we're watching all that.

 

That's why we're -- necessarily piecemeal, all of this stuff going forward.

But we'll provide more with our full year guidance.

 

And obviously, when you look at the launches of the new HD, there's a lot of content rich.

Vehicles coming out.

 

We've continued to see those in strong demand as we rolled them out, both across the SUVs and the light-duty pickups as well.

So we expect to see some demand coming there as customers can't get them fast enough.

 

So we think that there is some good news out there.

All of that has to be balanced by every -- that others are seeing out there, even if we're not seeing it, which is why we continue to be cautious in our approach.

 

But what we're focused on is executing every day.

And I think this quarter demonstrates the power of the team's ability to do that.

 



Itay Michaeli

That's very helpful.

 

And maybe a follow-up for Mary and Kyle.

Any update on when we should see the deployment of the Cruise Origin next year?

 

Is that more first half or second half?

And then, Kyle, when those Origins are deployed, what's your targeted ODD in San Francisco at that time?

 



Mary Barra

Kyle, do you want to take that?

 



Kyle Vogt

Sure.

 

No problem.

So to begin with, one of the things we did just recently is we started operating the Cruise Origin on the streets of San Francisco, but being driven manually for data collection.

 

And so, that's another milestone as we ramp towards production for that vehicle, volume production next year.

When we deploy initially, the ODD will probably look similar to what we're doing with our Bolts, but we're going to announce that a little later as we get closer to the deployment date for that vehicle.

 



Itay Michaeli

Okay.

 

That’s very helpful.

Thank you.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.

 

Ryan, your line is open.



Ryan Brinkman

Hi.

 

Thanks for taking my questions.

I wanted to ask on commodity costs.

 

I realize it's a complicated equation with buy-ins deal in advance, compensating suppliers in the lag, some hedging.

But just straight lining the latest spot prices through the end of 2023 would suggest to me a sizable tailwind next year.

 

So, have you done any work to try to dimension this tailwind and maybe how it might compare in magnitude to any headwind you expect to face from higher non-commodity supply chain costs, such as energy, logistics, labor or other costs?



Paul Jacobson

Hey, Ryan, again, I want to avoid getting into any specific commentary about 2023 guidance from that standpoint.

 

Obviously, we are watching not just commodities, but logistics, container rates.

Just overall, there's a lot of things that are moving around and changing and evolving.

 

So if we see slowdowns in the economy, not only would we expect commodity rates to come down further, we'd expect freight rates to come down as well.

We probably spend less on expedited premium freights that we've been spending, because the supply chain could normalize a little bit.

 

But those are the things that we're working through in the budget.

So what I'd ask is, give us time to go through that, take our Board through that.

 

And we'll let you know as soon as we pull it all together for a plan in 2023.



Ryan Brinkman

Okay.

 

Thanks.

And then just lastly, is there any color you can provide on potential settlements with suppliers to compensate them for premium non-commodity supply chain costs?

 

Ford called this out as a $1 billion headwind during this quarter versus I didn't see anything in your release along those lines.

I'm curious if you're taking a similar approach to settle more quickly, or maybe expect to spread these payments over several quarters, or just any thoughts you might be able to provide on how these negotiations with suppliers are progressing amidst the higher inflation environment and impact on GM going forward?

 



Paul Jacobson

Yes, sure.

 

So, obviously, I won't comment on any specific discussions that we're -- with our suppliers.

But as we alluded to in the prepared remarks, we had focused in on this as well as commodity prices, et cetera, as part of the $5 billion of pressure that we were going to see year-over-year.

 

We've been talking about that all year.

So the supplier world isn't new to us.

 

It's not a surprise to us.

It is, as we said in the prepared remarks, taking up a little bit more of that bucket than it was before on a percentage basis.

 

But I think, overall, we're in control of that situation, working proactively with our suppliers and making sure we're doing it a way that meets their needs as well as meeting ours and the commitments we've made to the Street.

So we won't talk about anything specific with it.

 

It's in there.

We've budgeted and planned for that, and there was no surprise from our side on what we've seen.

 

And I think it speaks to the quality of the guidance that we've been able to highlight all year.



Ryan Brinkman

Great.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.

 

Mark, your line is open.



Mark Delaney

I guess, good morning and thank you very much for taking the questions.

 

The first one is on mix, and the company spoke to some mix normalization in the prepared comments.

What do you think is driving that mix normalization?

 

Is it more about what GM has the supply to be able to produce and that broadening out beyond the higher end, or are you seeing any pressure on mix related to what consumers are able to afford given the macroeconomic backdrop?



Paul Jacobson

Nothing from the consumer side.

 

I'd say that comment was really aimed towards the fact that we cleared out the vehicles that had been built without the components at the end of June.

We talked about 75% of those being full-size trucks and SUVs.

 

So it stands to reason that with only about 25% of that pool left, you'd see some balance.

So it's really more due to production and full-size than it is anything on the consumer side.

 



Mark Delaney

That's helpful.

 

And my follow-up is on Cruise.

And as Cruise is entering the scaling-out phase, and Kyle, thanks for all updates you shared on the progress Cruise is making, are you guys able to share any more color on how investors should expect investment levels accrues to trend going forward in order to support that ramp-up relative to the current level of investment?

 

Thanks.



Mary Barra

Kyle, I don't know if you want to comment.

 

I mean, I'll just say, we roughly see it slightly higher than 2022 levels, and that's what we're building into the plan.

Okay?

 

Anything else, Mark?



Mark Delaney

Thank you.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.

 

Adam, your line is open.



Adam Jonas

Thanks.

 

I just had a follow-up on Cruise.

Again, thinking quarterly, cash consumption was $0.5 billion this quarter, rolling out though into two new cities by the end of the year, further expansion.

 

I just want to confirm, Mary, that if we kind of continue that quarterly run rate of 0.5, maybe increase it slightly, but not dramatically.

Is that a fair assumption from here?

 



Mary Barra

I think, yes, that's a fair assumption.

 

And then remember, as we start to scale, we do have a line of credit for the vehicles from GM Financial.



Adam Jonas

Thanks, Mary.

 

Just a follow-up on GM Financial.

While up slightly, the delinquencies, as you pointed out, still really low at 2.5% and net charge-offs below pre-pandemic levels.

 

Just curious how you would describe the credit outlook for GM Financial.

What changes are you making in your portfolio to prepare for further rises in rates and impact on portfolio performance?

 

I figured it's an unusual environment given how much of the business has been order-booked.

But correct me if I'm wrong, you're moving more into a kind of that -- at the margin to that just in time market that we're familiar with.

 

There's still some order books.

So I'd appreciate what you're hearing in real time from the dealers on the credit side.

 

Thanks.



Dan Berce

Hi.

 

Yes, Adam, this is Dan Berce.

Yes, first of all, as you point out, our credit metrics are really still quite strong.

 

Pre-pandemic, our net losses ran in the 1.5% range.

So they're less than half of that now at 70 basis points.

 

For several years running now, our portfolio is skewed more and more to prime consumers, and that's defined as 680-plus FICOs.

In fact, recent vintages have been 80% prime, and our whole portfolio now is 72% prime.

 

It's also heavily new car finance related, which typically has been a stronger credit profile.

Prime consumers, period, typically have a stronger balance sheet buffer, better income levels and historically have been more resilient in weaker economic times.

 

As I said last quarter, to your question, our new car portfolio continues to perform substantially better than pre-pandemic levels.

Our used car non-prime book is showing more normalization.

 

And as always, we always look for targeted ways to improve our underwriting and now is no exception.

So that would be the area of most focused, the used car non-prime book.

 

That all being said, we overall expect some normalization in credit, especially with weaker economic conditions.

But our reserve levels already contemplate that.

 

And from a dealer standpoint, the through-the-door application flow really doesn't look different now with the on-the-run buyers as opposed to order book buyers.

We haven't really seen any difference at the dealer level at all.

 



Adam Jonas

Really appreciate that color.

 

Thank you.

Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.

 

Emmanuel, your line is open.



Emmanuel Rosner

Thank you, very much and good morning.

 

First, a quick follow-up on the delay in the battery ramp-up.

Can you please remind us, which of the EV models were going to basically use cells from these plants you're ramping up?

 

And therefore, we'll see some sort of delay in their volume ramp up?

And, I guess, more broadly, how are you going to prioritize cell allocation over the next, call it, 18 months or so, when you're a bit more constrained than maybe expected?

 



Mary Barra

Yes, Emmanuel.

 

So because of the Ultium platform, we really have a lot of flexibility.

So the cells coming from Ultium, which are now in production, will be flowing first to support HUMMER production.

 

And we have over 90,000 orders there.

And then LYRIQ, which we have really strong interest in both -- the two model years were already sold out for the availables and we have strong interest.

 

But then as we get into next year, they'll be spread across also Silverado, Blazer and Equinox EVs for Chevrolet and some of our other models.

So we will allocate them across all of those somewhat based on demand and as each of those plants ramp.

 

And we'll make that somewhat dynamically as we go next year, but we'll spread them across all of those vehicles.

And, again, this is just a slight shift in the acceleration as we get into 2024, because we'll have a plant coming online next year and the following year, you're going to see a steeper ramp.

 

And that's what gives me great confidence in getting to the million units by 2025.



Emmanuel Rosner

Okay.

 

Thanks for the color.

And then, the follow-up was, if you could put a finer point on some of the demand trends you're seeing sort of real time, both in the US and China, if possible.

 



Mary Barra

I think we've covered most of this.

 

I'll start, Paul, and then if you want to add anything.

I mean, again, we're still seeing very strong demand.

 

I think what's specific to GM is, we have a very strong truck portfolio.

If you look at what we have right now, we've refreshed the light-duty trucks.

 

We have now not only the heavy duties coming out early next year, but we also have an all-new midsize truck.

So I think that puts us in a very strong position with trucks.

 

Regardless of what the environment is, I think we're going to have a very strong offering from a customer perspective and choice across the full range of those vehicles.

We are still seeing strong ATPs, but we're watching carefully to see if and when they moderate, also balancing against incentives.

 

We're going to continue, we think, to see some semiconductor challenges and, I'll say, overall challenges from the supply base.

It's still very tight when you look at how long we've been running at that.

 

Even a small hiccup usually has an impact.

And so we're going to continue to work those issues, but we see that improving as well.

 

So I think the big thing that we're looking at is what will demand be.

There's still a lot of different predictions on what the economic situation will be.

 

But I think, overall, from where we are from a low inventory perspective, strong product offering.

And I think we're well positioned to manage through it.

 

I don't know, Paul, if you want to add anything.



Paul Jacobson

Yes.

 

Mary, I'll just add that we're still very much in a production-constrained world as an industry against where demand is.

And as we look to 2023, we've said publicly that we're kind of planning for a 15 million SAAR year, which is kind of below where most people peg demand, but it's actually of where actuals have been for most of the year, given some of those supply constraints.

 

So I think everything Mary said is absolutely true.

We're watching it very closely.

 

We are planning for some tightness next year, but that's because we want to be on the proper side.

We don't want to get surprised if we see that trending lower.

 

So hopefully, demand remains strong going into 2023, and we can outperform the expectations that we're putting on paper right now.

But that's -- 2023.

 



Emmanuel Rosner

And then in China and the new ones there?

 



Mary Barra

In China, I think we're -- as we now have the LYRIQ, we started offering the LYRIQ in September, and we'll have the Buick Ultium-based product.

 

Those are two very important brands that we do well in China.

I think we'll continue to see strength in the Hong Guang MINI EV.

 

So I think the real opportunity for us in China is to now, with the products we have, grow our EV portfolio while maintaining our cost.

And we'll look to see how the company or the country does from an economic perspective.

 

But we have a strong portfolio coming from an EV perspective, and I'm really proud of what the team is doing in light of volatile and different headwinds that they face, especially with some of the COVID situation.



Emmanuel Rosner

Great.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Our next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.

 

Colin, your line is open.



Colin Langan

Great.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

Any color on pricing?

 

I mean any color?

Has it improved sequentially?

 

I know that year-over-year, it's still quite a big tailwind.

And should we expect it to stay strong?

 

It just feels like there's an awful lot of headwinds out there.

Rates are rising.

 

Used car prices are falling.

And I know you highlighted demand is strong, but a lot of the market data is a little cautionary.

 

I think some of the dealers are saying pre-sold vehicles are sort of back to normal levels with the very -- being very few left, and inventory has ticked up and sales really haven't moved yet, which you would think the demand was there.

So should we think pricing is going to have to move for you in the industry to kind of keep the demand flowing?

 



Paul Jacobson

So, Colin, I'll take a shot.

 

Mary, you can add anything.

Certainly, I think this comes down to the question of how much pent-up demand is there, which I don't think is necessarily specifically knowable over time.

 

But what we're really focused on is trends going forward and managing to those trends, as we have throughout this year.

The customer has obviously been very resilient.

 

And I think that speaks to the quality of our products and what they sought.

So I don't think that piece is going to change.

 

I think the industry could normalize.

We could see that, although I don't think we see big increases in production going forward.

 

So depending on how that pent-up demand shakes out, I think that will affect inventory.

But what you're hearing from everyone in the industry -- learned in inventory management over the last couple of years.

 

And we ourselves have cited some of that.

So even if we assume some slight softness in 2023, as I talked about on the SAAR side, we're not seeing it as sort of a major shakeup.

 



Colin Langan

Got it.

 

And then, just following up on the questions around the IRA.

Just for clarification, I think you said, you see, I think, over 10 years, the potential to get the full $7,500.

 

I mean -- and then out the gate, you think you can get the $3,750 for sort of the battery component part of it.

I mean is that -- I wasn't sure if the $7,500, there's also the commercial credits?

 

Is the $7,500 just for retail buyers that you think is possible, because that sourcing part seems to be the most challenging to get at?



Mary Barra

Yes.

 

We think, out of the gate, we're going to be eligible for the $3,750, and we'll ramp to have full qualification in the next two to three years, getting up to the $7,500.

So -- which positions us well to be eligible for the complete credit from the consumer perspective.

 

The $7,500 one through the 10 years, it just takes a couple of years to ramp up based on our expectations with the supply moves that we've already made.

And then, as I mentioned, there's also the -- to leverage the tax credit of up to $45 per kilowatt hour with battery cells and battery modules produced in the US.

 

Again, we're well positioned there.

And then the commercial incentives, I think, are going to be very important, especially with BrightDrop, our fleet and rental car.

 

So those opportunities, as well as use used EV purchase incentives as well.

So, again, we're waiting to see what treasury does from a rule perspective, but those are just a few of the opportunities we think we're well positioned for and, frankly, better than most.

 



Colin Langan

Great.

 

Thanks for taking my question.
Operator

Our last question comes from James Picariello from BNP Paribas.

 

James, your line is open.



James Picariello

Hi.

 

Good morning, everyone.

Just at a high level, the sequential walk to the full year adjusted EBIT midpoint of $14 billion, just curious if you could provide the major puts and takes to get to the midpoint.

 

Obviously, it would be a sequential decline in the fourth quarter relative to a very strong third quarter.

Yes, just any color there would be great.

 



Mary Barra

Paul, do you want to take that?

 



Paul Jacobson

Yes, sure.

 

So, I would say, it starts with the wholesale, obviously, we had a really strong quarter as not only did -- were we able to produce, but we also cleared out 75% of that.

So it was a little bit front weighted.

 

If you recall back in the June quarter call, we talked about being 50-50 of clearing those out.

So there's nothing sequentially different about the business that we're talking about.

 

But I would expect that we cut wholesale a little bit, just off of the fact that we cleared out the majority of those vehicles from June.



James Picariello 

Okay.

 

And just on that, in terms of the 25% to 30% wholesales growth, is there a bias towards the lower half of that range based on how supply chains are shaping up and how the third quarter came in, or how should we think about that?



Paul Jacobson

Yes.

 

No specific commentary on that range, as Mary highlighted, we -- while the chip and the logistics environment is generally improving, there are still some short-term impacts that we digest on a regular basis.

And the team does a good job of working through though, but I wouldn't want to get more specific than the 25% to 30%.

 



James Picariello 

Thanks guys.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments.



End of Q&A



Mary Barra

Well, thank you, Madison.

 

And I just have a couple of comments to close the call.

First and foremost, I hope everyone is hearing that the entire team is focused on meeting our commitments and just driving results that support the rapid scaling of our EV business and driving continued strong margins.

 

I think over the last two years, especially, we've demonstrated resiliency and the ability to manage headwinds, many times that have even been stronger than we've seen in the past.

And going forward, we'll continue to show that agility and resiliency and adjust whenever we need to do what we need to do to stay on track.

 

And so I'm very confident of our transformation that's underway, and I think next year is a big year for us.

You'll hear at our Investor Day in November much more about the EV strategy, including the KPIs.

 

So I hope you will attend.

And Paul, Kyle, Dan and I thank you for the questions today, and we look forward to seeing many of you there, and again, couldn't be more committed to where we are, clearly in execution mode from a GM perspective with our EV/AV strategy.

 

So thank you, everyone.

Have a good day.

 
Operator

That concludes the conference call for today.

 

Thank you for joining.","


Martin Viecha

Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Tesla’s Third Quarter 2022 Q&A Webcast.

 

My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations and I am joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives.

Our Q3 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m.

 

Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.

During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.

 

These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.

Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.

 

During the Q&A session portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.

Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.

 

But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.

Elon?

 



Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.

 

So just to do a Q3 recap.

Q3 was another record quarter on many levels.

 

We had our industry-leading operating margin reach 17%.

And our free cash flow surpassed $3 billion in Q3 and approached $9 billion in the past 12 months.

 

As our factories ramp, we’re looking forward to a record-breaking Q4.

So it really, knock on wood, looks like we’ll have an epic end of year.

 

So, Q4 is looking extremely good.

On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of 2,000 cars made in a week with very good quality and is ramping rapidly.

 

Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon.

And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday’s build rate, it would be 2,000.

 

Our production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.

We are finally gaining rapid traction on the 4680 cell.

 

And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.

We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas, which continues to show great progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.

 

The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.

And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.

 

Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.

Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow exponentially.

 

Our goal with that AI Day was to [post] (ph) recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial intelligence engineer and scientist resume.

So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.

 

I can’t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.

So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America.

 

So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program this year, probably about a month from now.

So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will immediately have that available to them.

 

So, the safety that we’re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we’re seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.

Let’s see, with respect to demand.

 

We’ve got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks.

I can’t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into future as we can see.

 

So, the factories are running at full speed, and we’re delivering every car we make and keeping operating margins strong.

We are still a very small percentage of the total vehicles on the road.

 

Of the 2 billion cars and trucks on the road, we only have about 3.5 million.

So, we’ve got a long way to go to even reach 1% of the global fleet.

 

Let’s see.

Based on many -- what people -- based on many things, but certainly questions I get on Twitter about buybacks.

 

And I think every one of our Board members has gotten questions about buybacks.

We’ve debated the buyback idea extensively at the Board level.

 

The Board generally thinks that it makes sense to do a buyback.

But we want to work through the right process to do a buyback, but it’s certainly possible for us to do a buyback on the order of $5 billion to $10 billion, even in the downside scenario next year, even -- given if next year is a very difficult year, we still have the ability to do a $5 billion to $10 billion buyback.

 

This is obviously pending Board review and approval.

So, it’s likely that we’ll do some meaningful buyback.

 

So, in conclusion, while the market themes revolve around the short term, it’s very important to focus on the long term.

I can’t emphasize this enough with investors and I think long-time investors, obviously recognize it with Tesla.

 

You have your sort of local ups and downs, but long-term trend has been extremely good.

And several years ago, I said, I think on an earnings call, and I thought it was possible for Tesla to be worth more than Apple, which was then the highest market cap company, I think, in the market.

 

And Apple at that time, I think it was around $700 billion.

And I said it required incredible execution, at least some luck, and we did indeed achieve that.

 

Tesla went, in fact, or passed Apple’s market cap at the time.

And now, I’m of the opinion that we can far exceed Apple’s current market cap.

 

In fact, I see a potential path for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined.

So, now that doesn’t mean it will happen or that will be easy.

 

In fact, I think it will be very difficult.

It will require a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion and always the luck.

 

But for the first time, I am seeing -- I see a way for Tesla to be -- let’s say, roughly twice the value of Saudi Aramco.

And I think that’s -- I haven’t quite seen that yet.

 

I mean, this is the first time I’ve seen that potential.

So, we have an incredible product portfolio.

 

I think we’ve got the most exciting product portfolio of any company on earth, some of which you’ve heard about, some of which you haven’t.

We’re in the final lap for Cybertruck.

 

We’re building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas [Indiscernible] and making a lot of progress in the robotaxi platform design.

And then, with respect to batteries, we’re moving as fast as possible to have -- to achieve 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production capacity in the United States, vertically integrated, anode-cathode, [Indiscernible] refining, we’re moving at top speed to do that.

 

So I think it’s an incredibly exciting future and really an unprecedented future.

None of this would be possible without the incredible team that we have here at Tesla.

 

So, I’d like to give a huge shout-out to all of our factory employees, engineers, executives and the whole Tesla team.

You guys rock.

 

You’re the ones making it happen.

Thank you.

 

Thank you, everyone.



Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

 

And Zach has some opening remarks as well.



Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

 

Thanks, Martin.

Just to continue on Elon’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.

 

On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2% with automotive gross margin at 27.9%.

Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.

 

However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.

Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%.

 

Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability.

We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at length on prior calls.

 

In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.

On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.

 

Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact on working capital.

Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2nd, we’ve started to experience limits on outbound logistics capacity which we didn’t anticipate.

 

This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the U.S.

and Europe.

 

Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter.

Just to put this in perspective, roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the final two weeks.

 

As a result, we’ve begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound logistics.

We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs and improve the experience of our customers.

 

As we look ahead, our plans show that we’re on track for the 50% annual growth in production this year, although we are tracking supply chain risks which are beyond our control.

On the delivery side, we do expect to be just under 50% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end of the year, as noted, just above.

 

This means that, again, you should expect a gap between production and deliveries in Q4, and those cars in transit will be delivered shortly to their customers upon arrival to their destination in Q1.

Austin and Berlin ramp costs will continue to weigh on margins, although we expect the impact to be less than what we saw in Q3.

 

And as Elon mentioned, we are continuing to build as many cars as possible while also maintaining strong operating margins.

Thank you.

 



A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

 

And let’s go first to the shareholder questions.

The first shareholder question is, given the stringent battery content and assembly requirements for consumer tax credit eligibility under the Inflation Reduction Act, can you speak to Tesla’s ability to meet those thresholds in each of 2023, 2024 and 2025 through your existing and planned supply chain?

 



Elon Musk

Well, yes, I mean, I think just at a high level, I’d say, we do expect to fully meet the IRA’s requirements.

 

Do you want to add?



Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

 

We view that passing of the Inflation Reduction Act as a significant boost towards accelerating automation, while also scaling the battery supply chain at large in the United States.

We expect Treasury to publish detailed guidance by the end of the year.

 

Until such time, it’s difficult to fully determine the eligibility criteria, but we believe Tesla is very well positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles.



Elon Musk

Yes, like I said, we’re -- like I said earlier, we’re going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly possible to get to 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production in the U.S.

 

vertically integrated.



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

Let’s go to the next question.

The next question is, what updates can you offer on the backlog and the recent order intake trends, especially outside of the U.S.

 

and especially in China?”



Elon Musk

Well, it’s -- there’s definitely -- China is experiencing adverse of a recession of sorts, which is property market -- simply from a property market mostly.

 

And Europe has recession of sorts driven by energy.

The U.S.

 

actually isn’t -- North America is in a pretty good health, although the Fed is raising interest rates more than they should, but I think they’ll eventually realize that and bring back down again.

Demand is a little higher than it would otherwise be.

 

But as I said earlier, we are extremely confident of the great Q4, and we anticipate continuing to grow our vehicle production, sales deliveries by -- on average 50% a year as far into the future as we can see.



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 



Elon Musk

Actually one caveat, I should say, growing production by 50% every year because deliveries -- we’re trying to smooth out the deliveries and not have this crazy delivery rate at the end of every quarter, so.

 

In fact, we’re just fundamentally running out of -- there weren’t enough boats, there weren’t enough trains, there weren’t enough car carriers to actually support the wave because it got too big.

So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.

 



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?

Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?

 

Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising?

There are three questions there.

 



Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.

 

We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.

It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more.

 

In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

We could, but who wants?

Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.

 



Zachary Kirkhorn

Committed to continuing...

 



Elon Musk

Yes, we obviously are -- yes.

 

But we’ll also be committed to continuous growth.

Yes.

 

At Tesla, we’ve always been committed to continuous improvement.

So, as friends might have asked me like, when should I buy a car, I’m like now because we just keep improving the cars.

 



Zachary Kirkhorn

There’s always the latest Tesla.

 



Elon Musk

Yes, there’s still latest Tesla.

 

I don’t really -- yes, the -- every now and again, we do have some big technology upgrade, like Plaid.

And by the way, I think the Plaid Model S and X are the best cars on earth.

 

There’s nothing even close, in my opinion.

Just try one.

 

Epic.



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

The next question is, “We keep hearing of dire energy crisis in Germany this winter.

What are Tesla’s plans to combat power cuts?

 

And will there be any delays in ramp-up in production from Giga Berlin because of this?”



Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I can take that.

 

I think two points on this question.

The first is just that based upon everything that we know, we don’t see this as a large risk to the Company.

 

Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long term of the Company.



Elon Musk

But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.

 



Zachary Kirkhorn

No.

 

And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.

Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.

 

So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck?

What is the initial Phase 1 production target?

 

When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”



Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.

 

We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.

We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing...

 



Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?

 



Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.

 

That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into 2023.



Elon Musk

Great.

 

Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick.

That is going to be a hall of famer, next level.

 

Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.



Martin Viecha

Right.

 

Thank you.



Elon Musk

Of course.

 

There’s Tesla Semi, of course.

So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st.

 

I’ll be there in person.

And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck.

 

That’s a Class A truck, Class A truck.



Zachary Kirkhorn

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.

 



Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range.

 

Just to be clear, 500 miles with the cargo.

Yes, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground.

 

Yes, sure.

Not up.

 

It’s excellent.

But the point is, it’s a long-range truck and even with heavy cargo.

 

And the number of times people tell, no, you can’t -- it’s impossible to make a long-range heavy-duty Class A truck.

And then, I’ll ask, well, what are your assumptions about what hour kilogram and what hours per mile, and they look at me with a blank stare and then say hydrogen.

 

I’m like, no, that’s not the answer, I was looking for numbers, literally.

It’s not a number.

 

It’s [indiscernible] table.

You obviously don’t need hydrogen for heavy truck.

 

And we’ll be ramping up Semi production through next year.

As I think everyone knows at this point, it takes about a year to ramp up production.

 

So, we expect to see significant -- we’re tentatively aiming for 50,000 units in 2024 for Tesla Semi in North America.

And obviously, we’ll expand beyond North America.

 

And these would sell -- I don’t want to say the exact prices, but they’re much more than a passenger vehicle.

So, with a few thousand heavy trucks of this nature, it would be worth several Model Ys.

 



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

The next question is, what is the progress of the 4680 cell ramp?

And what factors determine whether vehicles get 2170s versus 4680 cells?

 

And how will that change in the next year?



Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, ramp is going well, as Elon said.

 

Total output is up 3x quarter-over-quarter, and production is tracking to exceed 1,000 car cells per week this quarter, as we said last quarter.

Our focus is now shifting from 100% ramp to cost and further expanding production capacity in North America, as Elon also mentioned.

 

On the 2170 versus 4680, in our factories, we really attempt to minimize factory complexity and product changeover while still making sure we get enough new product into the field to learn how it is performing.

And that sort of mix is going to shift as 4680 scales here and the overall factory ramp proceeds in Texas.

 



Elon Musk

Right.

 

Basically, production of 4680 ramp is growing exponentially.

And yes, it’s going well.

 

We’re just looking at this -- just going to be a major pack in the future.



Zachary Kirkhorn

[Indiscernible]

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

And like I said, we’re -- our goal is to strive towards 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of annualized production in United States alone by Tesla, not including [indiscernible], will be on top of that.



Unidentified Company Representative

We need to get 300 to 400 terawatt hours to accomplish our goal.

 



Elon Musk

Yes, there’s roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is 300,000 to 400,000 gigawatt hours or 300 to 400 terawatt hours.

 



Unidentified Company Representative

So when you’re like one tower assembling a lot, well, a lot of terawatt hours to go by.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

On the cathode side -- we think it will probably be iron and most of the iron -- iron can scale to very, very high tonnage and then some nickel.

The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it’s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, maybe more.

 

And then there’s the manganese wildcard as well.



Unidentified Company Representative

And on that note, we’re pursuing aggressively North American iron supplies.

 

And how -- yes, we can talk more about that at a future date.



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

The next question was on the Semi truck, which we already addressed.

So I’m going to skip to the next one.

 

Can you talk about how Tesla could adjust if we were to enter a prolonged recession, including new product prioritization, investment flexibility, new factory versus factory expansion, service support infrastructure, productivity cost measures and demand stimulation alternatives?



Elon Musk

Well, to be frank, we’re very pedal to the metal come rain or shine.

 

So, we are not reducing our production in a meaningful way, recession or not recession.



Zachary Kirkhorn

It’s the 1% point come in.

 



Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.

 

So I think the public, at large, realizes that everyone’s moving towards electric vehicles and that it’s foolish to actually buy a new gasoline car at this point because the residual value of that gasoline car is going to be very low.

So, I think we have to be in a very good spot.

 

But I wouldn’t say it’s recession proof, but it’s certainly recession resilient because basically earth has -- people both have in large part made the decision to move away from gasoline cars to electric cars.

And then, in transitioning a generation to sustainable, you need solar and wind with the stationary battery pack to buffer the power.

 

So, you have 24/7 power because the wind doesn’t go -- travel time.

So that also -- we actually see the energy storage business, stationary storage, growing more like 150% to 200% a year, faster than cars by a lot.

 



Zachary Kirkhorn

Just to add before you jump in, Martin.

 

Just to echo Elon’s point, I mean, I think where our cash balance is, what our forecasted cash generation is, where our margins are as a company, I mean we can withstand quite a lot of downside before we would have to dig into our capital plans, Supercharger expansion, product lineup.

So, the business has done quite well over the last handful of quarters.

 

And this is a real opportunity, I think, for the Company to press forward, in most aggressive way, as Elon has mentioned.



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

And we try to model out like, let’s say, 2023 is a brutal recession year.

Even then, we generate meaningful cash.

 

Once you get out of that…



Martin Viecha

Great.

 

Thank you very much.

And let’s go to the last investor question, which is the progression from Tesla’s first platform with S and X to the second platform with 3 and Y, led to a 50% reduction in cost of goods sold.

 

When do you see Tesla’s third platform being released?

And what level of cost of goods sold reduction could you achieve?

 



Elon Musk

Well, we don’t want to talk exact dates, but this is a -- I mean, the primary focus of our new vehicle development team, obviously.

 

At this point, we’ve done the engineering for Cybertrucks and for Semi.

So, it’s obviously against what we’re working on, which is the next-generation vehicle, which will be probably about the cost of 3 and Y platform.

 

It will be smaller, to be clear.

But it will, I think, certainly become -- certainly exceed the production of all our other vehicles combined.

 

I mean, obviously, we’re going to take everything we learned from S, X, 3, Y, Cybertruck and Semi and forward into that platform.

But we -- as you’ve said to us many times, we’re on a 2-for-1 target.

 

So, we’re trying to get to that 50% number again.

It’s like, we’re going to take two.

 

That’s exactly what [indiscernible] how we make two cars for the amount of effort that currently takes us to make one Model 3.



Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

 

Effort costs.



Elon Musk

Yes…

 



Zachary Kirkhorn

Half the loss, half the past, half the factory floor space.

 



Elon Musk

We’re twice the output.

 

And we do believe this can be done.

By the way, I should mention that -- when I said that probably now that I see a path in extremely -- very difficult path, incredible execution required, a massive amount of hard work and some luck to get to where Tesla is with as much as Apple and Saudi Aramco combined, I wasn’t including Optimus.

 



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

Let’s go to analyst questions next.

The first question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.

 

Adam, go ahead and unmute.



Adam Jonas

Great.

 

Can you hear me?



Martin Viecha

Yes.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 



Adam Jonas

So Elon, would you consider vertically integrating into mining?

 

That’s my first question.



Elon Musk

We’ll do whatever we have to.

 

Whatever the limiting factor is, we’ll do.

We do not personally constrain ourselves.

 

We don’t particularly integrate just for the hell of particularly integrating.

Like if there was a great supplier who’s better than us or we think actively is very good, or even where the economics of comparative advantage suggest that we should use that supplier, even if we could beat them, but we could use our resources to do something else that will be more productive, then we would in source in that case.

 

But if we have to go mine, we will mine.



Adam Jonas

Okay.

 

Thanks, Elon.

My follow-up is 1 terawatt hour of manufacturing in the United States, vertically integrated.

 

I guess, my question is, what would need to change with U.S.

permitting laws to allow that?

 

Kind of what would be your message to this administration or next?

And do you think you could do a terawatt hour?

 

What’s the going price of that?

Can you do that for under $100 billion in the States?

 

Thanks.



Elon Musk

Well, I mean, I think the message to the government would be that there should be -- I should say, we’ve actually had conversations with a number of senior government leaders, White House, Congress and whatnot.

 

And the suggestion that we have is that there should be an expedited permitting process for anything which is critical to a sustainable energy future.

So, it doesn’t make sense to put like a coal mine and a sustainable energy battery like lithium mine in the same category.

 

Coal does not in the future, lithium does.

And by the way, you can extract lithium with almost no disturbance to the local environment.

 

So, it’s not actually ugly, nasty mine situation.

So, I would recommend expedited permitting would really be helpful.

 

Basically, a fast track environmentally -- I think in sense fast track things that are important for the environment and humanity for sure.

That seems logical.

 

And the reception has been positive.

So, we’ll see if something happens with that.

 

I think probably on this earnings call, we’re not ready to go into financial details of the -- what it will take to get there.

But what we are seeing is practical improvements as we redesign the whole supply chain and all of the elements that go into battery cell.

 

We’re figuring out dramatic efficiencies.

And I think we’ll -- net result which would be that the capital required to achieve that level of output will be much less than what people think.

 



Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

 

Let’s go to the next question from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.

Colin, go ahead and unmute.

 



Colin Langan

Can you hear me now?

 



Martin Viecha

Yes, we can hear you.

 



Colin Langan

Okay.

 

Sorry about that.

Any update on full self-driving?

 

I think you had said a couple of quarters ago, it would be available by the end of the year.

Is that still possible?

 

Is it -- would it still be like a Level 4 or Level 5 that you’re talking about?

And are there any sort of regulatory hurdles you’d have to think about?

 



Elon Musk

We -- as I said earlier, we’re expecting to release the full self-driving software to anyone who orders the package by the end of this year.

 

So, a separate matter as to will it have regulatory approval.

It won’t have regulatory approval at that time.

 

But the car will be able to take you from your home to your work, your friend’s house, to the grocery store without you touching wheel.

So, it’s looking very good.

 



Colin Langan

And it would mean like Level 4, Level 5 kind of traditional definition you’re talking about?

 



Elon Musk

Well, there’s - this debate is like what’s the -- what are the interventions per mile and maybe safety interventions per mile.

 

Like we’re not saying that that’s quite ready to have no one behind the wheel.

It’s just that you will almost never have to touch the control, vehicle controllers.

 

So, like when I came to Giga Texas from Brent’s house, I never touched any of the controls already here.

And then there is a longer process of like called the march of nines of like how many nines reliability do you need before you could really be comfortable saying that the car could drive with no one in it.

 

And that’s some subjectivity as to how many nines you need.

But I think we’ll be pretty close to having enough nines that you’re going to have no one in the car by the end of this year.

 

And certainly, without a question, that’s whatever in my mind next year.

I think we’ll also have an update next year to be able to show to regulators that the car is safer much so than the average human.

 



Colin Langan

Got it.

 

And just as a follow-up.

You mentioned in the prior questions about IRA.

 

I mean, it sounded like you thought you could get -- can you get all of it?

I mean, because my interpretation is like the production credits, battery component credits for buyers seems very likely for you guys.

 

Is the sourcing part of it possible?

Because that seems like a pretty tough hurdle given how much has to be sourced from the U.S.

 



Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.

 

So, we have a cross-functional team that’s looking very closely.

As you mentioned, the sourcing threshold increases by the year.

 

So, we’re looking at all options and also getting some clarification from Treasury.

That’s -- it’s important to say that’s only a fraction of the other credits.

 

We do manufacture ourselves in the U.S.

We manufacture the modules in the U.S.

 

So, that’s a pretty thin.

So yes, we feel confident that we’ll have a path as these incentives -- as the threshold sort of increases by the year.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

We’ll meet those thresholds..



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.



Colin Rusch

The operating leverage has been pretty impressive here.

 

And I’m curious about areas where you could invest in an incremental way, whether it’s on the R&D side or on the sales side to accelerate growth or cost reduction, or should we be thinking about this level of spend on a go-forward basis and some significant operating leverage as you scale up from here?



Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

 

I mean, our operating leverage has improved quite a bit.

It’s the lowest this quarter, I think, ever, and by a decent amount, OpEx as a percentage of revenue.

 

I mean, our forecast is that it will keep reducing.

I mean, I think the way to think about it is our total amount of operating expenses will slowly tick up as the company grows.

 

It’s very hard to keep it flat with the rapid growth of the Company, but it’s growing much slower.

So some amount of growth there, but the top line of the business is growing so quickly.

 

So, I think there continues to be enormous opportunity to improve the overhead efficiency of the business, and we’re seeing it.



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

Look, we are in the -- at least for now, quite in a good position of -- we’re investing in everything we can think of to possibly invest in, and we’re still generating cash.

So, I guess, it gets a pretty good place to be.

 



Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

 

I mean, how many R&D programs are we running in parallel right now?



Elon Musk

People don’t even know old R&D stuff for that.

 

There are some of it, but a bunch of it.



Zachary Kirkhorn

I also don’t think cash is a good gauge of how much R&D you’re doing.

 



Elon Musk

No.

 

It isn’t because like it’s not like -- it’s not like engineers -- they’re not generic.

So it’s just like if you could you spend $5 billion or $10 billion, that will like -- that your actual R&D -- useful product ship will be proportionate to that.

 

It’s just not true.

Engineers on -- coming off some assembly line like cookies or something.

 



Zachary Kirkhorn

Until we get optimistic.

 



Elon Musk

Get optimistic.

 

Don’t change things.

What matters is where are the most brilliant people working?

 

And Tesla remains the -- Tesla and SpaceX are two companies where the smartest engineers want to work.



Zachary Kirkhorn

I mean, like we don’t have to spend billions of dollars to invest in the future and invent the future.

 

Engineers are also cost conscious.

And we don’t just burn the money out the window when we’re trying to do R&D.

 

I wouldn’t stop looking at like R&D as a cash investment for...



Elon Musk

I think 1 nickel Tesla is frankly worth an infinite number of dollars.

 

You could have like a -- almost same the number of credit shares and they would not be able to do work 1 nickel of Tesla we can do.

You can’t make it up in volume.

 



Martin Viecha

Okay.

 

Thank you very much.

Let’s go to the next question from George at Canaccord.

 



George Gianarikas

I think, at your Annual Shareholders’ event, where Elon mentioned that the prices of many of the materials used in your production have started to come off the boil.

 

If that continues, does that give you an opportunity to adjust prices globally after several increases?

Thanks.

 



Elon Musk

Well, we’re looking at the prices of -- prices closely.

 

I mean, obviously, anyone can just Google what the price of -- future price of copper or steel is going to be.

It’s just like one Google Search away.

 

And everyone can see that the commodities on a go-forward basis are on a dropping a lot.

But in electric vehicles, things like battery-grade lithium are still crazy expensive.

 

So, we’ve got a mixture of things where prices are dropping and things where prices are increasing.



Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.

 

I would say quarter-over-quarter, steel -- aluminum has stopped anywhere between 17% to 20% at the same time on the battery side.



Zachary Kirkhorn

And cost of shipping has come down tremendously.

 

Like last year, the cost of a container on the spot market from Shanghai got as high as $20,000.

And now it’s $3,500, $3,600.

 

It’s that kind of reality.

We’re seeing deflation in a lot of commodities with a few exceptions as Elon mentioned on batteries.

 



Elon Musk

There’s more deflation than inflation.

 



Zachary Kirkhorn

Definitely.

 



Elon Musk

And again, this is publicly available information.

 

Anyone could just Google it.

And I think Cathie Wood at Ark Invest is making this point over and over again, to the Fed and the Fed is not listening because they’re looking at the rearview mirror instead of looking out the front windshield.

 



Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

 

Just to add a little bit more context.

So, commodity increases were the highest in Q3 that we’ve seen over the last two years.

 

And so, when indexes change, it does take time before they fully reflect.



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

There’s latency.



Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

 

There’s latency.



Elon Musk

That’s why I say that the Fed’s decisions make sense if you’re looking out through the rearview mirror, but not if you look out the windshield.

 

And actually we’ve got front windshield.



Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

 

And so what -- at least of what we know so far, the peak on the commodity side in Q3 -- I say peak, hopefully, it stays the peak, hopefully, it starts to come down.

There is a small amount of production that we’re seeing going into our Q4 cost structure from steel and aluminum primarily, but it’s less than 10% of the total increases we’ve seen so far.

 

So we’re optimistic here based upon what we’re seeing on the indexes for some of our cost structure that this will start to come in over time.

But I just want to set expectations that there’s not some windfall of cost reduction in this space coming in Q4, maybe some as we go into next year.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

We’ll probably see some cost reduction in 2023.

I’ll be surprised if we did not.

 



George Gianarikas

And just as a follow-up, this is for Elon.

 

With your pending acquisition of Twitter and your stakes in SpaceX and Neuralink and Tesla, how much would the combined companies benefit from operating under a single super structure, if at all, like a Google Alphabet?



Elon Musk

It’s not clear to me what the overlap is.

 

It’s not zero, but it’s -- I think we’re reaching.

I’m not worried about it.

 

I’m not an investor.

I’m an engineer and a manufacturing person and a technologist.

 

So, I actually work and design and develop products.

That’s what I do.

 

So, it’s not a -- we’re not going to have a portfolio sort of investments over it.

So, I don’t know.

 

I don’t see obvious sort of some -- get combined under an umbrella, at least right now.

So, I am excited about the Twitter situation because obviously another part incredibly well.

 

And I think it’s massive that this sort of languished for a long time, but has an incredible potential.

Although, obviously, myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for Twitter right now, the long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is, in order of magnitude, greater than its current value.

 



Martin Viecha

Let’s go to the next question from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.

 



Pierre Ferragu

Can you hear me, guys?

 



Martin Viecha

Yes, we can hear you now.

 



Pierre Ferragu

Great.

 

I’d love to have another update on 4680, Drew.

So last time we talked about it, there were -- it was a question about like scaling up with manufacturing and there were still a few things to get right.

 

Is it fair to say that now you are at scale, and it’s just a question of logistics to get bigger?

So, that’s question number one.

 

And then, question number two, on the kind of like innovation and cost reduction and efficiency improvements kind of path that you described at the battery day, where are we today?

And how much time is it going to take to deliver all the potential you outlined then?

 



Unidentified Company Representative

Well, I’ll take the second question first.

 

At Battery Day, we showed a time line out to 2026 for all of the ideas we had proposed and had shared with everybody then.



Elon Musk

Yes, I’d be surprised.

 

I think we’ll do better than that.



Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.

 

I mean, but just that’s the rough -- just give to you all -- it’s on that order.

It’s not like a month.

 

It’s not six months.

It’s years.

 

And we are executing on all of those different ideas pretty aggressively in parallel with the OpEx that some people think isn’t enough, but we’re getting it done.



Elon Musk

I mean, I’m turning down.

 



Unidentified Company Representative

Yes, yes.

 

We’re great talent, like we find someone awesome, we bring them into the company.

And people shouldn’t believe we are turning people away.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

I mean, it’s a hot pond but we’re solving it.

And I think -- we still feel confident that 4680 will be the most competitive battery cell in the world.

 



Unidentified Company Representative

It’s the whole system around it, right?

 

It’s not necessarily a specific form factor.

It’s the attention to detail on how to bring costs out of the manufacturing process -- or remove processing steps.

 



Elon Musk

And all the way down from the mine to the cell.

 



Unidentified Company Representative

Yes, exactly.

 



Elon Musk

Many steps along the way.

 



Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.

 

And for those who watched the YouTube videos, like our on-site cathode facilities coming together, I’m really excited about that, which is a part of the plan that we discussed on Battery Day.



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

We’re also building lithium refinery.



Unidentified Company Representative

In Corpus Christi.

 

So, we’re making -- putting our money where our mouths are and all the various efforts that we discussed on Battery Day.

On the technical challenges and the ramp question, which is your first question of 4680, no ramp is ever easy even at the end when you’re 80% to the end, like it’s still very challenging to get to the end.

 

And that sort of leaning out of yields, the final cycle time to achieve target.

You mentioned logistics.

 

It’s not something that we’re specifically focused on, I guess, but eventually could be a problem as we’re talking about hundreds of gigawatt hours at different sites across the United States.

But I would never sit here and say we have no challenges remaining, but we’ve made a lot of progress reducing technical risk in many areas.

 

Cycle times have dramatically improved.

Yield has dramatically improved.

 

And just walking the line here in Texas, like Martin was walking it yesterday, made some comments to me.

You really see the acceleration around you.

 

And we’ve made a ton of simplifications moving from the Fremont factory to Texas, and it’s coming to play in speed of ramp here.

And of course, that’s on one line of many here in Texas.

 

So it’s not like factory to factory.

It’s a multiplication of both, simplicity and scale.

 

So yes, we’re excited about where it’s headed.



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

And I think, once we are fully integrated, I think we still do see a path to hold roughly $70 a kilowatt hour cell -- $70 per kilowatt hour cell, before any incentive.



Unidentified Company Representative

Before incentive.

 



Elon Musk

Before incentive.

 



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.



Toni Sacconaghi

I just wanted to follow up on the 4680 cells and where we are seeing them deployed today.

 

So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st?

Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin?

 

And is -- do you anticipate 4680 being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?

And how do you balance the need for 4680 across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in 2023?

 

And I have a follow-up, please.



Elon Musk

Okay.

 

The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.

Yes.

 

We are making Model Ys.

Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are 4680.

 

And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is 4680 Model Y?



Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.

 

10,000 miles.



Elon Musk

10,000 miles.

 

Pretty good.



Unidentified Company Representative

No problems yet.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

Structural pack.



Unidentified Company Representative

Structural pack.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

And yes, I mean -- and our output 4680 is growing exponentially.

But it’s worth bearing in mind like there are entire highly competitive companies that are very smart that all they do is make battery cells.

 

This is simply one segment of Tesla.

So, it’s not a total...

 



Unidentified Company Representative

No, there aren’t -- there are challenges still ahead that we have not yet surpassed.

 

No doubt.



Elon Musk

We don’t anticipate this being anything -- like Cybertruck or anything else.

 



Martin Viecha

Okay.

 

Thank you.

And the last question comes from William Stein from Truist.

 



William Stein

I guess, I’ll go at one that I asked last time, Elon, which is your expectation for the likelihood of commercial success in each of the three major AI endeavors.

 

FSD, sort of as imagined without a driver, the training computer and, of course, Optimus.



Elon Musk

We’ll achieve full self-driving full autonomy -- I look at that occurring is 100%.

 

And I think we’ll -- we’re almost there.

And then, of course, we’ve got to prove it to regulators and get the regulatory approvals, which is outside of our control.

 

But anyone who’s driving full self-driving cars -- has full self-driving Beta in the car, you can see the rate of improvement.

You can just experience for yourself that we are, in fact, getting there.

 

In fact, we almost are there.

And so, we’re probably -- achieving that 100%.

 

The Optimus, probably of that being a successful product, I think, it’s also extremely high given enough time, 100%.

Dojo, just maybe more of a question around Dojo, like can we be competitive with NVIDIA GPUs even as NVIDIA continues to rapidly evolve their GPUs.

 

So the jury is out on Dojo.

Dojo team, they can outperform NVIDIA for Neuralink training.

 

The jury’s out.

We will probably know -- I don’t know, next year, if that’s true or not.

 

But we think we’ll probably -- we think it’s -- this is -- the architecture of Dojo is the right architecture to win.

Yes.

 

It depends on how well we execute in that architecture.



Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

 

I think, unfortunately, it’s all the time that we have today.

So, thank you so much for your great questions, and look forward to talking to you in about three months from now.

 

Thank you, and have a good day.



Elon Musk

Thanks, everyone.

 ","Operator

Good evening.

 

My name is Briana, and I will be your conference operator for today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to PayPal Holdings' Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter 2022.

 

[Operator Instructions].

Thank you.

 

I would now like to turn the call over and introduce your host, Ms.

Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Vice President and Acting CFO.

 

Please go ahead.



Gabrielle Rabinovitch

Thank you, Briana.

 

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us.

Welcome to PayPal's earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2022.

 

Joining me today on the call is Dan Schulman, our President and CEO.

We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary.

 

This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website.

In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures.

Daniel Schulman

Thanks, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us.

 

I'm pleased to share that our results in the third quarter exceeded the guidance that we announced in August, marking the third consecutive quarter of delivering on our non-GAAP guidance.

Before reviewing our results and operational progress, I want to share two exciting developments that we believe will enhance our long-term strategic position.

 

First, I'm very pleased to announce that we are working with Apple to enhance our offerings for PayPal and Venmo merchants and consumers.

Leveraging Apple's Tap to pay on iPhone functionality, merchant customers in the U.S.

 

will soon be able to accept contactless debit or credit cards and mobile wallets including Apple Pay using an iPhone and the PayPal or Venmo iOS app.

This will allow PayPal's merchant base to easily use their iPhone as a mobile point of sale without the need for a dongle or other payment terminals.

 

We believe that this along with our other in-store initiatives will continue to accelerate our opportunity to seamlessly process payments in the physical world for our merchants.

We are also adding Apple Pay as a payment option in our unbranded checkout flows on our merchant platforms, including our PayPal Commerce Platform.

 

We are already in beta with several ecommerce platforms and merchants and anticipate a broader rollout in the coming months.

And next year, U.S.

 

customers will be able to add their PayPal and Venmo network-branded credit and debit cards to their Apple wallet and use them online and in-store wherever Apple Pay is accepted.

We anticipate this to be available in the first half of 2023 expanding the opportunity for our consumers to transact in-store.

 

This is a significant step forward in our relationship with Apple and we are excited to work closely with them to bring these new capabilities to our mutual customers.

Second, I'm excited to share that we continue to ramp pay with Venmo on Amazon and we plan to be fully ramped in time for peak holiday shopping.

 

This partnership is a reflection of Venmo scale and ubiquity, particularly in younger demographics.

And we look forward to working closely with Amazon on this new offering to drive results.

 

These relationships are aligned with our practice of working collaboratively with the major players across technology, and financial services to provide more choice and superior experiences to our mutual customers.

We are regarded by many as a partner of choice due to our scale and ubiquity, enabling us to create unique value for our customers.

 

And while we continue to enhance our strategic position, we remain focused on the operational initiatives that we shared last quarter.

Our efforts to reduce our cost structure and drive productivity gains are yielding strong results.

 

We remain on track to drive over $900 million in cost savings across our operating and transaction expenses this year, and at least $1.3 billion in cost savings next year.

This focus on efficiency, while continuing to invest in key growth areas is a high priority for us.

 

And we now expect to grow our year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 to approximately 22.5%.

We further anticipate that in 2023, we will deliver at least 100 basis points of operating margin expansion.

 

Let me now turn to our results.

Our revenues in the third quarter were $6.85 billion up 12% FXN and 11% spot, exceeding our guidance.

 

I'm pleased to say that eBay's migration to manage payments is behind us and will be inconsequential to our results in the fourth quarter.

Normalizing for eBay's migration to manage payments, our Q3 revenues grew approximately 13% on an FX neutral basis.

 

Non-GAAP EPS was $1.08 which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.13.

The cost containment actions we discussed on last quarter's call have slowed the growth of our year-over-year non-transaction related expenses to 4%.

 

We now expect that non-transaction related operating expenses for Q4 will be flat to slightly negative year-over-year.

And we are planning similar levels in 2023.

 

We are pleased with this execution particularly as we are driving reinvestment in key growth areas and continue to enhance our strategic position.

In the quarter, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion, up 37% year-over-year and an all-time record for us on an organic basis.

 

We added 2.9 million NNAs in Q3 and we expect to add another 3 million to 4 million NNAs in Q4.

I'm also very pleased to report that our transactions per active account in the quarter grew by a record 13% to 50.1x per year.

 

I'd like to spend a few moments discussing our progress on checkout.

With 35 million active merchant accounts and nearly 400 million active consumer accounts.

 

Our scale is like few others in the world and represents a substantial competitive advantage in a business that is driven by network effects.

In addition, we have built a high level of trust with our customers that drive significant preference to use our branded marks for online transactions.

 

We have continued to grow faster than overall ecommerce in Q3 with our total TPV up 14% FXN demonstrating the competitive differentiation and diversification of our global platform.

Within our PayPal branded checkout business, we believe we held or gained share in the United States, with PayPal branded checkout volumes up 4% year-over-year.

 

While there is not a standard proxy for ecommerce growth I'd point to Bank of America's credit and debit card volume data, which highlights 2% U.S.

ecommerce growth in Q3, a full 200 basis points below our 4% branded checkout growth rate.

 

We do expect we will continue to grow at or above the rate of ecommerce growth.

However, we know there are still substantial opportunities for us to pursue.

 

We have three major areas of focus for checkout.

First, elevating and optimizing the consumer experience.

 

Second, providing merchants with a seamless integration experience and a one stop shop for payments, and third, innovating new checkout solutions.

As consumers move towards mobile shopping, we are focused on creating the simplest mobile checkout experience possible.

 

These enhancements include allowing customers to check out without leaving the original merchant point of interaction.

For example, our recently updated Mobile SDK allows merchants to provide a seamless in app checkout experience.

 

We are also deploying the latest secure user authentication standard for our consumers enabling pass keys on all iOS devices to drive speed, simplicity, and conversion.

Our latest innovation is accelerated checkout, which will provide options with a robust solution and enables one click checkout.

 

This simplified consumer experience is achieved by leveraging vaulted credentials within our network to authenticate and approve customer purchases without the need for a password.

This enables seamless guest or account checkout experiences by removing obstacles, which currently cause abandoned sessions.

 

We are currently piloting this with several key partner platforms.

And we look forward to expanding this initiative as we move through 2023 and beyond.

 

For each segment of our Merchant base, we are implementing detailed processes, go-to-market plans and KPIs to measure our migration from legacy integrations.

Moving more of our merchant base to our latest and most advanced integrations will take time.

 

This will clearly be a multi-year initiative, but it represents a significant opportunity for us.

And we are putting resources, process and discipline in place to assure our execution.

 

We continue to see good momentum with our unbranded payment platforms.

We believe we are well-positioned to help merchants orchestrate payments, leveraging our insights and machine learning to route traffic between multiple PSPs resulting in increased approval and retention rates.

 

Braintree is a key growth area for us, and we will continue to invest to further enhance the platform.

Braintree TPV grew 38% in the quarter.

 

Our Braintree momentum is driven largely by recent merchant wins and share of wallet expansions.

And we recently signed an expanded agreement with Live Nation, which establishes Braintree as their primary card processor across the globe and includes an extended marketing partnership with PayPal and Venmo at some of Live Nation's largest festivals.

 

By now pay later continues to be a major asset to our checkout experience.

When PayPal was just ranked as the best overall Buy Now, Pay Later value proposition in the United States by the Wall Street Journal.

 

In the third quarter, we processed nearly $5 billion in volume up 157% year-over-year, with over 25 million consumers using our Buy Now, Pay Later services approximately 150 million times since launch.

As a result of this robust growth, we believe we have become the largest Buy Now, Pay Later providers in the world with a unique competitive advantage derived from our two-sided network.

 

Our upstream presentment continues to grow with over 280,000 merchants, displaying our Buy Now, Pay Later on their product pages.

The size of our active account base and the years of transaction data we have on our customers provides us with an additional competitive advantage from an underwriting perspective.

 

As of the end of Q3, our loss rates remain among the lowest in the industry with no observable deterioration to-date.

Venmo continues to be a significant asset in our portfolio with much untapped potential.

 

We have almost 90 million Venmo active accounts including 57 million monthly active accounts.

Total payment volume of Venmo grew 6%, while Venmo commerce volumes grew 150% in Q3.

 

We began to onboard charities to Venmo this quarter, which we expect will encourage more giving as we enter the holiday season.

As I shared earlier, we are obviously enthusiastic about our partnership with Amazon, and look forward to working with their team.

 

In October, we announced the launch of PayPal rewards, which unifies our Honey and PayPal rewards programs.

And customers now can earn, track, save and redeem cashback rewards and merchant offers in their PayPal app.

 

In addition, our customers can also combine the benefits of their existing card rewards and offers, allowing them to save even more.

PayPal rewards is ramping in time for peak holiday shopping.

 

And we have a robust roadmap to extend and enhance the program throughout 2023.

In closing, I'd like to underscore that we are confident we have turned a corner in our transformation.

 

We will continue to drive cost savings and streamline our processes to improve productivity, while investing to differentiate our value proposition, drive market share and deliver on our commitments.

Given a challenging macro environment, slowing ecommerce trends, and an unpredictable holiday shopping season, we were being appropriately prudent in our Q4 revenue guide.

 

At the same time, we are raising both our full year and Q4 EPS outlook and expect EPS growth in Q4 to be positive 6% to 8%.

And given our commitment, and focus on driving continued operational efficiency and earnings leverage, we plan to deliver no less than 15% non-GAAP EPS growth next year.

 

While there are a number of unknowns regarding the macro environment, we can largely control our spend, and its implication on earnings growth.

Of course, we're also focused on investing for growth.

 

And we are balancing efficient spend with continued investment to drive future top-line growth.

We are excited by the operational initiatives, product enhancements and new strategic partnerships that position PayPal in a substantially stronger position from when we started the year.

 

I want to thank the PayPal team for the work they do every day to support our merchants and consumers, live our values and drive our results.

And I'm also pleased that John Kim has recently joined us as Chief Product Officer.

 

He has deep technical and operational expertise with extensive experience overseeing product and engineering teams and has driven customer focused innovation at scale.

We are fortunate to have the chance to work with him to drive this next chapter in PayPal story.

 

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gabrielle.



Gabrielle Rabinovitch

Thanks, Dan.

 

I'd like to start off by thanking our customers, partners and global team for helping us to deliver a great quarter.

The strong results we're reporting today demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth.

 

Our teams are proving our ability to navigate a dynamic operating environment, while also staying focused on our key priorities.

We once again demonstrated our results, combining execution and focus with growth in our core business.

 

Our results reflect our operating discipline, diversification and resilience.

The power of PayPal is the scale of our global franchise.

 

Our investments in innovation are making us stronger.

And we're excited by what we see as we execute against our growth opportunities.

 

I share Dan's enthusiasm for our growing relationship with Apple and the rollout of pay with Venmo on Amazon.

We believe we will continue to extend and reinforce our leadership in payments.

 

And we are confident that our competitive positioning with unparalleled scale across our two-sided network will allow us to emerge from this period of economic uncertainty stronger.

We're proud of the quarter we delivered.

 

We surpassed the third quarter financial targets we shared with you in early August and delivered on our commitment of sequential acceleration in our revenue and earnings growth.

We're also on track to build upon our operating margin performance in Q3 to deliver a non-GAAP operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.

 

Our teams are energized by the progress we have made.

And by the increased operational rigor we're bringing to running our business and investing in our priorities.

 

At the same time, the macroeconomic backdrop continues to be complex and we're focused on taking an appropriately prudent approach to managing our business for profitable growth at scale.

This year, we will process nearly $1.4 trillion of payment volume an increase from $1.25 trillion last year, and a 25% compound annual growth rate from $288 billion in 2015.

 

At this massive scale, we are not immune to macro headwinds.

As we close out 2022 and prepare for the year ahead, we're intensely focused on doing everything within our control to anticipate and mitigate ongoing macro risks and drive robust earnings growth.

 

Given the breadth of our two sided platform, and our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we believe we are well positioned and have the levers available to successfully navigate an economic cycle.

We remain committed to meaningful non-GAAP operating margin expansion in 2023, and a significantly stronger non-GAAP earnings growth profile.

 

Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to highlight our third quarter performance.

As Dan mentioned, revenue increased 12.4% on a currency neutral basis, and 10.7% at spot to $6.85 billion.

 

With each of these metrics exceeding our guidance.

To dramatically strengthening dollar has been an increasing headwind as we move through the year, and we expect this condition to persist in the fourth quarter.

 

Transaction revenue grew 11.2% to $6.23 billion, driven primarily by Braintree and Venmo.

Other value-added services revenue grew 6.4% to $612 million.

 

This performance relative to last year resulted from higher interest income on customer store balances, offset by lower credit revenue as we [levied] [ph] higher than normal loan servicing fees.

In the third quarter U.S.

 

revenue grew 14.4%, while international revenue increased 6% at spot.

On a currency neutral basis International revenue increased 9.4% and excluding eBay 11.7%.

 

Additionally, eBay marketplaces revenue declined 38% to $145 million and represented 2% of our total revenue.

Our take rate performance was very strong with both transaction and total take rate improving approximately four basis points.

 

Transaction take rate was 1.85% and total take rate was 2.03%.

Both transaction and total take rate benefited from gains from foreign currency hedges recorded as international transaction revenue as well as Venmo monetization.

 

Interest income also benefited our total take rate.

Transaction expense came in at 89 basis points at the rate of TPV relative to 83 basis points at a rate last year.

 

This result was largely driven by the increase in the contribution of Braintree volume, which are predominantly card funded to our overall mix of payment volume.

To a lesser extent funding mix also contributed to higher transaction expenses from more normalized debit card usage relative to 2021.

 

Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was 8 basis points versus 9 basis points in Q3 last year.

In addition, credit losses were $113 million or 3 basis points as a rate of TPV.

 

As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2021, we released $63 million of credit reserves, which benefited transaction margin and operating margin performance in the prior period by 100 basis points.

We ended Q3 with $6.5 billion in gross receivables, reflecting sequential growth of 4%.

 

The growth in global pay later receivables was the largest driver of loan origination.

The mix of shorter duration originations from our pay later products and strong performance of our loan receivables portfolio resulted in a reserve coverage ratio of 7.4% compared to 7.3% last quarter, and 11.6% in third quarter last year.

 

Transaction margin dollars was 4%, a reversal from year-over-year declines in the first and second quarter of 2022.

Excluding the benefit from the reserve released last year transaction margin dollars increased 6%.

 

This quarter, we began seeing benefits to our transaction expense from leveraging our scale across the network ecosystem.

We expect this trend to continue in Q4 and into 2023.

 

In addition, we're making progress in rationalizing non-transaction related expense growth.

In the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis, these expenses grew 4% year-over-year relative to 17% growth last year, driving 180 basis points of operating leverage.

 

Non-GAAP operating income also grew 4% year-over-year to $1.53 billion.

Importantly, this is the first quarter since Q2 '21, in which we delivered operating income growth.

 

Our operating margin was 22.4% which was approximately two points better than our outlook provided at Q2 earnings.

We are particularly pleased by this operating margin outperformance and look forward to building on this track record of cost prudence as we enter 2023 and beyond.

 

For the third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $1.08 nearly 15% stronger than our outlook.

Pre-tax benefits in Q3 '21 of approximately $0.10 per share created a headwind to EPS growth.

 

Our outperformance relative to our expectations was predominantly driven by the actions we took to increase efficiencies within non-transaction related operating expenses and improved transaction loss performance.

We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $16.1 billion.

 

During the quarter we generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow, bringing year-to-date free cash flow to $4.1 billion.

Relative to last year, Q3 free cash flow grew 37%.

 

We consider our balance sheet and cash flow to be competitive differentiators, which provide us with significant optionality for value creation.

In the third quarter, we completed an additional $939 million in share repurchases.

 

Year-to-date, we have now returned $3.2 billion to shareholders representing 78% of the free cash flow we have generated.

Given our conviction in our business relative to its valuation today, and its long-term competitive advantages and ability to deliver sustainable value creation, we have taken a more aggressive approach to our capital return program this year.

 

We believe that share repurchase remains an optimal use of capital for our shareholders, while allowing us to retain the flexibility to continue investing opportunistically in our business.

We now expect to complete an additional $1 billion in share repurchases in the fourth quarter.

 

As I discussed during our earnings call last quarter, we've been assessing opportunities for additional credit externalization.

We have made progress on this initiative and are committed to secure an off-balance sheet funding for a portion of our global pay later portfolio next year.

 

Before I cover our guidance, I'd like to discuss the incremental disclosure that we are sharing this quarter to disaggregate our TPV.

In our investor update, we're providing additional information related to our volume mix, and how it has evolved over time.

 

We believe sharing this detail is helpful for investors to better understand our business trends.

I would now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year, and our preliminary thoughts for 2023.

 

First, some context on the trends we're seeing and how these are shaping our outlook.

As Dan mentioned, overall, we saw U.S.

 

ecommerce growing in the low single digits in Q3 with deceleration into the close of the quarter.

This trend persisted in October on our platform as well as in third party data, we have not seen the early start to the U.S.

 

online holiday season that we saw in 2021.

Our guidance contemplates holiday ecommerce ramping through November.

 

Overall, our expectations for holiday ecommerce are consistent with the recent spending forecasts from Adobe, MasterCard and Salesforce with growth in the low single digits.

We are also closely monitoring channel mix between in-store and online as well as the mix of services and good spending.

 

From a market perspective the U.S.

continues to outperform international and we are seeing weaker performance in the U.K., our second largest market.

 

These factors combined with a broader macro trends have been incorporated into our revised outlook.

We are lowering our full year currency neutral revenue expectations by 1-point and at the midpoint raising our non-GAAP EPS expectations by $0.16.

 

Given the current uncertainty in the global macro environment, we believe this is an appropriately sensible and prudent approach to our revenue outlook.

That said, our earnings guidance reflects the resilience and power of our franchise.

 

In raising our EPS outlook again, we're demonstrating our control over operating expenses, the diversification of our business and the benefits from scale to our operating model.

We believe that our ability to raise our earnings guidance in this environment is especially distinguishing relative to other public company guidance we've seen for Q4.

 

For the full year, we now expect revenue to grow approximately 10% on a currency neutral basis, and approximately 8.5% at spots.

For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth of approximately 9% on a currency neutral basis, and approximately 7% at spot.

 

We believe our Q4 and full year revenue growth guidance is strong given our scale and the macro backdrop.

We also expect to deliver non-GAAP operating margin of at least 21% this year.

 

For the first three quarters of 2022, our operating margin has declined year-over-year.

Importantly in the fourth quarter, we expect this trend to inflect and to deliver non-GAAP operating margin expansion.

 

Our guidance contemplates Q4 operating margin of approximately 22.5%.

In addition, we're raising non-GAAP EPS to $4.07 to $4.09 for the year.

 

As we noted entering the year, discrete tax benefits and reserve releases last year in the aggregate benefited 2021 non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.54 and are a headwind to our EPS growth profile this year.

Based on our expectations for revenue and operating margin in the fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP EPS of approximately $1.18 to $1.20.

 

We expect to finish 2022 in a stronger position than we started it, with greater operating discipline and focus.

Dan and I are pleased with our improving execution and we're confident there'll be room for continued improvement.

 

However, with our most important weeks in the holiday season ahead of us, as well as ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe it is too early to provide a detailed outlook for 2023 on this call.

That said, as we're planning for the year ahead, our framework currently includes the following assumptions.

 

First, that our overall volumes will continue to grow faster than ecommerce across our core markets, and that we will continue to take market share.

At the same time, we expect inflationary pressures, alongside slowing global growth to weigh on discretionary ecommerce spending, which could continue to be pressured in 2023.

 

Second, that we will deliver at least 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion next year an improvement from our 50-basis point commitment when we report our results last quarter.

And third, our commitment to drive solid growth and earnings per share.

 

Taken together, we believe that our cost savings initiatives and benefits from higher interest rates will enable us to deliver non-GAAP earnings growth of at least 15% next year.

We believe this outlook for next year contemplate a sufficiently wide range of revenue outcome.

 

We are firmly committed to executing on the operational initiatives we discussed last quarter and are highly confident that we will deliver on our 2023 framework.

Finally, from a capital allocation standpoint, we plan to take a similarly aggressive approach to share repurchases in 2023 as we have this year.

 

In closing, despite the many challenges of today's environment, we believe that we are well positioned to navigate the road ahead.

We cannot have more confidence in our people and in the priorities we're executing against.

 

We are just beginning to scale several of our newer consumer and merchant experiences and work with several important strategic partners in the ecosystem.

For our shareholders, we continue to achieve significant growth while returning capital in the form of share repurchases.

 

And we're confident that our earnings power and strong free cash flow generation will allow us to continue to invest in our business and extend our leadership position.

We are completely focused on delivering for all of our stakeholders and look forward to updating you on our progress.

 

With that I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for questions.

Brianna, please go ahead.

 
Operator

[Operator Instructions].

 

Your first question comes from the line of James Fossett with Morgan Stanley.

Your line is open.

 



James Fossett

Great, thanks.

 

Exciting announcements for sure with Apple, et cetera.

Just wondering, on the margins, though, can you talk a little bit about how you're approaching next year, obviously, there's -- as you indicated, Gabrielle, there's a big range of potential scenarios, especially around revenue, but you seem fairly confident in your ability to deliver that 100 basis points of margin expansion, which is a little more than we had modeled.

 

So you can talk about, like, what's going into that, like, what levers you can pull to make sure you can deliver that and how that translates into that 15% EPS growth.

Thanks.

 



Daniel Schulman

Hey, James.

 

It’s Dan.

I will start off and then maybe Gabs can fill in around the edges here.

 

First of all, we do feel quite confident in our ability to raise our EPS for the year.

And then on top of that higher total, generated at least 15%, EPS growth, which gets you to about as a first step for us $4.70 next year.

 

And this is really being driven by being taken very prudent approach to what could happen next year, from a macroeconomic perspective, there are a wide range of scenarios on that, and everybody has an opinion.

But we think it's prudent to plan for a difficult economic cycle and have our cost structure, be in line with that, so that we can deliver robust EPS growth.

 

Our cost and productivity initiatives are so well underway.

I'm really pleased with the execution that we've had over the last several quarters.

 

We've been anticipating a difficult economic environment, the team's taken a lot of action across non-transaction related OpEx.

As we said, in our remarks, we expect in the fourth quarter, that's going to be flat, and probably slightly negative, as we look ahead, and then as you look into 2023, we see no reason why it will come off of those levels of being flat, to slightly negative.

 

If you think about it, our non-transaction OpEx has traditionally been in the mid-single digits for a long time, during the pandemic that jumped up to 17% in 2020, and about 20% in 2021.

So we have plenty of headcount, our headcount are going to be down at the end of this year from where we started at the beginning.

 

We have a lot of efficiencies, as our processes get better and better.

We are clearly leveraging our scale with our suppliers as well as whether it be our network partners, or others on transaction related expenses.

 

And we feel very good about delivering at least 100 basis points of operating margin improvement next year.

By the way, at the same time, investing in our high growth, high conviction areas, checkout digital wallets and Braintree.

 

We think this is a time where market share leaders get stronger.

We want to take advantage of this environment that we're in.

 

We are already seeing some of the investments we're making in those areas, pay real dividends and our ability to satisfy our customers.

And we think this is an opportunity for us to take share going forward.

 

We're in a rising interest rate environment, that's a tailwind for us for many of our competitors, it's a headwind on and we just think there's opportunities for us to operate more efficiently and effectively and invest and continue to take market share.

So really pleased with the focus and the commitment from the team making real progress on the cost side and the productivity front.

 

And we'll continue to do so as we go into next year.

Next question operator.

 
Operator

Yes.

 

Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.

Your line is now open.

 



Jason Kupferberg

Thank you, guys.

 

I wanted to talk about the top-line outlook for Q4 currency neutral.

We're looking at 9% revenue growth.

 

I know last quarter, we were thinking more like 14%, obviously linked to the software TPV outlook.

Can you just walk us through perhaps pieces of that bridge?

 

What you thought that last quarter versus what you're thinking now for Q4, given the context of the softer macro?

Thank you.

 



Gabrielle Rabinovitch

Yes.

 

You bet, Jason.

So you're right.

 

We took down our full year revenue guidance by about a point and at the same time, of course, raised our EPS at the midpoint by $0.16.

We had a strong Q3, and obviously, we delivered on all of our commitments.

 

But at the end of the quarter, we started to see some slowing and that came right at the at the very end.

In October, in addition, we didn't see the early start to the holiday season that we've seen in 2021.

 

And so we brought down our internal forecast for U.S.

ecommerce growth, commensurately with that.

 

And so, in the middle of the year, we were thinking about U.S.

ecommerce growth for the fourth quarter and the mid-single digits, that's now come down to low singles.

 

That's pretty consistent with what we see from other third parties.

And that really is the predominant driver of the change in our guidance.

 

Now, in conjunction with that similar to earlier this year, when we took down some of our expectations around initiatives in conjunction with a lower growth environment, we've done the same.

And so that's also contributing to the 9% FX neutral expectation on Q4.

 

But of course, we're raising EPS overall.

And in the quarter, we expect to deliver about 75 basis point of Op margin expansion.

 

So we continue to deliver on our efficiencies, despite the slower growth environment.



Daniel Schulman

I think you'll also be seeing any report that comes out on the macroeconomic environment, reaching all times high.

 

The inflation report in the Euro Zone was not great.

And you're seeing in countries like the Netherlands, which is so conservative, a 17% inflation rate, U.K., which is our second largest market, is really suffering.

 

And our view is that we're still going into winter, energy costs are going to go up.

And the low-end income levels and middle-income levels are beginning to cut back on their discretionary spend, they're spending so much more on food, on energy, on gas, on rent.

 

And we're beginning to see that impact those segments of the market.

The high end of the market, by the way, still spending quite freely.

 

And we're seeing that also in our results.

The other thing is, we did expect quite a number of live to site implementations on Braintree in the fourth quarter, almost a full point of growth that are being pushed into next year.

 

So we'll capture that revenue, we just won't capture it this quarter.

So I think as Gab said, there's certain things we can control, that is our expenses, where we're investing, how we're doing in those investments.

 

And there, I think the team is doing an excellent job.

And there's certain things like the macro environment that we can't control.

 

But we need to be ready in a wide range of scenarios.

And that's what we're laying out for you, firm commitment around at least 15%, EPS growth and operating margin expansion and continued investment in our high growth, high conviction areas.

 



Jason Kupferberg

All makes sense.

 

Thanks, guys.



Daniel Schulman

Yep.

Your next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird.

 

Your line is open.



Colin Sebastian

Thanks very much.

 

Obviously, it's a fluid environment.

But maybe following up the last question, I think it'd be helpful to know for context, how you're thinking about the overall ecommerce environment into next year.

 

How that impacts the 2023 framework and including the underlying volume, the revenue growth assumptions that you have to get to those targets.

Thank you.

 



Daniel Schulman

So let me start off and Gabs can come in.

 

So first of all, Colin, I think it's a little bit too soon to have strong visibility into what 2023 will look like.

Typically in a quarter, when you're a third of the way through it, you have pretty good visibility into what's going to happen in the quarter.

 

But in the fourth quarter, that's not the case.

It's really all about the holiday season.

 

And what happens in five- or six-week, period, that's still ahead of us.

But based on what we're seeing right now, based on external reports, based on our conversations with other ecommerce players you saw, another very large ecommerce player take down their revenues in the fourth quarter that we think that ecommerce is going to be pretty muted in the fourth quarter.

 

And right now, we are not planning that that comes back for any reason, as we look into 2023.

I think baseline ecommerce growth will be subdued.

 

But I fully expect that we will outpace it.

We've got quite a number of Braintree live to site with very large merchants coming up.

 

Our checkout and digital wallet improvements are quite strong right now.

And I'm really pleased with the indications from those initiatives.

 

Obviously, Amazon, we'll see what happens with that but we have a lot of hope for that.

And our deal with Apple will certainly be meaningful over at least the medium term on that.

 

So still too early to call, we're going to be very conservative on our top-line assumptions, but we're going to build a ton of resilience into our model.

We will adjust to potential lower growth environments, we can keep our OpEx very well controlled.

 

We've demonstrated that now and will continue to enable operating margin expansion next year so.

And if the macro picture gets better, these numbers can improve dramatically, but we're anticipating a difficult economic cycle and preparing for that so that we can invest and deliver robust EPS growth at the same time.

 



Colin Sebastian

Thank you very much.

 



Daniel Schulman

Yep.

Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.

 

Your line is now open.



Darrin Peller

Hey, thanks, guys.

 

Look, it's really helpful to have the volume breakdown by PayPal Braintree more, I know you said I think you said 4% core PayPal growth.

And you're saying you're expecting that it'll be in line with the market.

 

If you could just touch on the assumptions and drivers of PayPal core engagement growth and what you can do there.

It obviously looks like you're making progress around initiatives like passkey or the Venmo, Amazon partnership or obviously Apple.

 

All that should help I assume on the checkout experience, but maybe we can have some more color on how much room there is to improve that experience and what that can mean.



Daniel Schulman

Yes, sure.

 

So, I will dive really quickly into both checkout and a little bit on what we're seeing on digital wallet.

So as you know, Dan, we're already the leader in branded checkout, I mean, we have 8x the footprint of the next closest digital wallet.

 

Consumers are twice as likely to spend online when they see the PayPal button, 80% of the 1500 largest online retail retailers across the U.S.

in Europe, except us in our [half rate] [ph] right now is 600 basis points above the market average like for every 100 transactions, PayPal is going to approve six more than traditional card networks.

 

But obviously, as we've talked about many times, we can do a lot more here and one, we've improved customer perceived latency by 40%.

In the last 12 months, our uptime and availability has gone up by another nine, we are approaching five nines of availability.

 

And when we're doing in -- our early indications from in app with the Mobile SDK, is that conversion rates increase between 3% and 10%.

Again, it's early days on that but imagine how significant that improvement is.

 

On the authentication side, passkeys is a very big deal.

Passkeys are going to be accepted.

 

Not just with Apple, we're integrating through iOS on passkeys initially.

But Google and Microsoft are also enabling passkeys.

 

And that basically enables authentication through biometrics fully embedded into the OS, it eliminates the need for like weak or reused credentials.

It removes the frustration of having to remember, password.

 

And like one of our recent surveys, like 44% of consumers have abandoned an online purchase due to a password issue.

So that passkey could be a very meaningful piece of conversion uplift for us.

 

And then of course, we're moving into [voting] [ph] and accelerated checkout.

And I've mentioned this already on our digital wallet stats, but it's up 50% of our base now plus is using our digital wallets that's up over 13% year-over-year, we're seeing much reduced churn on that 25% to 33%, 50% greater ARPU, 60% more checkout transactions, we're seeing a lot of our new products in the wallet gained a lot of traction.

 

I mean, savings is early, it's got a 3% APY.

But we're seeing a 20% lift in ARPA for those come into our savings program, 30% lift in checkout.

 

And even things like just like our new three-two card, because cards are important part of our strategy, that's off to an incredibly strong start.

We've acquired more accounts in the first six months of that launch, than we did in the previous 22 months with our 2% cashback offer.

 

So a lot of things to be excited about in terms of what we can do with our initiatives.

And that's why we're investing heavily in them, as well as returning operating margin performance and EPS performance to our investors.

 



Darrin Peller

Understood.

 

Thanks, Dan.



Daniel Schulman

Yep.

 

You bet.

Your next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.

 

Your line is now open.



Lisa Ellis

Hey, good afternoon, guys.

 

Good to hear your voices.

Dan, I just wanted to follow up on the Apple-related announcements that you made or highlighted on the call, certainly some good progress there.

 

Can you talk a bit more about what you think that unlocks for PayPal in terms of better serving both your merchants and your consumers?

Are there any aspects of this relationship that you could think could be more impactful perhaps over time, like where could it go?

 

And then also could talk a little bit about how that relationship dynamic is?

How collaborative this relationship is with Apple?

 

Thank you.



Daniel Schulman

Yes.

 

Well, first of all, I think the agreement is quite important, strategically, and our two companies have been working on that together for quite some time.

I think there are three areas that this really helps to unlock.

 

I mean, first of all, enabling our merchants to use their iPhone without any incremental dongle or point of sale terminal around that all they need to do if they have a business profile on Venmo, or PayPal has given us three pieces of information, their mobile phone number, their birth date, and either their social security number or their tax ID, that's it, and then they're set up to receive payments in the offline world.

And our payment rate there is 2.29% plus $0.09, that is a really competitive rate versus others in the market.

 

And we think this can be really especially significant for the millions of customers that have Venmo business profiles and allow us to compete aggressively in an omnichannel world.

And so I think there's a big unlock on that.

 

Second, adding Apple to our unbranded flows.

As you know, Apple's already on Braintree in our unbranded flows, but that's just going to make us well more competitive.

 

As we go out and sell PayPal commerce platform further down into middle market and smaller businesses.

It enables us to sell PayPal commerce platform more completely it enables us to offer more choice to our merchants, which is something we've been focused on for years and years now.

 

And it also enables the very best integration of our PayPal branded and Venmo branded checkout buttons.

And then, finally, the ability for our consumers to add their PayPal and Venmo credit and debit card into Apple Pay in the U.S., for the use that anywhere Apple Pay is accepted, is probably a bigger deal than most people realize.

 

We've been doing this with Google Pay for quite some time.

And we've seen, for instance, that Google Pay users in Germany, when they add their PayPal credentials there, there's a 20% increase in their branded checkout transactions.

 

And so they also have the ability to create temporary digital cards that can even allow us to bring our Buy Now, Pay Later from branded checkout online, to everywhere consumer shops.

So I think there's a lot of really nice unlocks.

 

Apple and PayPal.

I've been working closely on this.

 

We're both excited to put these into the market, and dedicate resources to ensuring that they're successful, and just create a better value proposition for our mutual customers.



Lisa Ellis

Terrific, thank you.

 



Daniel Schulman

Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.

 

Your line is now open.



Tien-Tsin Huang

Thanks, Dan and Gabs.

 

Just any more clarity on the -- at least part of the 1.3 billion in cost efficiency next year is, I'm just curious if that's more likely to come from cost cutting or maybe less investing?

How quickly also, can you pull the levers to deliver on the 15%?

 

Thanks.



Gabrielle Rabinovitch

Yes, you bet.

 

So when we talked last quarter about driving at least $1.3 billion in cost savings next year, nearly half of that was coming on the transaction expense side with the other half coming from non-transaction related OpEx.

I'd say in addition to thinking we can do more, I think the balance weighs more in favor of non-transactional related OpEx than it does TE at this point.

 

And some of that's based on the fact that with a slightly lower growth environment.

Some of the benefits that we derive on the TE side are really volume based in nature.

 

And those volume expectations come in a bit, we would be driving more on the non-transactional related OpEx side.

That said, I think we see a lot of room to go in terms of our initiatives there.

 

And so just sort of taking a step back.

Last year, our non-transactional related OpEx grew by 20%.

 

That was on top of about 17% growth in 2020, over 2019.

And so this year, we're spending about $2.5 billion more in our non-transaction related OpEx buckets than we did in 2019.

 

And we see an opportunity to be a lot more productive and drive more savings there.

And so you'll see this year some marketing dollars coming down that came down again in Q3 about 1%, after coming down considerably more than that, in Q2.

 

We will end up the year with low single-digit, non-transactional related OpEx growth and I’m expecting next year will do better than that.

I'd expect it to be closer to flat, if not a decline year-on-year.

 

So we're looking for the opportunities we can to continue to drive operating margin expansion even in a lower growth environment.

And we think you know that the savings we're finding are really sustainable.

 

And it's a lot more about productivity and using our scale to benefit us.

And so, we think we emerge from this environment much stronger as a result of the work that we're doing.

 



Tien-Tsin Huang

Understood.

 

Now that's all useful and thanks, got to you say thank you for Slide six, including the CAGR stuff.

That's great to have.

 

Is that a one timer and I'll jump off?

Thanks, in terms of disclosure.

 



Gabrielle Rabinovitch

We will continue to provide updates.

 

I don't know that we're committed to doing it on a quarterly basis, but we'll continue to update on the mix of our TPV as it's quite important to understanding the performance of the business.

We'll take the next question.

 
Operator

We have time for one last question from David Togut with Evercore ISI.

 

Your line is now open.



David Togut

Thanks so much for squeezing me in.

 

You've announced a number of new omnichannel initiatives whether it be the announcements with Apple today.

The rollout recently of PayPal Zettle terminal in the U.S.

 

and of course continue to expansion of your BNPL products.

Can you help us think about what all the omnichannel initiatives might mean over time for revenue?

 

And then, sort of broadly, what are the costs associated with expanding omnichannel?

You've talked about freeing up investment dollars from your cost reduction initiatives.

 

Thanks so much.



Daniel Schulman

Yes.

 

I'll start on that, David.

So BNPL is an integral part of our checkout strategy.

 

We know if we go into upfront presentment, Buy Now, Pay Later, somebody puts us on their product pages, as opposed to check out that our share of checkout goes up quite dramatically.

And as you saw, and as you heard, from me, it's growing by leaps and bounds.

 

We're approaching 300,000, upstream presentment.

And we're one of the top players in any market two years after launch 150 million different loans.

 

At over, by the way 2.2 million unique merchants.

And what I didn't say in my script is, it drives a halo spend of greater than 20%.

 

And 90 plus of that is incremental to us.

And so not only do we have, a great value proposition, but we have a real competitive advantage in knowing our customers, 90% of the people that use Buy Now, Pay Later, we have history on.

 

And so our loss rates remain low and stable.

And today we're live in 8 markets.

 

As I mentioned, when Lisa asked her question, we think that the ability to take Buy Now, Pay Later, anywhere you want to shop, whether that be online or in store, is a really exciting part, the evolution of Buy Now, Pay Later, as part of being able to put a branded debit or credit card, PayPal, or Venmo branded debit card into Apple Pay.

We can also provision a digital, Buy Now, Pay Later, for somebody going in stores, they can pay in-store using one of our Buy Now, Pay Later solutions.

 

And we are also now linking our card strategy, which is a very important part of our in-store.

We are moving away from going heavy into QR and doing much more with cards.

 

But imagine paying for something in store and then coming back into your PayPal app and deciding okay, I paid for that.

But now I want to pay for that in four installments or split that payment with rewards or fiat currency.

 

And so we're really trying to imagine Buy Now, Pay Later as being fully omni as a capability.

And we think that will unlock quite a bit for us as we look forward.

 



David Togut

Thank you.

 



Daniel Schulman

I think thank you, David for that.

 

And I want to thank everybody for the time, for your great questions.

We look forward to speaking with all of you soon.

 

And again, thanks for your time.

Take care and bye-bye.

This concludes today's conference call.

 

You may now disconnect.","Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

 

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase’s Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.

This call is being recorded.

 

Your line will be muted for the duration of the call.

We will now go live to the presentation.

 

Please stand by.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase’s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum.

 

Mr.

Barnum, please go ahead.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Thank you very much.

 

Good morning, everyone.

As always, the presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.

 

Starting on page 1.

The Firm reported net income of $9.7 billion, EPS of $3.12 on revenue of $33.5 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 18%.

 

The only significant item this quarter was discretionary net investment securities losses in Corporate of $959 million as a result of repositioning the portfolio by selling U.S.

Treasuries and mortgages.

 

Our strong results this quarter reflect the resilience of the franchise in a dynamic environment.

Touching on a few highlights.

 

We had a record third quarter -- we had record third quarter revenue in Markets of $6.8 billion, we ranked number one in retail deposit share based on FDIC data, and credit is still healthy with net charge-offs remaining low.

On page 2, we have more detail.

 

Revenue of $33.5 billion was up $3.1 billion or 10% year-on-year.

Excluding the net investment securities losses, it was up 13%.

 

NII ex Markets was up $5.7 billion or 51%, driven by higher rates.

NIR ex Markets was down $3.2 billion or 24%, largely driven by lower IB fees and the securities losses.

 

And Markets revenue was up $502 million or 8% year-on-year.

Expenses of $19.2 billion were up $2.1 billion or 12% year-on-year, driven by higher structural costs and investments.

 

And credit costs of $1.5 billion included net charge-offs of $727 million.

The net reserve build of $808 million included a $937 million build in Wholesale, reflecting loan growth and updates to the Firm’s macroeconomic scenarios, partially offset by $150 million release in Home Lending.

 

On the balance sheet and capital on page 3.

We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.5%, up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions, partially offset by the impact of AOCI.

 

RWA was down approximately $23 billion quarter-on-quarter, with growth in lending more than offset by continued active balance sheet management and lower market risk RWA.

Given our results this quarter, we are well positioned to meet our CET1 targets of 12.5% in the fourth quarter and 13% in the first quarter of 2023.

 

These current targets include a 50 basis-point buffer over the growing regulatory requirements, which provides flexibility over the coming quarters.

To conclude on capital, with the future increases in our risk-based requirements, SLR will no longer be our binding capital constraint.

 

So, we announced the call of $5.4 billion in press this quarter and issued $3.5 billion in sub debt to rebalance our capital stack.

Now, let’s go to our businesses, starting on page 4.

 

Before I review CCB’s performance, let me provide you with an update on the health of U.S.

consumers and small businesses based on our data.

 

Nominal spend is still strong across both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories, with combined debit and credit spend up 13% year-on-year.

Cash buffers remain elevated across all income segments.

 

However, with spending growing faster than income, we are seeing a continued decrease in median deposits year-on-year, particularly in the lower income segments.

And not surprisingly, small business owners are increasingly focused on the risks and the economic outlook.

 

Now, moving to financial results.

This quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.3 billion on revenue of $14.3 billion, which was up 14% year-on-year.

 

In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates.

Deposits were up 10% year-on-year and down 1% quarter-on-quarter.

 

We ranked number one in retail deposit share based on FDIC data, up 60% year-on-year, making us the fastest-growing among the top 20 banks.

And we are now number one in L.A., in addition to New York and Chicago, making us top ranked in the three largest markets.

 

Client investment assets were down 10% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by flows, while lending revenue was down 34% year-on-year on lower production margins and volume.

Moving to Card & Auto.

 

Revenue was up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher card NII, partially offset by lower auto lease income.

Card outstandings were up 18%.

 

And while revolving balances were up 15%, driven by strong net new account originations and growth in revolving balances per account, they still remain slightly below pre-pandemic levels.

And in Auto, originations were $7.5 billion, down 35%, due to lack of vehicle supply and rising rates.

 

Expenses of $8 billion were up 11% year-on-year, driven by the investments we’re making in technology, travel, marketing and branches.

In terms of actual credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $529 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $679 million, which were up $188 million year-on-year, largely driven by loan growth in card as well as a reserve release of $150 million in Home Lending.

 

Card delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic levels, though we continue to see gradual normalization.

Next, the CIB on page 5.

 

CIB reported net income of $3.5 billion on revenue of $11.9 billion.

Investment Banking revenue of $1.7 billion was down 43% year-on-year.

 

IB fees were down 47% versus a strong third quarter last year.

We maintained our number one rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.1%.

 

In Advisory, fees were down 31%, reflecting lower announced activity this year.

Underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market volatility, resulting in fees down 40% for debt and down 72% for equity.

 

In terms of the fourth quarter outlook, we expect to be down versus a very strong prior year.

And while our existing pipeline is healthy, conversion will, of course, depend on market conditions.

 

Lending revenue of $323 million was up 32% versus the prior year, driven by higher NII on loan growth.

Moving to Markets.

 

Revenue was $6.8 billion, up 8% year-on-year.

Fixed income was up 22%, as elevated volatility drove strong client activity in the macro franchise, partially offset by a less favorable environment in securitized products.

 

Equity Markets were down 11% against a record third quarter last year.

This quarter saw relative strength in derivatives, lower balances in prime and lower cash revenues on lower block activity.

 

Payments revenue was $2 billion, up 22% year-on-year.

Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 41%, and the year-on-year growth was driven by higher rates and growth in fees.

 

Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was relatively flat year-on-year.

Expenses of $6.6 billion were up 13% year-on-year, largely driven by compensation.

 

Credit costs were $513 million, driven by a net reserve build of $486 million.

Moving to Commercial Banking on page 6.

 

Commercial Banking reported net income of $946 million.

Record revenue of $3 billion was up 21% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower Investment Banking revenue.

 

Gross Investment Banking revenue of $761 million was down 43% year-on-year, driven by reduced capital markets activity.

Expenses of $1.2 billion were up 14% year-on-year.

 

Deposits were down 6% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by attrition of non-operating balances, while our core operating balances have shown stability as payment volumes continue to be robust.

Loans were up 13% year-on-year and 4% sequentially.

 

C&I loans were up 7% sequentially, reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver utilization.

CRE loans were up 2% sequentially, driven by lower prepayment activity in commercial term lending and real estate banking.

 

Finally, credit costs were $618 million, predominantly driven by a net reserve build of $587 million, while net charge-offs remained low.

And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7.

 

Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.2 billion, with pretax margin of 36%.

For the quarter, revenue of $4.5 billion was up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by deposits and loans on higher margins and balances, largely offset by reductions in management fees linked to this year’s market declines.

 

Expenses of $3 billion were up 10% year-on-year, driven by compensation, including investments in our private banking advisory teams, technology and asset management initiatives.

For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $12 billion across fixed income, equities and alternatives.

 

AUM of $2.6 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8 trillion were down 13% and 7% year-on-year, respectively, driven by lower market levels, partially offset by continued net inflows.

And finally, loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 6% sequentially, driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client flows.

 

Turning to Corporate on page 8.

Corporate reported a net loss of $294 million.

 

Revenue was a net loss of $302 million compared to a net loss of $1.3 billion last year.

NII was $792 million, up $1.8 billion year-on-year, driven by the impact of higher rates.

 

NIR was a loss of $1.1 billion, down $852 million, primarily due to the securities losses I mentioned upfront.

And expenses of $305 million were higher by $125 million year-on-year.

 

Next, the outlook on page 9.

Going forward, we will also provide guidance for total firm-wide NII.

 

For the fourth quarter, we expect it to be approximately $19 billion, implying full year 2022 NII of approximately $66 billion.

And we expect NII ex Markets for the fourth quarter to also be about $19 billion, implying that we expect Markets NII to be around zero, which brings the full year to about $61.5 billion.

 

While we’re not giving 2023 NII guidance today, you will recall that at Investor Day, we talked about a fourth quarter 2022 NII ex Markets run rate of $66 billion, with potential upside for the full year 2023.

Today’s guidance for the fourth quarter of this year implies an approximate run rate of $76 billion.

 

And from this much higher level, we would now expect some modest decline for the full year 2023.

In addition, there’s quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding the trajectory of key drivers, including rates, deposit reprice and loan growth.

 

So, keep both of those things in mind as you update the 2023 estimates in your models.

Moving to expenses.

 

Our outlook remains unchanged.

And as it relates to the card net charge-off rate, we now expect the full year rate to be approximately 1.5%, below our previous expectations.

 

So to wrap up, we are happy with the strong diversified performance of the quarter as we continue to navigate an environment of elevated uncertainty.

With that, I will turn it over to Jamie for some additional remarks.

 



Jamie Dimon

Jeremy, thank you very much.

 

Hello, everybody.

I just wanted to give you a little more insight to how we’re looking at capital and interest rates a little bit.

 

So capital planning, we’re very comfortable with the earnings power of this company, which, you can see, is enormous and the margins and the returns.

And more importantly than that is we’re growing franchise value, I think, all around the Firm.

 

And in most areas, we’re up in market share, in a few areas, we’re not, and of course, that disappoints us.

But the earnings power gives us a lot of confidence that we’ll get over that 13% in the first quarter.

 

But we always have to keep in mind the volatility and a bunch of other things.

So, we know we have to deal with Basel IV.

 

We don’t know when and how this is going to be, and any change in GSIB such as an uncertainty in back of our mind.

AOCI: AOCI was traditionally countercyclical, but this kind of environment is more pro-cyclical.

 

So, think of it as rates go up another 100 basis points, that’s $4 billion, easily can handle it just in the back of our mind.

CECL: CECL already incorporates a percent of what we think the adverse consequences might be.

 

But obviously, if the environment gets worse, we’ll have to add to reserves.

And/or if we change our outlook, meaning that we think the chance of adverse events are higher, we’ll change our reserves.

 

Put in the back of your mind that if unemployment goes to 5% or 6%, you’re probably talking about $5 billion or $6 billion over the course of a couple of quarters.

Again, easy to handle, not a big deal.

 

It just doesn’t affect capital a little bit.

And then, RWA management, I mean, I think we’re showing that we can easily manage RWA and drive it down in some areas and up in other areas and stuff like that.

 

With that what I would say, a very limited financial effect.

And the way you should look at this is, we don’t tell commercial bank or investment bank don’t get new business, don’t serve your clients.

 

So we’re serving clients the way we always do, and you see the loan book growing in a lot of areas, but there are some discretionary things which barely affect us.

So, we’re not putting -- conforming mortgage on the balance sheet, whether we originate them or whether correspondents originate the most part, because it makes very low sense to do that in the balance sheet, and we make other choices.

 

And so we’ve got a lot of tools to manage it.

Obviously, with the capital requirements going up, we’re going to find ways to reduce RWA.

 

I’m talking about over years strategically, I think without affecting our basic franchises.

Interest rates: I think the way to look at it is we’re fairly neutral at this point, interest rates going up or down.

 

Jeremy said the $19 billion, please do not annualize that.

There are a lot of uncertainties today.

 

And I’m just going to mention a few.

We’re not worried about them.

 

It’s not going to change things dramatically, but does change things.

What’s going to be QT’s effect on deposits?

 

How much deposit migration you’re going to have in this new technological environment?

And there are pluses and minus from that.

 

And of course, there are lags.

There are lags in consumer.

 

There can be some lags in treasury services.

There can be some lags in commercial banking.

 

So it’s just on the back of the mind, we’re going to kind of actively manage that.

And the other thing I want to point out is that taking investment securities losses for the most part, it could be want to sell our rich securities and replacement chief securities.

 

We don’t want to be locked into something we think will get worse and not take a chance to buy something that we think will get better.

So, you might expect to see that taking place now.

 

There may be some securities loss in the future, we can do that.

We’re not doing -- we can do this to manage interest rate exposure.

 

But for the most part, we can do that with swaps to or other things.

We just do it the most efficient and effective way.

 

I want the people that manage these portfolios to know that we can sell things we don’t want to own and buy things that we do want to own.

And other than that, we think it was a very, very good strong quarter across the board.

 

And I guess, we’ll open for questions now.



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

Thanks, Jamie.

Let’s go ahead and open up for questions.

And the first question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.



Ken Usdin

Hi, thanks a lot.

 

Good morning.

I just wanted to follow up on the NII and the deposit side to Jamie’s comments there.

 

Obviously, one of the toughest uncertainties is to understand how we think about flows and mix and beta.

So just starting to see it, it looks like in terms of deposit costs starting to increase.

 

So, how do you think about it now in this new environment, where we might go to 4.5, maybe higher in terms of how betas might act over the course of this cycle as compared to any prior cycles and previous thoughts?

Thanks.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

Thanks, Ken.

Good morning.

 

Okay.

So, at Investor Day, you’ll recall that Jen said that we expected betas to be low this cycle as they were in the prior cycle, which was a low beta cycle by historical standards.

 

And what we’re now seeing, as we see the rate hikes come through and we see the deposit rate paid develop, is that we’re seeing realized betas being even lower than the prior cycle, just through the actuals.

And the question was why is that?

 

And it’s, of course, we don’t really know, but plausible theories include the speed of the hikes, which probably means that some of this is lagged, but also the fact that the system is more better positioned from a liquidity perspective than in prior cycles.

So, as we look forward, we know that lags are significant right now.

 

We know that at some point, that will start to come out.

Obviously, in wholesale, they come out much faster.

 

That’s probably starting to happen now.

But the exact timing of how that develops is going to be very much a function of the competitive environment in the marketplace for deposits, and we’ll see how that plays out.

 



Ken Usdin

Got it.

 

Okay.

And then just the second follow-up on Jamie’s points about, like, okay, if things do look worse ahead -- looking ahead, you might have to build a little bit more understandable over the next couple of years.

 

Can you just help us understand just where you are in your scenario now -- scenarios build and just today, it still looks great, tomorrow, there’s some more uncertainty.

So, how do we just get to start to understand how quickly and how you get your handle on that magnitude of ACL delta?

 

And how do you think about it versus either, I don’t know, pandemic peak or day one CECL?

It’s very hard for all of us to see this, of course.

 



Jamie Dimon

Yes.

 

As you know, I think CECL has informed us the bad accounting policy.

Honestly, I wouldn’t spend too much time on it because it’s not a real number.

 

It’s a hypothetical probability-based number.

And the way I’m trying to make it very simple for you.

 

So, if you look at the pandemic, we put up $15 billion over two quarters, and then we took it down over three or four after that.

Okay?

 

And all it did swing all these numbers, and it didn’t change that much.

I’m trying to give you a number, obviously, this number to be plus or minus several billion.

 

But if unemployment goes to 60%, [ph] and that becomes the central kind of case, and then you have possibilities it gets better and possibilities it gets worse, we would probably add something like $5 billion or $6 billion.

That probably would happen over two or three quarters.

 

I mean, that’s as simple I can make it.

Right now, what we have -- right now, we already have a percent in these adverse -- in severe adverse case.

 

We can -- if we change that next quarter, that will be part of that $6 billion I’m talking about.

The next question is coming from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

 



Ebrahim Poonawala

I guess just following up, Jamie.

 

So I appreciate CECL and the model-based approach.

I think you were quoted in the press talking about the potential for a recession in the next 6 to 9 months.

 

Would appreciate any perspective in terms of are you beginning to see cracks, either be it commercial real estate, consumer where it feels like the economic pain from inflation, higher rates is beginning to filter through to your clients?

I would appreciate any insights there.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

I’ll take that, Ebrahim.

Thanks.

 

The short answer to that question is just no.

We just don’t see anything that you could realistically describe as a crack in any of our actual credit performance.

 

I made some comments about this in the prepared remarks on the consumer side.

But we’ve done some fairly detailed analysis about different cohorts and early delinquency bucket entry rates and stuff like that.

 

And we do see, in some cases, some tiny increases.

But generally, in almost all cases, we think that’s normalization, and it’s even slower than we expect, so.

 



Jamie Dimon

Yes.

 

I think, we’re in an environment where it’s kind of odd, which is very strong consumer spend.

You see it in our numbers, you see it in other people’s numbers, up 10% prior to last year, up 35% pre-COVID.

 

Balance sheets are very good for consumers.

Credit card borrowing is normalizing, not getting worse.

 

You might see -- and that’s really good.

So, you go in a recession, you’ve got a very strong consumer.

 

However, it’s rather predictable if you look at how they’re spending and inflation.

So, inflation is 10% -- reduces that by 10%.

 

And that extra cap -- money they have in the checking accounts will deplete probably by sometime midyear next year.

And then, of course, you have inflation, higher rates, higher mortgage rates, oil -- volatility war.

 

So, those things are out there, and that is not a crack in current numbers, it’s quite predictable.

It will strain future numbers.

 



Ebrahim Poonawala

And just tied to that, I think the other thing that investors from the outside worry about is interconnectedness of the systems, be it the UK gilts market, LBOs.

 

How much are you worried about that part of the business in terms of having a meaningful impact in terms of a capital shock at some point over the next year, just given all the QT happening around the world?



Jamie Dimon

I mentioned QT as being one of the uncertainties because it’s a very large change in the flow of funds around the world, who are the buyers and sellers of sovereign debt.

 

There’s a lot of sovereign debt.

But I think if you look at -- the tilting [ph] alone is a bump, it’s not going to change what we do or how we do it.

 

And you’re going to see bumps like that because all of the things I already mentioned.

It’s inevitable that you’re going to see them.

 

Whether they create systemic risk, I don’t know.

I have pointed out, it’s harder for banks to intermediate in that, and that creates a little bit more fragility in the system.

 

That does not mean that you’re going to see a crack of some sort.

But again, it’s almost impossible not to have real volatility based on the fact where I told you.

 

Those are large uncertainties that we know about today and in the future.

The next question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities.

 



Jim Mitchell

Hey, Jeremy, at the Investor Day, you noted that expense growth in ‘23 would slow from this year’s level and might be slightly higher than consensus expectations at the time.

 

So, is that -- now that you get closer to next year, does that still hold?

And if the economy does get worse than expected, is there some levers to pull, or is it just still investing heavily regardless?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

Thanks, Jim.

So broadly, yes, it still holds.

 

No real change on the outlook.

Just to remind everyone, at Investor Day, I think the consensus was 79.5 for 2023.

 

We said you were a little low.

I think it got revised up to sort of the 80.5 or something like that.

 

And that’s still -- that’s not -- still roughly in the right ballpark.

Obviously, we’re going through our budget cycle.

 

We’re looking at the opportunity side and the environment set for next year.

So, it’s not in stone.

 

But broadly, on the question of investment, and I’m sure Jamie will agree here that our investment decisions are very much through the cycle decisions.

And so, we’re not going to tend to change those just because of a sort of difference in the short-term economic environment.

 

Of course, the volume and revenue-related expense can fluctuate as a function of the environment, as you would expect.



Jamie Dimon

Now, I would just like to add.

 

Obviously, compensations go up or down dramatically.

So, you’ll have different estimates about investment banking revenues and markets revenues, and we can’t really adjust for your numbers for that.

 

But I just want to point out the other side of this, we’re making heavy investments and we have among the best margins in the business.

I think that’s a very good thing.

 



Jim Mitchell

Right.

 

And maybe on that front, leverage loan -- were there any leverage loan write-downs this quarter?

And is that -- and how do you -- is that market beginning to clear, or are there still overhangs?

 



Jamie Dimon

There are no real levels of loan write-down this quarter, and that market isn’t yet clear.

 

We own -- our share of it is very small.

So, we’re very comfortable.

 
Operator

The next question is coming from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous.

 



John McDonald

Jeremy, I wanted to ask about your EAR disclosures, what we call your rate sensitivity disclosures.

 

They look a little different than peers.

And when we look at the sensitivity to 100 basis points of higher rates beyond the forward curve, it looks like you’re liability-sensitive.

 

Can you give us some context of maybe the limitations of that disclosure and how we should put that in context of the assumptions behind it?



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

Thanks, John.

And I’d love to have a very long conversation with you about this, but I’m going to keep it short here.

 

It’s really all about lags.

So, as our disclosure says, we do not include the impact of reprice lags in our EAR calculation.

 

So, as a result of that, the entire calculation is based on modeled rates paid in the terminal state.

As you well know, right now, we’re in the middle of some very significant lags, which are affecting the numbers quite a bit and which we expect to persist for some time.

 

So, as a result of that, what I would expect in the near term is something quite similar to what we’ve experienced this year.

As you know, this year, as rates have gone up, we’ve revised our NII outlook from 50 at the beginning of the year to now 61.5.

 

So, as we look forward in the near term from here, I would expect similar type sensitivities or rate fluctuations given the lag environment that we’re in.



John McDonald

And just to follow up on Jamie’s comments about not annualizing the fourth quarter, is that where the risks lie to annualize in the fourth quarter?

 

What are some of the puts and takes that -- you said it might be down a little bit from that fourth quarter annualized?



Jamie Dimon

Yes.

 

I’ve already mentioned, you have a rapidly changing yield curve deposit migration.

Everyone does EAR differently.

 

So, one is lag.

One is we assume deposit migration.

 

Some people don’t.

We assume -- our ECR is included there, some people don’t and all of that.

 

I just think for your models, because of all that kind of stuff, just use a number less than annualized in the 19.

So, instead of 76, use a number like 74.

 

Just keep it as simple as possible, and we don’t know.

We hope to beat that, but with all the stuff going on, I just -- you just got to be a little cautious and conservative.

 
Operator

The next question is coming from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS.

 



Erika Najarian

I agree with Ebrahim that your presentation this morning was quite crisp and impactful.

 

So, I’m going to ask the question that I think has been sort of the key debate to the stock all year.

So, at Investor Day in May, you mentioned a ROTCE target of 17%, and that was before we found out that the SCB would be higher in June.

 

As we think about -- your capital build is going faster than expected and you think about the revenue power that shows through in this firm, plus or minus what may happen with CECL, do you think you can achieve 17% ROTCE next year?



Jamie Dimon

Yes.

 

That’s obviously a good question.

The answer is yes.

 

And one of the things we always look at is normalized ROTCE.

So, we’re very honest.

 

We are -- we’re not over earning in NII, maybe a little bit because the lags and stuff like that, but not a lot, but we are over earning on credit.

Think of credit card.

 

And the 1.5%, we’ve never seen a number of that low risk.

We’re quite conscious of that.

 

So we don’t drag about the 19% this quarter, figure that’s going to continue but it was not.

And obviously, we may adjust that 17 a little bit, but it’s not a material adjustment.

 

We’re going to -- we’ve got a lot of great, bright people.

We’re going to find a lot of ways to squeeze some of these things down, including like call CCAR is and SCB and liquidate some assets and change business models just a little bit.

 

If you look at our acquisition, for example, they were a non-G-SIFI acquisitions, noncapital, non-G-SIFI, all services and service related.

So, that’s what we’re going to do over time, and we’re pretty comfortable that we’ll get very good returns.

 

So yes, we’re quite -- and next year is totally dependent on what happens in [Technical Difficulty].

But the other thing I would look at, maybe both given this number of other time, is what would we earn in a recession?

 

We would have pretty damn good returns in a recession.

I mean -- so I feel very good about that.

 



Erika Najarian

And this is a super micro question as a follow-up for Jeremy.

 

Why would Markets NII be zero next quarter?

And should we expect that to be zero next year?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

Thanks, Erika.



Jamie Dimon

We’re advancing the Markets businesses at the yield curve.

 

So, you’re earning this and you’re paying to finance the training book.



Jeremy Barnum

Yes, Erika.

 

I mean, basically, as rates go up, the funding cost goes up.

And the offsets on the other side, in many cases, work through derivatives or derivatives like instruments, so it goes through NIR.

 

Fundamentally, we believe the Markets business revenue is rate insensitive.

You can see that history through our disclosures this year.

 

So, as you look out to next year with the forward curve implying a much less biased evolution of Fed funds, you shouldn’t expect to see as many changes at least from rates.

Of course, we can sometimes see somewhat more unpredictable changes from balances, but that should be unbiased, one way or the other.

 
Operator

The next question is coming from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo.

 



Mike Mayo

Jamie, once again, I’m trying to reconcile your actions with your words.

 

You’ve said publicly, you mentioned the hurricane.

You mentioned a recession.

 

You mentioned look out, and there are all sorts of risks.

I don’t think anyone disagrees with that.

 

On the other hand, your reserves to loans are still well below CECL day one.

So, your actions with the reserving don’t seem to reflect your more pessimistic comments about the economy.

 

So, how do I reconcile the two?



Jamie Dimon

Yes.

 

So, the way to do that is in our CECL -- in our reserves today, there is a significant percentage probability that we put on adverse and severe adverse already.

So, it’s in there already.

 

A lot of people work in the CECL reserves.

Our economists, Jeremy, a lot of other folks.

 

It’s not set by me because I have to think that the odds might be different than other people.

And so -- but I conclude as Jeremy saying.

 

But the numbers are very good.

We have some of that.

 

I’m trying to be very honest about if things get worse, here’s what it might will mean for reserves.

That may be different because, of course, these calculations change a lot of time.

 

But that will be, Michael, which is another thing, which is CECL, the timing of when something happens is very important.

So, if it happens, if you said a recession is going to happen in the fourth quarter of next year, that would be very different -- so, it’s going to happen in the first quarter of next year.

 



Mike Mayo

Yes, I just understood it as the lifetime losses on the loans as opposed to that...

 



Jamie Dimon

It is.

 

But some loans -- yes, some loans have a short life and some loans have a long life.



Mike Mayo

Let’s just cut to the chase.

 

So, where are you versus three months ago?

I mean, is it -- you certainly got headlines with the hurricane comment and all that.

 

And it’s -- look, like as you said, you have Fed tightening, QT, tighter capital rules for banks.

You have like the trifecta of tightening by the Fed and then you have wars and everything else.

 

So I don’t think -- and the stock market supports your view and about all the risks out there, but are things better, worse or the same as they were three months ago?



Jamie Dimon

They’re roughly the same.

 

We’re just getting closer to what you and I might consider bad events.

So -- in my hurricane, I’ve been very consistent, but looking at probabilities and possibilities.

 

There is still, for example, a possibility of a soft land.

We can debate what we think that percentage of yours might be different than mine, but there’s a possibility of a mild recession.

 

Consumers are in very good shape, companies are in a very good shape.

And there’s possibility is something worse, mostly because of the war in Ukraine and oil price and all things like that.

 

Those -- I would not change by possibilities and probabilities this quarter versus last quarter, for me.

And that’s relatively different point.

 



Mike Mayo

Yes.

 

Last follow-up.

I know your investor cycles.

 

You’ve always done that.

You’re consistent.

 

But I mean, your headcount increase is probably going to be the highest in the industry.

I mean, headcount from 266,000 to 288,000, your CIB, you’re adding headcount.

 

I mean, you did expect weakness in nine months from now, wouldn’t you wait to hire people, maybe get them a little cheaper?



Jamie Dimon

No.

 
Operator

The next question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.

 



Betsy Graseck

A couple of questions.

 

One, just on the investment spend, could you give us a sense as to the areas that you’re leaning in the most, as we should be thinking about into next year?

Because you’ve obviously done a lot this year with regard to technology advancement, companies that you’re buying to enhance your digital capabilities and international expansion, in particular on the consumer side.

 

So, just thinking through is this continuation on those themes, or is there something else we should be looking for?



Jamie Dimon

Betsy, it’s exactly what we showed you at Investor Day, almost no change.

 

So, take out that deck, we broke out by business kind of investment.

Investment spend in tech is pretty much on track for that.

 



Betsy Graseck

And the inflation that drives some of that cost structure, you can deal with through just efficiencies elsewhere.

 

Is that fair?



Jamie Dimon

Believe it or not, that was in the numbers we gave you in May.

 



Betsy Graseck

Okay.

 

And then separately on the bond restructuring that you did this quarter and the comments around, look, we don’t need to hold stuff we don’t need to hold, we don’t want to hold with that.

That kind of suggests to me that there’ll be more bond restructuring as we go through the next quarter.

 

Is there a reason why you didn’t clean the whole thing up this quarter?



Jamie Dimon

No, I think I said we sell rich securities and buy cheap.

 

So, if you look at -- if you looked what happened to mortgage spreads, they gapped out.

They gapped in, we bought.

 

They gapped out, we sold and that kind of stuff, you’re getting 2, getting 2.5s.

So you can have different point of views.

 

But, I do expect future bond losses going forward.

I just don’t think that’s real earnings.

 

So, I think -- but I want our people, our experts in the investment areas to know, if they really want to sell something, we’re going to sell it.

We’re not going to sit here and lock ourselves into somebody who’s gotten very, very rich because we feel like we can’t take a bond loss.

 

And remember, it doesn’t affect capital.

And in fact, when you reinvest it, which we tend to do, we actually have higher earnings going forward.

 
Operator

The next question is coming from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.

 



Jamie Dimon

And let me just add too, like you saw the CLOs gapped out in Europe.

 

I want our people, when they gapped out -- like 300 or 400 basis points, I want them to be willing to buy.

They might sell something to do that, but that is a very smart thing to do.

 



Glenn Schorr

Okay.

 

Thank you.

So, it’s Glenn.

 

So look, from time to time, where things happen in the market, we get these losses like Arcagos and now this UK pension LDI issue.

So, my question for you is, besides that, do you have risk in the derivatives book?

 

And is the situation done?

It’s more of when you meet with Risk Committee, are there pockets of leverage that you’re considering on these big market moves, whether it be the dollar or rates where we are not thinking of like us, or do you view the LDI issue as an isolated event?

 



Jamie Dimon

I’ll mention, and Jeremy, you might have something to add.

 

So, the LDI thing is a bump in the road.

And I think the Bank of England is also trying to get through this thing without changing the policy about monetary policy and QT.

 

And I was surprised to see how much leverage there was in some of those pension plans.

And my experience in life has been you have things like what we’re going through today, there are going to be other surprises.

 

Someone is going to be off sides.

We don’t see anything looks systemic, but there is leverage in certain credit portfolio, there’s leverage for certain companies -- there is leverage.

 

So you’re probably going to see some of that.

I do think you see volatile markets.

 

You already see very low liquidity.

So, something like the LDI think could cause more issues down the road, if it happens constantly and stuff like that.

 

But so far, it’s a bump in the road.

The banking system itself is extraordinarily strong.

 



Glenn Schorr

Would the dollar qualify as one of those super strong moves that could put people offsides?

 

And if so, how do you make sure you protect JPMorgan against that?



Jamie Dimon

Well, we’re -- because we’re -- we generally -- we do not -- we’re not taking them.

 

We generally hedge when it comes to big currencies and stuff like that.

But yes, dollar flows, QT, emerging markets hedge funds, yes, that would be a category that might -- something might happen there.

 

It wouldn’t be -- it shouldn’t be something that’s going to affect JPMorgan that much.

In fact, it usually creates an opportunity for JPMorgan.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yes, I’m not going to [Technical Difficulty] what was traditionally the case that emerging markets struggle, sovereign struggle with the kind of dollar strength that we’re experiencing right now, but our emerging market franchise folks have been through these cycles before.

 

So, we manage through it.



Glenn Schorr

Thank you, both.

 

I appreciate it.



Jamie Dimon

Just to add to the strength of the franchise, I remember looking back at our emerging markets results by quarter over a decade, it was shocking to me how few quarters and how few countries we ever lost money.

 

We may have had low returns in some quarters, but it was shocking.

We made money in Argentina every -- almost every year for the last 20 years.

 

And I think there was one quarter we put up reserves for one of the oil companies and took them down, but it’s kind of very -- the stability is striking.
Operator

The next question is coming from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets.

 



Gerard Cassidy

You guys have been talking about the system liquidity with, Jamie, you referenced QT, also the fragility of the system.

 

Can you share with us what are the metrics you guys are looking at to see if the system does have a problem on liquidity?

Just this week, you probably saw that the Swiss National Bank upped its reserve, currency swapped lines to $6.3 billion.

 

So, what are some of the things you guys focus in on to see if there’s going to be maybe more -- some liquidity issues that could lead to greater problems?



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

I mean, Gerard, broadly, if you just look at standard regulatory reporting of LCR ratios in the U.S.

banking system, everyone just has very significant surpluses.

 

And of course, we can go into the question of as QT plays through and how that interacts with RPM loan growth, whether that puts some pressure on banking system deposits, but that’s starting from a very, very strong position.

So, there’s a lot of cushion there for that to come down before you start to have a real challenge from a liquidity perspective.

 



Jamie Dimon

Yes.

 

We look at everything from the Fed repo, deposit tightening to net issuance of treasury, net issuance of mortgages and treasury volatility and treasury bid-ask spreads and treasury markets and all that.

We’re looking at all of that.

 

The banking itself is extremely strong, extremely strong.

It’s not -- what you’re going to see will not be in the banking.

 

And there may be bankers outside somewhere, but it will be somewhere else.

It will be somewhere else.

 

It might be in credit, it might be in emerging margins.

It might be in FX, but you’re likely to have something like that, you have events like the ones we’re talking about.

 



Gerard Cassidy

Very good.

 

And then, in terms of the investment banking and capital markets businesses, can you guys give us any color into pipelines, how they stood at the end of the third quarter?

And as you’re going into the fourth quarter, what you’re seeing in terms of those business lines?

 



Jamie Dimon

Yes.

 

And I’ve always pointed out to you all, the pipelines come and go, okay?

You’ve seen that the size, there never had before.

 

So pipeline is not necessarily to see.

I would put in your model lower IB revenues next quarter than this quarter based on what we see today.

 

Markets, we have no idea.

Seasonally, it’s generally a low quarter, the fourth quarter, but we don’t know this quarter because there’s so much activity taking place, and your guess is as good as ours.

 
Operator

The next question is coming from the line of Matt O’Connor from Deutsche Bank.

 



Matt O’Connor

Can you guys talk about the outlook for loan growth the next few quarters?

 

And besides some of the obvious areas like leverage lending and correspondent mortgage you already talked about, any areas that you’re tightening around the edges?



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

Matt, let me take your last question first.

So, in general, no, we underwrite through the cycle.

 

We haven’t -- we didn’t really loosen our underwriting standards in the moment where everything looked great.

And so, we don’t see any need to tighten now, really a lot of consistency there.

 

In terms of the actual loan growth outlook, we have said for this year, obviously, only one quarter left, that we’d have high single digits.

No meaningful change in that outlook there, probably a little bit of a headwind as a function of rates, as you mentioned, and some of the RWA optimization in mortgages.

 

As we go into next year, we remain very positive and optimistic about the card story across a range of dimensions, in terms of both, outstandings and revolve normalization.

But for the rest of the loan growth environment, it’s going to be, I think, very dependent, especially in wholesale on the macro situation.

 

We know that in recession environments, we tend to see lower loan demand.

At the same time, we’ve got a lot of great initiatives going and client engagement and new clients.

 

So, we’ll just have to see how that plays out next year.



Matt O’Connor

And I guess, when we read headlines about home prices going down in some markets and car prices starting to roll, I mean, why doesn’t that drive some tightening in those businesses?

 



Jamie Dimon

Well, it has.

 

I mean look at the volumes and mortgage have dropped and cars, the quota have dropped and stuff like that.

And that’s already in our numbers, and we would expect that to continue that way.

 
Operator

The last question is coming from the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners.

 



Charles Peabody

Yes.

 

I’m just curious in your guidance on NII where you kind of implied fourth quarter would be peak run rate.

Next year, do you factor in any impact from a possible treasury buyback program, which could redirect liquidity out of the money market system into the banking system, and therefore, keep your deposit betas lower?

 

Do you think about that at all as a possibility?



Jamie Dimon

Yes.

 

I think I -- I don’t know if you were listening when I said it before.

QT, net issuance in mortgages, net issuance in treasuries globally is going to reduce deposits and create certain forms of volatility and absolutely incorporated that our thinking, including lags, the change in the yield curve, change in spreads and all those things in the numbers we gave you.

 

And that’s why we’re being -- trying to be conservative in NII, that while you can annualize the 19 to 76, it’s going have a model, put in 74 and it incorporates all of that.

Jack Dorsey

Thank you all for joining us.

 

As we've discussed before, we're building multiple ecosystems to serve different audiences.

Square for sellers, Cash App for consumers, Tidal for musicians and TBD for developers.

 

What makes Block unique is our ability to connect all of these together.

We've made a lot of progress on each and I'll share some highlights from Square and Cash App before Amrita’s remarks and your questions.

 

We'll start with Square; we realize there are some significant challenges all businesses are facing today.

And so giving sellers simple and intuitive tools to remove complexity from running their business is critical.

 

We're focused on three priorities to achieve this.

Enabling omni channel capabilities.

 

Growing up market and expanding internationally.

Core to our strategy is building integrated solutions to give larger sellers a cohesive view of their operations so that they can easily manage every aspect of running a business.

 

Our developer platform extends our software capabilities by allowing integrations with hundreds of third-party products built by developers and partners using our open platform.

We enable customized solutions for sellers with more complex needs, and provide a single platform for developers to take payments from Square across mobile in person and web.

 

We're also continuing to build out vertical point of sale solutions that serve our largest verticals in food and drink, retail and services with Square for Restaurants, Square for Retail and Square appointments.

Together gross profit from these solutions grows 45% year-over-year, much faster than Square overall in the quarter.

 

In Q3, we also expanded the payment methods we support.

In US, we launched Apple’s Tap to Pay on iPhone, giving Square sellers a simple way to accept contactless payments with no hardware needed, and customers a convenient way to pay.

 

In Japan, sellers can now accept pay PayPay QR code payments, the most popular QR code wallet in the country.

And now for Cash App.

 

As we shared during our Investor Day earlier this year, we're focused on building seven development pillars to drive Cash App’s business.

I'll touch on progress we made these quarter and financial services and commerce.

 

Within financial services, we want to strengthen our relationships with customers through a full suite of banking products.

It starts with customers being able to easily fund their cash up accounts.

 

Over time, we've expanded the ways customers can do this, whether through direct deposit, paper money, cheque deposits, or bank transfers.

Cash App Card and direct deposit are two of our most important banking products.

 

And we're focused on growing usage of both.

Cash App Card is usually our first financial services product that customers try, and often their introduction to banking with Cash App.

 

As of September, there were nearly 18 million actives using Cash App Card, making up more than 35% of our monthly actives, and bringing in half of all inflows across our platform.

In Q3, we made it easier to bank with us, customers can now receive an account and routing number instantly when ordering a Cash App Card.

 

This reduces friction for those who need banking services and has driven meaningful growth in direct deposit customers.

As we continue to deepen the connections between our ecosystems and undertake the complex integration of Afterpay, one of the long-term opportunities we are most excited for is in commerce.

 

In Q3, we completed the rollout of our first iteration of the new Discover tab.

Make it seamless for customers to search for people and businesses and find offers including instant discounts for merchants who accept Cash App Pay.

 

Cash App Pay lets customers checkout through a simple QR code payment, whether online or in person.

After testing Cash App Pay on Square sellers over the past year, we're beginning to broaden Cash App Pay acceptance outside of the Square ecosystem Starting with select Afterpay merchants.

 

We're still early in our journey to transform Cash App into a commerce destination that bridges our seller and consumer ecosystems.

We believe it'll take some time to achieve this vision.

 

And doing so will bring us back to our original mission to help sellers make more sales.

Finally, we know a lot changed in our business over the last year, including with the acquisition of Afterpay.

 

And we recognize that understanding our business today may seem complex, especially in a changing macro environment.

We're working to distill how we invest and operate into a clearer and more cohesive framework to help you better understand our business in 2023 and the longer term.

 

Amrita will be addressing some of our current thinking for 2023 today in her remarks, but we plan to do so more comprehensively in our fourth quarter call in February.

And with that, here is Amrita.

 



Amrita Ahuja 

Thanks Jack.

 

There are three topics I'd like to cover today.

First, an overview of our third quarter results.

 

Second, trends we've seen across our business in October and third our discipline around expenses.

In the third quarter, we delivered strong growth across our ecosystems with gross profit of $1.57 billion, up 38% year-over-year and 46% on a three-year CAGR basis.

 

Gross profit includes a $19 million impact in the amortization of acquired technology assets primarily related to Afterpay.

And excluding these non-cash expenses gross profit was $1.59 billion.

 

We delivered strong profitability during the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $327 million.

In the third quarter, our BNPL platform, which we acquired through the acquisition of Afterpay, contributed $150 million of gross profit split across Square and Cash App, and excluding this gross profit for the quarter was $1.42 billion, up 25% on a year-over-year basis, and 42% on a three-year CAGR basis.

 

Cash App generated $774 million of gross profit in the third quarter, an increase of 51% year-over-year and 84% on a three-year CAGR basis, excluding our BNPL platform Cash App gross profit was $700 million, up 37% year-over-year and 78% on a three-year CAGR basis.

This quarter overall inflows into Cash App totaled $52 billion for growth of 19% year-over-year and represented our highest quarterly inflows into Cash App.

 

Let's look into the drivers using our inflows framework across active, inflows per active and monetization rate.

First, our network reached 49 million transacting actives in September, up 20% on a year-over-year basis, with daily and weekly actives growing even faster.

 

With Cash App community pillar, we remain focused on enhancing the viral growth of peer to peer with complementary marketing programs that target new audiences.

Second inflows per active average $1,046 in the third quarter, which was relatively consistent with the first and second quarters and was also stable on a year-over-year basis.

 

Inflows per Active has been driven by continued product adoption with Cash App Card and direct deposit as Jack mentioned, and by expanding our inflow channels.

We believe driving inflows per active starts with customers’ ability to easily fund their Cash App accounts through a variety of channels.

 

Together direct deposit and paper money deposits have made up a growing share of overall inflows reaching 14% of inflows in the third quarter, up from 9% a year ago.

In September, customers received more than $2 billion in direct deposits into their Cash App accounts.

 

Driven by strong growth in direct deposit, active and direct deposit inflows per active compared to the prior year.

Paper money deposits cross nearly $3.5 billion in cumulative deposits through September, only a year since launch.

 

Square generated $783 million of gross profit in the third quarter, an increase of 29% both year-over-year and on a three-year CAGR basis.

Excluding $75 million of gross profits from our BNPL platform, Square gross profit was $708 million, up 17% year-over-year and 25% on a three-year CAGR basis.

 

Square GPV grew 20% year-over-year in the quarter or 22% on a constant currency basis, with a two-point headwind to growth from foreign exchange rates.

Looking at our cohort economics, we continue to see healthy retention trends across our existing seller base.

 

In the third quarter, we achieved positive GPV and gross profit retention for our Square business.

Looking into the drivers at Square’s third quarter performance.

 

First, we continue to drive growth with larger sellers, gross profit for mid-market sellers is up 22% year-over-year and 39% on a three-year CAGR basis.

Our developer tools have helped us serve the needs of larger, more complex sellers, allowing us to grow up markets.

 

During the third quarter, nearly 50% of midmarket GPV was generated by sellers connected to our open developer platform.

Second, we've continued to expand globally and the third quarter GPV from our markets outside the US grew 40% year-over-year, or 55% on a constant currency basis as foreign exchange witnessed significant drag on a year-over-year growth across all international markets.

 

Looking at volume trends by market in the quarter, growth in Australia and Canada remains strong while we saw a macro related slowdown in the UK.

Now to provide an update on our BNPL platform, which we acquired through the Afterpay acquisition.

 

In the third quarter GMV for our BNPL platform was $5.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year, or 60% on a three-year CAGR basis.

For overall growth trends, we've experienced an impact from spend shifts from online to in person, competitive dynamics as well as foreign currency, which slowed year-over-year GMV growth by five points in the third quarter.

 

As we integrate Afterpay, our teams are focused on bridging commerce across Cash App and Square and are making steady progress towards their longer-term vision.

On a GAAP basis, revenue for our BNPL platform was up 6% year-over-year growing slower than GMV given mix shifts to enterprise sellers and newer markets.

 

Gross profit was down 3% year-over-year impacted by $12 million in amortization of intangibles within cost of sales.

Without this impact, gross profit would have been more in line with revenue growth.

 

Losses on consumer receivables were 0.96% of GMV during the third quarter, an improvement quarter-over-quarter, compared to 1.02% in the second quarter, and an improvement year-over-year.

Driven by mix shift as well as enhancements to our risk models and processes during the first half of the year.

 

We continue to see healthy consumer repayment behavior with more than 95% of installments paid on time.

As we enter into 2023, we intend on simplifying many of these disclosures.

 

We don't intend on speaking to our BNPL performance separately once we anniversary the acquisition of Afterpay.

And we'll also shift our focus away from three-year CAGR and towards year-over-year growth rates as we lap the onset of the pandemic three years ago.

 

Next, an update on recent trends on both a year-over-year and three-year CAGR basis, October total gross profit growth is expected -- is estimated to be relatively consistent with the third quarter.

In October, we estimate overall company gross profit growth of 37% on a year-over-year basis, including our BNPL platform, or 24% excluding our BNPL platform.

 

We expect fourth quarter gross profit growth to remain relatively consistent with third quarter growth rates on both a year-over-year and three-year CAGR basis at the total company level.

Now let's dig into some of the dynamics by ecosystem.

 

For Cash App, we expect the year-over-year gross profit growth rate to improve in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.

We saw this play out in October where we estimate Cash App gross profit growth excluding our BNPL platform improved on a year-over-year basis compared to 37% in the third quarter.

 

On a three-year CAGR basis, we expect to see a slight decrease in Cash App’s gross profit growth in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter as we lap the launch of tabs in 2019.

Cash App’s gross profit growth in October was driven by growth in active and monetization rates, while inflows per active was relatively consistent on a year-over-year basis.

 

Cash App Card continue to have strong momentum on active and spend per active, which both increased on a year-over-year basis.

For Square, we expect the year-over-year growth rate for gross profit excluding our BNPL platform to moderate in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.

 

Given we are now lapping $59 million of non-recurring PPP gross profit recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Excluding PPP and our BNPL platform, we expect year-over-year gross profit growth per Square in the fourth quarter to be relatively consistent with the third quarter, which had a 19% year-over-year growth rate with the same exclusions.

 

On a three-year CAGR basis, we expect gross profit growth, excluding our BNPL platform to decrease slightly in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter.

Looking at recent volume trends, we estimate square GPV in October was up 16% year-over-year compared to 20% growth in the third quarter, and on a constant currency basis 19% year-over-year as compared to 22% in the third quarter.

 

Trends on a three-year CAGR basis were more stable as we estimate GPV grew by 21% in October compared to 22% in the third quarter.

By region, growth in the US remained relatively stable through October.

 

However, we've seen a meaningful slowdown in year-over-year GPV growth in our international markets primarily driven by foreign exchange rates, and to a lesser extent the ongoing macro related slowdown in the UK.

In October, we estimate that international GPV was up 23% year-over-year or 44% on a constant currency basis.

 

Moving to our planned investments for the fourth quarter of 2022.

While our business trends have remained stable through October, we have been increasingly focused on our spend amidst an uncertain macro environment.

 

We plan to reduce our investments for the full year 2022 by an additional $140 million, which brings the total pullback on our planned non-GAAP operating expenses on the year to $519 million, or approximately 25% of our expected step up entering the year.

For the first quarter, we expect to increase non-GAAP operating expenses by $206 million compared to the third quarter.

 

Looking ahead to 2023, we are still in the process of finalizing our plans for next year.

And while we aren't quite ready to share specifics, we wanted to give you a sense of how we're thinking about next year.

 

Over the past several years, we've significantly grown our business and our expense base.

Looking to 2023, we're focused on operating more efficiently, and we expect to slow our pace of expense growth meaningfully compared to prior years.

 

Based on our preliminary plans, our outlook includes a slowdown across several areas of our discretionary expenses, a continuation of the discipline you've seen from us in recent quarters, in particular two areas to underscore.

First, hiring.

 

Headcount makes up the largest driving -- driver of our expense base.

In 2023, we expect to significantly moderate our pace of hiring compared to recent years, which will benefit our financial results on a lag with greater leverage on headcount costs expected in the back half of 2023 and into 2024.

 

Second, sales and marketing.

In 2023, we intend on pulling back on lower ROI, more experimental areas, including brand and awareness spend across both our Square and Cash App ecosystems, and continue investing in channels with more proven ROI.

 

Outside of these 1/3 of our non-GAAP operating expenses include variable expenses, which have historically grown more in line with overall gross profit, including transaction and loan losses, peer to peer costs, Cash App Card issuance costs and expenses related to data and our platform infrastructure.

We continue to see a compelling opportunity for long-term growth and we're prepared to be dynamic with our spend as we see the macro environment play out, both investing more when we see returns and pulling back with lower or uncertain returns as we've done in the past.

 

We'd love to share more on our approach for the coming year in our fourth quarter earnings call in February.

Ultimately, we remain focused on balancing growth and profitability in this environment.

 

We want to operate with efficiency and agility in 2023 and beyond with an increasing focus on not only top line growth, but also profitability across both adjusted EBITDA and profit metrics that factor in stock-based compensation, where we intend on driving leverage over time.

To conclude, as we enter an uncertain macro environment, our agility means we can track our business trends in real time across a diverse set of products and customers.

 

And make strategic decisions quickly to support our customers and adapt to the changes we observed.

With that, we'll open it up to your questions.

 
Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.

 



Tien Huang

Thank you, nice to see the strong revenue, gross profit and EBITDA here.

 

So just want to build on what you just talked about there.

I'm really just thinking ahead.

 

I know you're not going to give too much specific guidance for fiscal ‘23.

But is it reasonable to expect that Block is now in a position to show some operating leverage in ‘23, given the less certain macro, and you've invested quite a bit, it looks like you're getting good returns since the bottom of the pandemic here, but can we get back to operating leverage when we get back to ‘23?

 

Thank you.



Amrita Ahuja 

Thanks for the question, Tien-Tsin.

 

We are focused on driving long term profitable growth at scale.

And what that means for us is that we're going to balance growth and margins in our investment framework.

 

As you note, given the significant growth of our business, we've grown our investments over the past few years to create products and marketing engines that help us drive that top line growth paired with profitable unit economics across both of our ecosystems.

Our preliminary 2023 plans really significantly moderate those expense -- that expense growth as we focus on balancing growth and profitability.

 

Longer term we do -- we will continue to moderate that expense growth to drive increased operating efficiency, profitability.

And specifically for Cash App, we do expect to see operating leverage next year.

 

We'll have more to say in February, of course, as we're still in our planning stages across the business.

Our focus ultimately is on agility.

 

As the environment continues to evolve here, we want to remain agile and be able to adapt to what we're seeing.

And we intend on maintaining the discipline that you've seen so far this year with a pullback in discretionary operating expenses, particularly in those areas that are less efficient, or conversely leaned into areas where we are seeing attractive returns and that enable us to grow our business in a profitable way over time.

 

We've proven that ability to kind of dial back expenses in real time so far this year, we pulled back almost $600 million, about 10% of our planned OpEx space, or 25% of the step up, where we haven't seen returns or where the returns are less certain in order to deliver more near-term profitability.

That gives us the confidence in our ability to continue to invest in and help us determine how much is needed to drive that next incremental dollar of growth and where we should be prioritizing our investment over time.

Your next question is from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.

 



Lisa Ellis

Terrific.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

I just wanted to follow up that call out in your shareholder letter and the prepared remarks about the 18 million monthly Cash App Card users, you now have 35% of total monthly active.

 

Can you elaborate a bit on the nature of the cash card users?

So for example, do you have a sense for how many cash card users you now have using the cash card as their primary debit card?

 

Or like are these banks consumers?

Or is this their primary bank accounts?

 

And what steps are you taking to kind of keep building out the wallet share of those cash card users?

I think you had highlighted at Investor Day they drive something like five times as much gross profit as non-cash card user.

 

Thank you.



Amrita Ahuja 

Hey, Lisa.

 

Thanks for the question.

I can kick off here.

 

Driving product adoption for us across our banking products is one of our primary focus areas within our Cash App pillar around financial services.

And we've experienced strong attach rates here.

 

These financial services products allow us to really deepen our relationship with our customers beyond just peer to peer and serve them more holistically related to their finances.

So specifically for Cash App Card as 18 million monthly actives in September growing 20%, sorry growing strongly and now growing in terms of attach at 35% of our monthly active during the month.

 

And also with strong engagement in September Cash App Card actives made 16 purchases during the month on average.

So we're seeing our customers using their card on average every other day, and really with broad based utility with customers spending across a diverse range of use cases, gas and utilities, restaurants and grocery, various retailers.

 

And with spend that's increased over time on a per user basis.

So in the third quarter spend per active grew on a year-over-year basis, bringing where as we see our customers bringing more of their spend to Cash App Card.

 

And as Jack noted, Cash App Card customers accounted for about half of overall inflows into Cash App, to your point about the importance of this customer base to our ecosystem.

And these customers have also significantly higher monetization rates compounding together as they bring more inflows at a higher monetization rate, to drive even greater gross profit from this Cash App Card customer cohort.

 

Maybe the final thing that I'd say here is that Cash App Card is an important way for us to bring Cash App to greater top of mind from a financial services perspective, certainly top of wallet for our customers, bigger part of a core offering as we graduate our customers from peer to peer into the ease of use of our financial services products.

And we see that really resonating with younger demographics, but also as a way to drive greater adoption into other banking products like direct deposit, where we've now eliminated the friction of allowing customers to create a direct deposit account the moment, they sign up for Cash App Card and which has, though it's still early days, is meaningfully increase the adoption of direct deposit as well for us.

 

So it's important in and of itself, but also important as the gateway to adopting other baking products within Cash App.



Jack Dorsey

I'll just say to your question, we don't have the data on whether we're primarily against other cards or other banks.

 

But that is certainly our goal.

And I think we have a better strategy over the over the long term.

 

In that we're not just a card, we're not just savings, our other features that we offer, including the Discover tab to find commerce, Bitcoin, stocks, deposits, people and peer to peer, obviously, which is the easiest way to send money to anyone.

People come in for various different reasons, and they will find our other services.

 

And ideally, those services resonate even more.

And our goal, at first is to be first consideration for any one of these services, including the Cash App Card.

 

But over time, we want to work towards being primary because everything that you need in your financial life, you can find within Cash App.

So that is the goal, that's what we're focused on.

 

And I think we have the best strategy to get there.
Operator

We have Ali Kenis, square seller dialing in to ask a question.

 



Unidentified Analyst

Hi, Jack, thanks so much for taking my question.

 

My name is Ali and I own Sugar Lab Bake Shop in Ventura, California.

We've been using Square to run operations at Sugar Lab for the last 10 years, which is as long as we've been in business.

 

We have grown to over 45 employees over the years not currently.

But we do use several Square software and hardware products, including stand, point of sale, marketing, loyalty, savings, payroll, and more.

 

Pretty much everything.

And then I'm also a Square super seller.

 

So my question is, as the tight labor market continues in the food industry, we have fewer bakers and kitchen staff this year, how can Square help us prepare to handle the seasonal rush, and what are ways in which I can attract talent in time for the holidays, especially given that we're competing with larger businesses.



Jack Dorsey

Thank you, and congrats on your business.

 

I think that I think the biggest thing here is anything that we can do from a technology perspective, to give you time back first and foremost, to make sure that you're not wasting a bunch of time looking up different systems and fiddling with interface that all the solutions we provide are intuitive, and they get easier and easier and potentially even more automated.

So that you can focus more on what you have and doing a whole lot more with less.

 

So that is the first part and we're focused a lot on that internally.

But there are also products that will take some of the workload off you such as self-serve ordering and Square payrolls on demand pay, and also making it much more efficient for your employees.

 

So our team management product, I don't know if you've used that yet.

We've -- we focus a lot of energy on making sure that the team and the employees and your 45 [Indiscernible] where it could be quite useful that they have all the information they need to help you operate and run the business very efficiently.

 

All of these things that we're doing today, we're going to continue to improve with more automation, more artificial intelligence that you can turn on and off and really make informed decisions around how you run your business.

And as you continue to grow your business becomes more and more attractive to more people.

 

So by focusing on your customers, and making sure that you have your time focus entirely on that instead of all the operational capacities or needs of your business, which is where we come in, your business gets more successful, more people want to join.

So thank you for using Square and we’ll keep at it.

Your next question comes from line up Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.

 



Darrin Peller

Hey, guys, thanks.

 

Look, just following up a little more on Cash App, the combination of monthly active users shrank continues as well as the gross profit, looks like attach rates to card was a key part.

But if you could just remind us on what you see is the real opportunity there in terms of attach rates on different products and what really what the path is for ARPU when layering in not only what you've already done them in sort of the financial services side, but also what kind of opportunity pay with cash can be and how the progress is going there, too.

 

Thanks, guys.



Amrita Ahuja 

Hey, Darrin, thanks for the question.

 

So let me start with kind of where we are in terms of ARPU, which is another metric you can measure along with the overall influence frameworks, and then talk about where some of our product priorities to, based on where we're driving key elements of the inflows framework forward.

So from an ARPU perspective gross profit per active, excluding the BNPL platform was $57, in the third quarter, up from $53, in the second and $50 in the first quarter.

 

So we are continuing to see growth there, in part driven by our monetization rate, in part driven by the increased utilization of the platform strong engagement on the Cash App platform.

If you break that down across our inflows framework, what we look at is actives, where we've continued to see strong growth inflows per active, which we've seen continued stability, despite now lapping some of the significant government disbursements and even some of the seasonal tax benefits from the first half of this year.

 

And then monetization rate where as I said we have some products where we can flex our pricing.

In some products, where we are driving engagement and driving utilization.

 

That inflows framework is really clarifying for us in terms of our product roadmap, and where we see the traction across each of those variables.

And so there's three top product development pillars that I'd call out our financial services, network growth and trust in terms of being able to continue to drive the Cash App platform forward.

 

From a financial services perspective, as you've noted, we've seen growing adoption here, and that's a key -- top priority for us in 2023, to see continued adoption of these products, across not only Cash App Card and direct deposit, where there's a lot more for us to do there, strong traction, but continued runway ahead, but also through some of the newer products that are continuing to take hold like Cash App Pay, as you noted, where we see 60% of Cash App Pay volumes are now from customers who aren't active in Cash App Card, showing that strong brand affinity for our products, beyond even a strong attached product, like Cash App Card.

And also for products like Cash App Card Borrow which we're still in the early days of ramping and where we've seen strong growth with profitable unit economics.

 

From a network growth perspective, our priorities here is using our core differentiator, which is the network effects inherent in Cash App to really bring customer engagement out and enable our customers to engage more with their network and with each other, including bringing others from their network into Cash App.

And then from a trust perspective we've evolved relatively quickly from a peer-to-peer app into a financial services app.

 

And trust in our platform is extremely important, as customers bring more of their money into the app.

And so that's another key focus for us as we drive our inflows framework forward and ultimately, as we drive ARPU forward as well.

Your next question is from line of Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse.

 



Timothy Chiodo

Great, thank you for taking the question.

 

I want to talk a little bit about Cash App customer acquisition costs.

So it's taking us back actually to a comment that you made last quarter.

 

You mentioned that CAC was relatively stable versus 2021, which was at the time you had mentioned the $10 blended CAC number so we were a little bit surprised to hear that that simply because you've been moving more towards building density with higher income customers and making the direct deposit push, and we would have expected that to maybe come up a little bit, if you could just talk about what some of the offsets have been, how you've been able to contain those customer acquisition costs, clearly the peer to peer network is a part of it, but maybe some of the other drivers boost Afterpay.

And then broadly to the extent you can, if you could give us an update on gross adds and churn trends for the Cash App base overall.

 



Amrita Ahuja 

Hey, Tim, I can kick us off here.

 

Thanks for the question.

We've continued to see relative efficiency in terms of our sales and marketing spend here, with a cost of acquisition for net new actives in line, continue to be in line with what we saw in 2020, and ’21 as you note in that $10, sort of customer acquisition cost range.

 

We are looking to drive new demographics; we are looking to drive higher product adoption at the start with our new customers.

And we are looking to bring in higher lifetime value customers.

 

We're seeing some of that play out now in some of the trends that you've seen today, including across the financial services, offerings, Cash App Card and some of those core offerings that have become a bigger part of our product adoption earlier on in the customers lifecycle.

We're pairing, we are being disciplined in our spend.

 

We're focused on the channels that we have the most confidence in and in driving the greatest returns, and are prepared to be flexible on that moving forward.

Ultimately, we think there's a tremendous opportunity from an actives perspective to continue our growth here.

 

If you think about digital natives, Gen Z millennial customers, though they make up a significant portion of Cash App customers, we are still only penetrated into 20% of Gen Z and Millennial customers as the US population.

As we shared at our Investor Day in March, this is the fastest growing demographic for us in monthly actives over the past few years.

 

But there's so much more we can do here to bring the other 80% in the Cash App over time too.

Your next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.

 



Michael Ng

Great, thank you very much for the question.

 

I was just wondering if you could expand on the inflows strategy for Cash App.

It was really encouraging to hear the stable inflows per active despite the tough comps.

 

And I believe that the year-over-year declines in July.

So could you talk a little bit about things on the roadmap to drive inflows and direct deposit actives for next year for instance?

 

Are there any meaningful improvements to drive engagement on Cash App taxes for next spring?

And then as a quick follow up, I was just wondering if you could update us on the direct deposit monthly actives number.

 

I think that was one and a half at the beginning of the year.

Thank you.

 



Amrita Ahuja 

Sure, I'm happy to get started maybe with framing up our inflows framework, and then we'll dive into some of the greater detail on direct deposit.

 

So the inflows framework, again, active inflows per active monetization rate, you can think of the key drivers as inflows per active being the spending power of our customers, and then our share of wallet of our customers.

And so there's sort of two variables for us to think about.

 

They're both in terms of the customers that make up the mix of customers on our platform, and then our ability to engage those customers across our products.

What we've seen in the third quarter, as continued stability and enclosed per active at over $1,000.

 

But growth on a three-year CAGR basis at 17%, which we've seen for most of this year, that growth in the mid-teens, is really encouraging healthy trends across our Cash App customer base.

Even as we move past those periods of stimulus and tax refunds, we think ultimately, there's so much more room to grow these inflows per active number by having multiple inflow channels, and cross selling more of our products to our customers, specifically, these financial services products like Cash App Card and direct deposit.

 

And with direct deposit as we noted $2 billion in September of direct deposit volumes, those volumes grew by more than 65% year-over-year in September, as we've begun to reduce the friction on account creation after customers sign up for their Cash App Card.

So this is a key focus for us as we continue with our strategy of enabling our banking products to our customers, Cash Up Card a big part of it, direct deposit, another key part of it, and as a result, direct deposit plus paper money deposit, which is another inflow channel we've opened up, growing as a share of total inflows making up more than 14% of inflows in September versus 9% a year ago.

 



Jack Dorsey

Sorry, I just wanted to follow up there.

 

In terms of the roadmap ahead, a lot of what you saw with what we did over the past year with the navigation is meant to exactly bring more of this to life, so that it's even more accessible, and easier to find how to turn on direct deposit.

For instance, if you get a Cash App Card now you instantly have a direct deposit number.

 

So there's a number of things we can do to optimize for what we're doing in the interface itself, so that people are more aware that we have this offering in the first place.

And we will continue to add features and products that also coexist with existing ones that people are using.

 

We have to keep in mind that a lot of people in Cash App start with this very simple, I receive money from a friend or family member or I want to send money to a friend or family member.

And then it's our opportunity to really showcase everything else we have to offer, including the Cash App Card, including direct deposit, including Cash App taxes, and the easier we make that and the more tips we add in the interface, the more compelling the outcome we will have.

Your next question comes from line of Rayna Kumar with UBS.

 



Rayna Kumar

Good afternoon.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

I'm curious to understand the progress you've made in combining two powerful ecosystems Cash App Pay and Afterpay.

 

How is organic growth of Cash App trended and what are the next steps for full integration here?



Jack Dorsey

Yes, so our big focus here is on commerce.

 

And linking our two ecosystems through Afterpay is the most compelling option that we found in the market.

We believe that this is a perfect blend of everything that we can offer to sellers, including a way for them to drive more sales, and also new discovery and new opportunities for customers, which also helps them discover Square merchants and merchants all around the world, especially when you consider online commerce and digital commerce.

 

So our long-term vision is to build a more dynamic checkout experience, which enables a much more fluid checkout than what you see today.

We recently introduced the Discover tab in a Cash App.

 

See this as a complete start.

Our goal here was to introduce people to the concept, we're not there yet, with the experience.

 

Think of this as more of a search engine that we're trying to optimize and iterate super-fast on to make sure that when people go there, they're looking for something or we can display relevant content based on their location.

And it gets more and more efficient, more effective, and ultimately leads to a purchase.

 

So that is our goal.

We're just starting a lot of that work right now.

 

And we intend to make it a place that is instantly relevant over time.

And this will take some time.

 

But this is a -- this will really unlock a lot of what we hope to unlock in both the Cash App ecosystem and the Square ecosystem and be beneficial to our Square sellers.

But also more broadly for the Cash App customers as well.

Your next question is from Trevor Williams with Jefferies.

 



Trevor Williams

Great, thanks.

 

Good afternoon.

I want to ask a follow up on margins, particularly in seller or Square is with more of the growth they're coming from larger merchants and then international, which I think both are higher CAC.

 

How should we think of the growth versus margin trade off there if there is one?

Is there still more that you need to do to invest behind either those markets, whether it's the salesforce or brand marketing, just trying to get it ultimately what you expect the margin impact to be over time as the mix continues to skew more towards international and larger sellers.

 

Thanks so much.



Amrita Ahuja 

Hey, Trevor, I can kick off here.

 

So look, our Square business is a fairly high structural margin business as we shared at Investor Day at a 69% structural margin in 2021.

We can take a significant portion of every dollar of top line growth drops down to profitability, where we are orienting our priorities is where we are seeing the strongest returns in terms of our growth, whether it's omni channel products, moving upmarket, with larger sellers, our mid-market sellers are now 40% of our GPV, growing at 22%, year-over-year, and international, which also growing 40%.

 

And some of the key products that underpin growth with larger sellers, like critical points of sale, growing at 45%, year-over-year, so each of those strategic priorities for our Square business that we're investing behind, are driving stronger growth in the overall base.

Now, we expect in 2023 to moderate the pace of some of our investments across sales and marketing and product development in order to continue to that balance that growth and profitability as we spoke about earlier whether it's across hiring, sales and marketing, where we would be pulling back on some of that brand marketing, and have a stable to increasing mix of our investments on things like sales teams, as we focus on optimization.

 

And as we focus on building with our upmarket sellers, bringing more of those larger sellers onto our platform, as well as our product development investments, where we're really expanding the reach of our platform and the cohesiveness of our platform.

So we can take the work off our sellers’ plates and focus on some of the key products that are truly resonating, as you hear today, the vertical solutions, the developer platform, or omni channel software.

 

So those are some of the key focus areas for us, of course, we want to remain agile with our spend and be responsive to what we see in a potentially changing macro environment.

But we are seeing traction in the areas where we are most strategically oriented.

 
Operator

Your next question is from line of Josh Beck with KeyBanc.

 



Josh Beck

Thanks for taking the question.

 

I have actually a follow up along those lines as well.

For the Square stellar business, obviously, you made a pretty substantial investment last year, in outbound sales, you've obviously had more time to see the payback and obviously, blend that with the other go to market strategy.

 

So as you look forward to ‘23 based on how the lessons that you've learned, how important is that outbound motion within the Square go to market.



Amrita Ahuja 

Hey, Josh, happy to double click on this and maybe I'll address more broadly our go-to-market approach for the Square business.

 

So our focus, maintaining target paybacks of about a six-quarter payback, and target returns of about 3x ROI as we evolve our go-to-market strategy to support the growth of market.

Throughout 2022, we pull back on some of the lower ROI areas, and we calibrated our spending mix to the channels with more proven ROI.

 

So what does that look like across each of the areas?

From a sales perspective, we're focused on optimizing our sales channel, which was more predictable returns and where we have the ability to measure performance, we believe our sales team, it will ultimately be a long-term core engine of growth for the business.

 

And there's kind of three key strategies for enhancing our growth up market using our sales team.

One is the verticalization as a team, so creating pods around specific verticals, retail restaurant services, where you see we are gaining traction with our vertical points of sale today to enable those account executives to go deeper, and the needs that are specific to each of those verticals.

 

Second, expanding our outbound sourcing capabilities, so that we can reach out and make sure that these larger sellers have a better understanding of all the many things that Square can do for them today.

And then third, introducing more automation into our tooling to enable our sales team to have better information as they're reaching out to the sellers, which ultimately then can help drive greater efficiency.

 

From an international perspective, our four most tenured international markets are pacing at these healthy payback periods that we're targeting.

Our three more recently launched markets in the last 18 months do have longer payback periods, whether we're looking at it end marketing or sales, as we're introducing our ecosystem into those markets, and building our awareness.

 

From a performance marketing perspective, this is really the core engine which continues to drive stable proven returns and historically has been a significant driver of acquisition.

So that's really giving you an orientation of our overall go-to-market efforts with sales is a key piece of that.

 
Operator

Your next question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.

 



Ramsey Assal

Hi, thank you so much for taking my question tonight.

 

I wanted to ask about convertible solutions and whether there is a long-term roadmap to expand the number of verticals that you support.

And then separately, I just wanted to ask Amrita about the potential to maybe more actively leverage the customer account balances to drive more fluid income.

 

It looks like you guys used to keep more cash, more funds in the money market versus sitting in cash.

I'm just curious if that's something that we could see more of in the future to drive some interest income.

 

Thanks.



Jack Dorsey

So yes, there are three vertical point of sales right now.

 

And services are Square for Restaurant, Square for Retail and Appointments.

We're always looking for opportunities to first and foremost, expand these and add more features, add more services to each one, to continue to make sure that we're serving the need for the particular service, but also looking for other opportunities for more vertical services.

 

But first and foremost, it's making sure that we remain competitive, and we're ahead in terms of our feature set, and making sure that we're continuing to work to optimize these services for our customers.

The other thing that we've talked about in the past on these calls is one trend we continue to see is that the vertical aspects of these things tend to blur a little bit, we see restaurants adding retail like services and appointment type businesses adding or merging with like restaurant type services or retail as well.

 

So the benefit of our ecosystem is we're not focused on just one.

We're focused on all three and more generally, how you operate a business, how you operate, operate a team, and ensuring that we're giving you tools no matter what business you choose to be in to make the sale and make more sales ultimately.

 

So that is our goal.

Every day answering the question, how do we help sellers make more sales.

 

In some cases, these vertical efforts make more sense.

But the most compelling trend that we're -- that we continue to see is the blending of all these things.

 

And that's where our ecosystem mindset really shows us strength.



Amrita Ahuja 

And, Ramsey, just to follow up on your question on float or interest income, the majority of our cash in our customer funds is variable to interest rate fluctuations via a pretty diversified portfolio of accounts, the vast majority of which are relatively short term, which allows us to capitalize on increasing yields.

 

So in the third quarter, interest income increased as a result of obviously higher interest rates.

And we expect to continue to benefit as some of -- as many of our investments lag on interest income pickup, just to maybe break that down for you across our corporate balance sheet and customer funds.

 

From a corporate balance sheet standpoint, interest income was $15 million in the third quarter.

That's up from you $9 million in the second, $8 million and the first, majority of our cash here is variable as I said that interest rate fluctuations either via fixed income, T bills, government money, market accounts or non-interest-bearing accounts that earn an earnings credit rate and much of that interest income -- this interest income flows through to the interest income and expense line which is below the EBITDA line.

 

From a customer funds standpoint, Cash App customer funds does generate interest income as well.

We had $7 million in the third quarter up from less than a million in each of the first and second quarters.

 

Majority of these funds are invested in very short-term accounts and money market accounts and they flow through Cash App revenue and gross profit lines.
Operator

Your final question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist securities.

 



Andrew Jeffrey

Hi, good afternoon.

 

Appreciate you squeezing me in here toward the end.

I wanted to ask about the Square business and the competitive environment and how much of the growth is coming from competitive takeaways?

 

Who are the companies that you generally see at the point of sale?

How much is net new business creation?

 

Just trying to get a sense of kind of the way the markets evolving competitively and how you think you're positioned?



Amrita Ahuja 

Hey, Andrew, maybe I can kick us off here.

 

What we see is stability in our trend lines.

it's a -- it'll depend on each product as to who our competitors are.

 

We don't see a competitor out there who has a threat that we have across our ecosystem.

And really, it's that diversity of products, vertical channels and customer types that we have that we believe is the most resilient, particularly as we may be entering a volatile time from the macro perspective.

 

So what we have saw in the Square ecosystem through October is relative stability, from Q3 and October, or to into Q4, with GPV through October, in the US, and particularly for some of those discretionary verticals, which we are paying particularly close attention to, retail, restaurant, services on a three-year CAGR basis, with stability.

Now, of course, from an international perspective we don't see this as a necessarily competitive issue.

 

But from a FX perspective, we're seeing some headwinds there, as are many other companies.

And from a macro perspective, as we noted in the UK, but more broadly, when you look at the Square ecosystem, ex PPP, as we noted, which was a non-recurring benefit in Q4, and ex BNPL, we see stable rates of year-over-year growth in Square gross profit from Q3 into Q4.

 

And again from a competitive perspective, we believe we're fairly differentiated given the diversity of customer types and product types that we serve.



Jack Dorsey

Yes, I would say that I'm, generally there's certainly areas across our verticals or across some of our products, where we're behind competition.

 

And somewhere we're ahead but on the net, I think as Amrita said, we're much further ahead over the long term, because of that ecosystem mindset.

And because of the breadth of the tools that we offer, and most importantly, how easily they integrate together.

 

It's literally a button push to turn things on or off.

And that includes a wide array of services from lending to customer relationship management to vertical points of sale, to hardware.

 

So this is where I think things really matter is a business no longer has to go vendor to vendor to vendor, but they can come to one place, they can come to Square, and they see pretty much everything they need.

It does mean that we are going to be slightly slower in rolling out all the features for each one particular vertical.

 

But it also balances that with a much higher quality of integration, which ultimately ends up taking a whole ton of, it gives a whole ton of time back to the seller.

So that we see much, much better retention than a lot of our peers.

 

At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to the company for closing remarks.

Tim Cook

Thank you, Saori.

 

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us.

Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $81.8 billion for the June quarter, better than our expectations.

 

We continued to see strong results in emerging markets, driven by robust sales of iPhone with June quarter total revenue records in India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE.

We set June quarter records in a number of other countries as well, including France, the Netherlands and Austria.

 

And we set an all-time revenue record in Services driven by more than $1 billion paid subscriptions.

We continued to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including nearly 4 percentage points of foreign exchange headwinds.

 

On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to the prior year's quarter in aggregate and in the majority of markets we track.

We continue to manage deliberately and innovate relentlessly, and we are driven by the sense of possibility those efforts inspire.

 

To that end, before I turn to the quarter in more detail, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented innovations we were proud to announce at our Worldwide Developers Conference.

In addition to extraordinary new Macs and incredible updates to our software platforms, we had the chance to introduce the world to spatial computing.

 

We were so pleased to share the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro with the world, a bold new product unlike anything else created before.

Apple Vision Pro is a marvel of engineering, built on decades of innovation only possible at Apple.

 

It is the most advanced personal electronic device ever created, and we've been thrilled by the reaction from press, analysts, developers and content creators who've had the chance to try it.

We can't wait to get it into customers' hands early next year.

 

Now let me share more with you on our June quarter results beginning with iPhone.

iPhone revenue came in at $39.7 billion for the quarter, down 2% from the year ago quarter's record performance.

 

On a constant currency basis, iPhone revenue grew, and we had a June quarter record for switchers, reflecting the popularity of the iPhone lineup.

iPhone 14 customers continue to praise the exceptional battery life and essential health and safety features, while iPhone 14 Plus users are loving the new larger screen size.

 

And with Dynamic Island, Always-On display and the most powerful camera system ever in an iPhone, the iPhone 14 Pro lineup is our best ever.

Turning to Mac.

 

We recorded $6.8 billion in revenue, down 7% year-over-year.

We are proud to have completed the transition of our entire Mac lineup to run exclusively on Apple silicon.

 

We are also excited to have introduced the new 15-inch MacBook Air during the quarter, the world's best 15-inch laptop and one of the best Macs we've ever made.

And we launched 2 new powerhouses in computing, Mac Studio with M2 Max and M2 Ultra and Mac Pro with M2 Ultra, which are the most powerful Macs we've ever made.

 

iPad revenue was $5.8 billion for the June quarter, down 20% year-over-year, in part due to a difficult compare because of the timing of the iPad Air launch last year.

Customers are loving iPad's versatility and exceptional value.

 

There was a great deal of excitement from creatives when we brought Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro to iPad this spring.

And with the back-to-school season in full swing, iPad has the power to help students tackle the toughest assignments.

 

Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $8.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year and in line with our expectations.

Packed with features to empower users to live a healthier life, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Ultra continue to help people take the next step on their wellness journey.

 

As I mentioned earlier, last quarter, we held our biggest and most exciting WWDC yet.

We were thrilled to welcome developers from across the globe to Apple Park, both in person and virtually, and to share some stunning new announcements with the world.

 

In addition to Apple Vision Pro and the new Macs that we introduced, we had the chance to reveal some truly remarkable new innovations to our software platforms.

From exciting new features like Live Voicemail and StandBy in iOS 17, to new tools for users to work, play and personalize their experience in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17, to a fresh design and new workout capabilities in watchOS 10, there's so much coming later this year to empower users to get more out of their devices, and we think they're going to instantly love these new features.

 

It was also an exciting quarter for Services where revenue reached $21.2 billion and saw a sequential acceleration to an 8% year-over-year increase, better than we expected.

We set an all-time revenue record for total services and in a number of categories, including video, AppleCare, cloud and payment services.

 

Since we introduced Apple Pay almost a decade ago, customers have been loving how easy it is to make purchases online, in apps and in stores.

We're also pleased to see Apple Card build on the success of Apple Pay.

 

Designed with our users' financial health in mind, Apple Card has become one of the most successful credit card programs in the U.S.

with award-winning customer satisfaction.

 

And this spring, we introduced a new high-yield savings account for Apple Card customers, which has become incredibly popular, with customers already making more than $10 billion in deposits.

Meanwhile, Apple TV+ continues to provide a spectacular showcase of imaginative storytelling.

 

Recently, fans welcomed new series like Hijack and Silo as well as returning fan favorites like Foundation and The Afterparty.

In the few years since its launch, Apple TV+ has earned more than 1,500 nominations and 370 wins.

 

That includes the 54 Emmy Award nominations across 13 titles that Apple TV+ received last month.

It's also been an exciting time for sports on Apple TV+.

 

Soccer legend Lionel Messi made his debut with Major League Soccer last month, and fans all over the world tuned in with MLS Season Pass.

We are excited about our MLS partnership, and we're thrilled to see Messi suiting up with Inter Miami.

 

And just in time for summer concert season, Apple Music launched new discovery features celebrating live music, including venue guides in Apple Maps and set lists from tours of major artists.

These new features and others join a lineup of updates coming later this year to make Services more powerful, more useful and more fun than ever.

 

Everything we do is in service of our customers, and retail is where we bring the best of Apple.

During the quarter, we opened the Apple Store online in Vietnam, and we're excited to connect with more customers there.

 

We also redesigned our first-ever Apple Store located in Tysons Corner, Northern Virginia, with inclusive, innovative and sustainable design enhancements.

We opened a beautiful new store beneath our new London headquarters in the historic Battersea Power Station.

 

And the performance of the stores we opened in India this spring exceeded our initial expectations.

With every product we create, every feature we develop and every interaction we share with our customers, we lead with the values we stand for.

 

We believe in creating technology that serves all of humanity, which is why accessibility has always been a core value that we embed in everything we do.

On Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we unveiled some extraordinary new tools for cognitive, vision, hearing and mobile accessibility that will be available later this year, including Assistive Access, which distills apps to their most essential features, and Personal Voice, which allows users to create a synthesized voice that sounds just like them.

 

Building technology and service of our customers also means protecting their privacy, which we believe is a fundamental human right.

That's why we were pleased to announce major updates to Safari Private Browsing, Communication Safety and Lockdown Mode to further safeguard our users.

 

And as part of our efforts to build a better world, we announced that we've more than doubled our initial commitment to our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative to more than $200 million.

We will continue to do our part to support education, economic empowerment and criminal justice reform work.

 

And while supporting efforts to advance equity and opportunity, we continue to build a culture of belonging at Apple and a workforce that reflects the communities we serve.

Through our environmental work, we're making strides in our commitment to leave the world better than we found it.

 

Last month, Apple joined with global nonprofit Acumen in a new effort to improve livelihoods in India through clean energy innovation, and we are as committed as ever to our Apple 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across our entire supply chain and the life cycle of our products.

We've long held that education is the great equalizer.

 

With that in mind, we're expanding Apple Learning Coach, a free professional learning program that teaches educators how to get more out of Apple technology in the classroom.

Today, we welcome more than 1,900 educators across the U.S.

 

to the program.

By the end of the year, we'll offer Apple Learning Coach in 12 more countries.

 

As we're connecting with teachers, we're also celebrating the graduations of students at our app developer academies around the world.

From Detroit, to Naples, to Riyadh and more, we're excited to watch these talented developers embark on careers in coding and find ways to make a positive difference in their communities.

 

Apple remains a champion of innovation, a company fueled by boundless creativity, driven by a deep sense of mission and guided by the unshakable belief that a great idea can change the world.

Looking ahead, we'll continue to manage for the long term, always pushing the limits of what's possible and always putting the customer at the center of everything we do.

 

With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.



Luca Maestri

Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone.

 

Revenue for the June quarter was $81.8 billion, down 1% from last year and better than our expectations despite nearly 4 percentage points of negative impact from foreign exchange.

On a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total and in the majority of the markets we track.

 

We set June quarter records in both Europe and Greater China and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets driven by iPhone.

Products revenue was $60.6 billion, down 4% from last year, as we faced FX headwinds and an uneven macroeconomic environment.

 

However, our installed base reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, driven by a June quarter record for iPhone switchers and high new-to rates in Mac, iPad and Watch, coupled with very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Our Services revenue set an all-time record of $21.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year and grew double digits in constant currency.

 

Our performance was strong around the world as we reach all-time Services revenue records in Americas and Europe and June quarter records in Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific.

Company gross margin was 44.5%, a record level for the June quarter and up 20 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix shift towards Services, partially offset by a seasonal loss of leverage.

 

Products gross margin was 35.4%, down 130 basis points from last quarter due to seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs.

Services gross margin was 70.5%, decreasing 50 basis points sequentially.

 

Operating expenses of $13.4 billion were below the low end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and decelerated from the March quarter.

We continue to take a deliberate approach in managing our spend with strong focus on innovation and new product development.

 

The results of these actions delivered net income of $19.9 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.26, up 5% versus last year, and very strong operating cash flow of $26.4 billion.

Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories.

 

iPhone revenue was $39.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year but grew on a constant currency basis.

We set revenue records in several markets around the world, including an all-time record in India and June quarter records in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Indonesia, the Philippines, Italy, the Netherlands and the U.K.

 

Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, thanks to a June quarter record in switchers.

This is a testament to our extremely high levels of customer satisfaction, which 451 Research recently measured at 98% for the iPhone 14 family in the U.S.

 

Mac generated $6.8 billion in revenue, down 7% year-over-year.

We continue to invest in our Mac portfolio.

 

And this past quarter, we were pleased to complete the transition to Apple silicon for the entire lineup.

This transition has driven both strong upgrade activity and a high number of new customers.

 

In fact, almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product.

We also saw reported customer satisfaction of 96% for Mac in the U.S.

 

iPad revenue was $5.8 billion, down 20% year-over-year and in line with our expectations.

These results were driven by a difficult compare against the full quarter impact of the iPad Air launch in the prior year.

 

At the same time, we continue to attract a large number of new customers to the iPad installed base with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product.

And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S.

 

Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $8.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year, with a June quarter record in Greater China and strong performance in several emerging markets.

We continue to see Apple Watch expand its reach with about 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.

 

And this is combined with very high levels of customer satisfaction, which was recently reported at 98% in the United States.

Moving on to Services.

 

We reached a new all-time revenue record of $21.2 billion with year-over-year growth accelerating sequentially to 8% and up double digits in constant currency.

In addition to the all-time records Tim mentioned earlier, we also set June quarter records for advertising, App Store and Music.

 

We are very pleased with our performance in Services, which is a direct reflection of our ecosystem's strength.

First, our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem.

 

Second, we see increased customer engagement with our services.

Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high.

 

Third, our paid subscriptions showed strong growth.

This past quarter, we reached an important milestone and passed 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months and nearly double the number of paid subscriptions we had only 3 years ago.

 

And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services.

From 20 new games on Apple Arcade, to brand-new content on Apple TV+, to the launch of our high-yield savings account with Apple Card, our customers are loving these enhanced offerings.

 

Turning to the enterprise market.

Our customers are leveraging Apple products every day to help improve productivity and attract talent.

 

Blackstone, a global investment management firm, is expanding its Apple footprint from their corporate iPhone fleet to now offering the MacBook Air powered by M2 to all of their corporate employees and portfolio companies.

Gilead, a leading biopharmaceutical company, has deployed thousands of iPads globally to their sales team.

 

Over the last 6 months, they have also doubled their Mac user base by making MacBook Air available to more employees with a focus on user experience and strong security.

Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program.

 

We ended the quarter with over $166 billion in cash and marketable securities.

We repaid $7.5 billion in maturing debt while issuing $5.2 billion of new debt and increasing commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $109 billion.

 

As a result, net cash was $57 billion at the end of the quarter.

During the quarter, we returned over $24 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $18 billion through open market repurchases of 103 million Apple shares.

 

We continue to believe there is great value in our stock and maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.

As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Saori referred to at the beginning of the call.

 

We expect our September quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the June quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.

Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of over 2 percentage points.

 

We expect iPhone and Services year-over-year performance to accelerate from the June quarter.

Also, we expect the revenue for both Mac and iPad to decline by double digits year-over-year due to difficult compares, particularly on the Mac.

 

For both products, we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter a year ago and were able to fulfill significant pent-up demand in the year ago September quarter.

We expect gross margin to be between 44% and 45%.

 

We expect OpEx to be between $13.5 billion and $13.7 billion.

We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%.

 

Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on August 17, 2023, to shareholders of record as of August 14, 2023.

With that, let's open the call to questions.

 



Saori Casey

Thank you, Luca.

 

[Operator Instructions].

Operator, may we have the first question, please?

 
Operator

[Operator Instructions].

 

We will go ahead and take our first question from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse.



Shannon Cross

Tim, you mentioned -- and actually, Luca, too, you mentioned an uneven macro environment during the quarter several times on the call.

 

I'm wondering if you can talk on a geographic basis about some of the trends you're seeing in iPhone.

I'm specifically wondering how demand is trending within...

 



Luca Maestri

Sure.

 

Shannon, I'll answer it.

I didn't get the end of your question.

 
Operator

I think she has dropped.

 



Luca Maestri

Okay.

 

Well, let me answer the question for the part that I could follow.

So on a geographic basis, we've had great performance for iPhone in emerging markets.

 

We set June quarter records in many of the emerging markets.

We grew in total double digits.

 

And the performance was strong across the board in emerging markets from China, where our performance improved from minus 3% to plus 8% in the June quarter and we grew double digits in constant currency, to many other areas around the world from India, where, again, we set a June quarter record with very strong performance there, Indonesia, Southeast Asia, in general, Latin America, Middle East.

And so it's been really good there.

 

We -- also, as you can see from our geographic segments, we had a slight acceleration of performance in the Americas, primarily in the United States, but we declined there because the smartphone market has been in a decline for the last couple of quarters in the United States.



Shannon Cross

Sorry about that.

 

I'm not sure why I cut off.

In terms of gross margin, you were at the high end of the range [Technical Difficulty] and you guided to 45% at the high end, which is, I think, higher than I remember in 20 years of covering you.

 

So how should we think about puts and takes of gross margin?

And it seems like there's like a perfect storm of good things.

 

So I just -- maybe if you can talk about how you're thinking about it more holistically.



Luca Maestri

I think you remember correctly, Shannon, because the 44.5% for the June quarter is an all-time record for us in June.

 

We were up 20 basis points sequentially.

It was driven by cost savings and a mix shift towards Services, which obviously helps company gross margins, partially offset by the seasonal loss of leverage.

 

We have a commodity environment that is favorable to us.

Our product mix is quite strong at this point.

 

And so with the exception of foreign exchange, which continues to be a drag, and it was a significant drag on a year-over-year basis, yes, we are in a good position right now.

We are in a good position for the June quarter.

 

And as I mentioned, we expect similar level of gross margins for the same reasons, frankly, for the September quarter.
Operator

Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.

 



Wamsi Mohan

Luca, can you just give us a little more color around the guidance?

 

Your overall revenue performance, you called out similar.

Obviously, you absorbed a higher FX impact this quarter versus your guide.

 

And you also noted Services acceleration.

So just wondering, when you think about that comment on iPhone acceleration, is that on a reported basis?

 

Is that constant currency basis?

And is there something that's changing in terms of seasonality perhaps for you that is causing not as much step-up in product revenue as typical on a sequential basis?

 

And I have a follow-up.



Luca Maestri

Yes.

 

So all our comments are in reported currency, not in constant currency in relation to the outlook.

And we said acceleration sequentially for iPhone and for Services.

 

But we're also pointing out -- and this is where I think, Wamsi, you're referring to some seasonality issues.

We also said that for Mac and iPad, we expect to decline double digits.

 

And the reason for that is that we have a very difficult compare versus last year.

You remember that a year ago, in the June quarter, we had factory shutdowns for both Mac and iPad.

 

And so we were able to fill the pent-up demand from those shutdowns during the September quarter.

So an unusual level of activity that we had a year ago.

 

And so now, obviously, the compare is difficult.

So we expect both iPad and Mac to be down double digits, which offset the acceleration that I mentioned for iPhone and Services.

 



Wamsi Mohan

Okay.

 

And Tim, I was wondering if you could update us on what percent of iPhones are sold on some type of installment basis now versus full upfront payment on a global basis.

And maybe some thoughts on if you expect similar promotional activity from carriers, especially in the U.S., that seem to be grappling with a lot of cash flow issues this particular year.

 



Luca Maestri

Wamsi, I'll take it.

 

We've done a really good job over the last few years with affordability programs around the world directly in our direct channel and with our partners around the world.

The majority of iPhones, at this point, are sold using some kind of a program, trade-ins, installments, some kind of financing.

 

And that percentage, which again, it's well over 50%, is very similar across developed and emerging markets.

We want to do more of that because we think it really helps reduce the affordability threshold for our products.

 

And we think it is also one of the reasons why our product mix has been very strong during the last couple of cycles.

So we will continue to push on that front.

 
Operator

Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS.

 



David Vogt

I just wanted to follow up on 2 points that both you, Tim, and Luca made about growth and maybe commodities.

 

So just to be clear, I know you're talking about an acceleration in iPhone, but the comp is about 2 points easier from FX.

So I just want to understand, is that on a like-for-like basis, excluding the currency improvement of about 2 points from the June quarter to the September quarter?

 

And from a commodity perspective, I know last quarter, you talked about buying a lot of inventory at favorable prices, which was an incredibly smart strategy.

Where do you sit today?

 

And what's sort of the timing or the duration of that commodity sort of backlog that you have as we think about next quarter and the subsequent quarters?

How far does that get you out into the future from this favorable cost dynamic?

 



Luca Maestri

Let me start again.

 

I just want to be clear about the guidance, the outlook guidance that we provided.

We're referring entirely to reported numbers.

 

So they take into account the fact that we have a slight improvement in foreign exchange.

So when I talk about similar performance, I refer to reported performance in the June quarter and then the reported performance in the September quarter.

 

And again, we expect, on a reported basis, our iPhone performance to accelerate, our Services performance to accelerate, and iPad and Mac to decline double digits.

On the commodity front, as I mentioned, the environment is favorable.

 

We always make sure that we take advantage of the opportunities that are available in the market, and we will continue to do that going forward.



David Vogt

Luca, any sense of how long that gives you a run rate today based on what you currently have?

 

Can you give us a sense for at least the short-term tailwind?



Luca Maestri

I don't want to speculate past the September quarter because that's the horizon where we provide guidance.

 

And I've said that the guidance for September is 44% to 45%, which you know is historically very high.

And so obviously, that reflects a favorable environment for us.

 
Operator

Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.

 



Erik Woodring

I have 2 as well.

 

Maybe if we just start kind of big picture, Tim or Luca.

I was wondering if you could just kind of share some incremental color on how you think the consumer is behaving today versus 90 days ago and maybe how that differs by region.

 

Meaning, are there any signs that consumer is incrementally more willing to spend on things like consumer electronics?

Or is there still relative caution in the market?

 

Are there any regions where you're seeing more strength in the consumer?

And how sustainable do you think some of that strength or weakness could be based on some of the KPIs you track?

 

And then I have a follow-up.



Tim Cook

Yes.

 

David, it's Tim.

If you sort of step around the world, we did exceptionally well in emerging markets last quarter and even better on a constant currency basis.

 

And so emerging markets were -- was a strength.

If you look at China, in China, we went from a negative 3% in Q2 to a plus 8% in Q3.

 

And so in China, we had an acceleration.

If you look at the U.S., which is in the -- obviously in the Americas segment, it is the vast majority of what's in there, there was also a slight acceleration sequentially, although the Americas is still declining somewhat year-over-year, as you can see on the data sheet.

 

The primary reason for that is that it's a challenging smartphone market in the U.S.

currently.

 

And then in Europe, Europe saw a record quarter and -- for the June quarter, a record.

And so some really good signs in most places in the world.

 



Erik Woodring

Awesome.

 

And then maybe, Luca, a question for you.

I think it's been about 3 quarters now where we've seen OpEx either grow below historical seasonality or come in below your expectations.

 

I think this is the first time we've seen R&D grow less than 10% year-over-year since fiscal 2Q 2007.

So can you maybe just talk about some of the cost actions you're taking?

 

And as you look forward, what are the indicators that you're really evaluating that would give you greater confidence in perhaps returning back to a more seasonal cadence of OpEx spending?

Or is this just a new normal that we should be expecting?

 

That's it for me.



Luca Maestri

Obviously, we look at the environment, and we know that this has been an uncertain period for the last few quarters.

 

And so we decided to be deliberate in what we do in terms of controlling our spend, and there's many areas across the company that we're working on and we've been quite effective at slowing down the spend.

We slowed down also the hiring within the company in several areas.

 

And we're very pleased with our ability to decelerate some of the expense growth taking into account the overall macro situation.

We will continue to manage deliberately.

 

You can see that we continue to grow our R&D costs faster than the rest of the company.

SG&A is actually growing at a much slower pace because obviously, our focus continues to be in innovation and product development, and we'll continue to do that.

 
Operator

Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.

 



Michael Ng

I just have 2 questions as well.

 

First, it was encouraging to see the Services outperformance in the quarter, up double digits on an FX-neutral basis, and more Services acceleration next quarter on a reported basis.

I was just wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about key underlying drivers for the confidence in the Services acceleration next quarter, understanding that FX a little bit.

 

But anything to call out as it relates to things in Apple Search Ads that's helping.

You're obviously making a lot of investments in Apple TV+ between MLS and the Canal+ deal.

 

So any thoughts there would be great.



Luca Maestri

Yes, Michael, you're correct.

 

I mean clearly, we've seen an improvement in the June quarter, and we expect further improvement in the September quarter.

In June, the performance was across the board.

 

Tim and I mentioned we set records really across the board.

We had all-time records in cloud, in video, in AppleCare, in payments and June quarter records in App Store, advertising and Music.

 

So we saw improvement in all our Services categories.

We think the situation will continue to improve as we go through September.

 

And that's very positive because not only good for the financial results, but obviously, it shows a high level of engagement of our customers in the ecosystem, which is very important for us.

And it's really the sum of all the things that I mentioned in my prepared remarks.

 

It goes from the fact that our installed base continues to grow, so we've got a larger pool of customers, to the fact that our customers are more engaged as we have more transacting accounts and paid accounts on the ecosystem.

And the subscriptions business is very healthy with growth of 150 million paid subscriptions just in the last 12 months.

 

It's almost double to what we had 3 years ago.

And of course, we are providing more and more content to our users.

 

And so the combination of all these things gives us good confidence for September.



Michael Ng

Great.

 

And just as a related follow-up, it's about the hardware installed base and Services ARPU.

I was curious when you talked about the Services strength, you talked about the 2 billion-plus installed base.

 

When you think about the opportunity to increase the Services ARPU, do you really think about it internally on a per-active-iPhone user basis or on a per-device basis?

Said differently, I'm just curious where you think about -- whether you think there's an incremental opportunity for those users that have multiple devices.

 

Do you really see a big Services ARPU uplift in that respect?



Luca Maestri

Well, we know that customers that own more than one device are typically more engaged in our ecosystem.

 

And so obviously, they tend to also spend more on the Services front.

I would say the biggest opportunity is that we know that there's a lot of customers that we have that are very familiar with our ecosystem.

 

They are engaged in the ecosystem.

But still today, they're using only the portion of the ecosystem that is free.

 

And so we think that by offering better content and more content over time, we're going to be able to attract more of them as paid customers.
Operator

Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.

 



Amit Daryanani

I have 2 as well.

 

I guess, Luca, maybe if you can talk about Wearables a bit.

The growth over there, I think, in constant currency was fairly impressive at plus 6%.

 

Can you just touch on maybe what's driving that?

And then how do we think about the Wearables segment heading into the September quarter?

 

I know you talked about a bunch of other ones, but how do we think about Wearables into September as well?



Luca Maestri

Sorry, Amit, I didn't get the -- what are you referring to?

 



Amit Daryanani

Yes.

 

Sorry.

I was hoping you could talk a bit about the Wearables segment because the growth over there was fairly impressive.

 

And then how do you think about it into September as well?



Luca Maestri

Yes.

 

On the Wearables front, we had really good performance in Greater China.

And that's, again, very important for us.

 

It was a June quarter record for Greater China.

Very important for us because, again, it shows that the engagement with the ecosystem in a market that is so important for us like China continues to grow.

 

It means that there's more and more customers that are owning more than the iPhone.

Also, we continue to grow the installed base of the category very quickly because, as I mentioned, 2/3 of every buyer of Apple Watch during the course of the June quarter was new to the product.

 

And so that is all additive to the installed base.

So it's just great to see that the AirPods continue to be a great success in the marketplace for us.

 

And so things are moving in the right direction there.

It's become a very large business for us in Wearables, Home and Accessories.

 

The last 12 months, we've done $40 billion of business, which is nearly the size of a Fortune 100 company.

So it's become very important, and it's allowed us to diversify both our revenues and our earnings.

 



Amit Daryanani

That's really helpful.

 

And then if I could just follow up, the Europe growth, the growth in Europe at up 5% is totally notable as well.

I think you have a few emerging markets that you put in Europe as well.

 

But I would love to understand what's happening in Europe and if there's a way to think about sort of Western Europe or developed world versus emerging markets over there.



Luca Maestri

Yes.

 

It's been very good, primarily on the emerging market side of Europe.

We include India and the Middle East and Central and Eastern Europe into the Europe segment.

 

But as we mentioned at the beginning of the call, we had a number of markets that did very well, like France, like Italy, the Netherlands, Austria.

So it was a good quarter for Europe.

 
Operator

Our next question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.

 



Harsh Kumar

I have one for Luca and then later on one for Tim.

 

So Luca, for some time now, for many quarters, you've had a currency headwind or foreign exchange currency headwind.

It's conceivable that as rates start to come down, hopefully next year that the dollar weakens.

 

Could you take us through the mechanism of how that will work on your revenues and for your costs?



Luca Maestri

So we tend -- we try to hedge our foreign exchange exposures because we think it's the right approach for the company in terms of minimizing the volatility that necessarily happens from the movements of currencies.

 

We cannot effectively hedge every single exposure around the world because in some cases, it is not possible.

In other cases, it is prohibitively expensive.

 

But we tend to cover all the major currency payers that we have.

About 60% of our business is outside the United States.

 

So it's a very, very large and, I would say, very effective hedging program.

And so we set up these hedges, and they tend to roll over very regularly.

 

And then we replace them with new hedges at the new spot rate.

So the impact that we're going to have on revenue and cost will depend on where the spot rates are at different points in time.

 

And therefore, because of the way the program works, tends to be a bit of a lag in both directions as the foreign exchange moves over time.



Harsh Kumar

Understood.

 

Very helpful.

And for Tim, Tim, historically, for the last many years, carriers in at least the U.S., which I think is your largest market for iPhone, have had programs to help folks upgrade, whether they give a cash rebate or you bring in your old phone, something like that.

 

I was curious, as you get into your peak December quarter, if you're aware of these programs are in place.

And the reason why I'm asking is I think earlier, you mentioned that more than 50% of your phones are sold through some kind of program.

 

I assume the number is even higher in the U.S.



Tim Cook

I don't want to get into revealing specifics in the different carriers.

 

But generally speaking, I would think that it would be quite easy to find a promotion on a phone, provided you're hooking up to a service and either switching services, carriers or upgrading your phone at the same carrier.

I think both of those cases today that you can find promotions out there, and I would expect that you'd be able to do that in the December time frame as well.

 
Operator

Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

 



Aaron Rakers

I have two as well.

 

So first of all, I just want to kind of ask Tim.

Strategically, as we think about the Services growth and kind of the content expansion behind that, I'm curious if you could help us maybe appreciate what you've seen from a sporting perspective in terms of the engagement with MLS, the engagement with Major League Baseball, and how strategically you're thinking about expansion in sports as a key driver of Services growth going forward.

 



Tim Cook

We're focused on original content, as you know, with TV+.

 

And so we're all about giving great storytellers the venue to tell great stories and hopefully get us all to think a little deeper.

And sport is a part of that because sport is the ultimate original story.

 

And for MLS, we're -- we could not be happier with how the partnership is going.

It's clearly in the early days, but we are beating our expectation in terms of subscribers, and the fact that Messi went to Inter Miami helped us out there a bit.

 

And so we're very excited about it.



Aaron Rakers

Yes.

 

And as a quick follow-up, I'm just curious, an update on -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks the continued growth that you've seen in India.

I'm curious how we think about that market opportunity looking forward.

 

Is there anything that you see evolving that could accelerate the opportunity for iPhone in that large mobile market?



Tim Cook

We did hit a June quarter revenue record in India, and we grew strong double digits.

 

We also opened our first 2 retail stores during the quarter.

And it's -- of course, it's early going currently, but they're currently beating our expectation in terms of how they're doing.

 

We continue to work on building out the channel and putting more investment in our direct-to-consumer offers as well.

And so I think if you look at it, it's the second largest smartphone market in the world.

 

And it's -- so we ought to be doing really well there.

And where I'm really pleased with our growth there, we're still -- we still have a very, very modest and low share in the smartphone market.

 

And so I think that it's a huge opportunity for us.

And we're putting the -- all of our energies in making that occur.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.

 



Sidney Ho

Your -- I just wanted to ask about the AI side of things.

 

Your strategy on AI seems quite different than many of your peers, at least you don't talk too much about that, how much you invest in it.

Maybe you can elaborate a little bit on that.

 

But related to that, how do you see your investment in this area turning into financial performance in the future?

Is it mainly through faster upgrade cycle, maybe higher ASP?

 

Or are you thinking about maybe additional services that you can capitalize on that?

And then I have a follow-up.

 



Tim Cook

If you take a step back, we view AI and machine learning as core fundamental technologies that are integral to virtually every product that we build.

 

And so if you think about WWDC in June, we announced some features that will be coming in iOS 17 this fall, like Personal Voice and Live Voicemail.

Previously, we had announced lifesaving features like fall detection and crash detection and ECG.

 

None of these features that I just mentioned and many, many more would be possible without AI and machine learning.

And so it's absolutely critical to us.

 

And of course, we've been doing research across a wide range of AI technologies, including generative AI for years.

We're going to continue investing and innovating and responsibly advancing our products with these technologies with the goal of enriching people's lives.

 

And so that's what it's all about for us.

And as you know, we tend to announce things as they come to market, and that's our MO, and I'd like to stick to that.

 



Sidney Ho

Okay.

 

That's fair.

Maybe as a follow-up is related to -- you talked about WWDC, where you actually introduced Vision Pro there.

 

Clearly, a very big announcement there.

How should we think about the revenue ramp related to the Vision Pro?

 

Is there any catalysts that we should be thinking about that will drive an inflection of that product?



Tim Cook

Yes.

 

There's enormous excitement around the Vision Pro.

We're excited internally.

 

Everybody that's been through the demos are blown away, whether you're talking about press or analysts or developers.

We are now shipping units to the developer community for them to begin working on their apps.

 

And we're looking forward to shipping early next year.

And so we could not be more excited with that.

 

I'm using the product daily.

And so we're not going to forecast revenues and so forth on the call today, but we're very excited about it.

 
Operator

We will take our last question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.

 



Krish Sankar

I have two of them as well.

 

Number one, on iPhone, Tim, you mentioned about the record number of switchers in the quarter.

I'm kind of curious how to think about, given the weak macro and consumer spending, how is the replacement cycle for iPhone?

 

Is it similar, longer, shorter versus prior years?

And can you talk a little bit about the demand linearity of iPhone during the June quarter?

 

And then I have a follow-up.



Tim Cook

Switchers were a very key part of our iPhone results for the quarter.

 

We did set a record.

We set a record in Greater China, in particular, and it was at the heart of our results there.

 

And we continue to try to convince more and more people to switch because of our -- the experience and the ecosystem and -- that we can offer them.

And so I think switching is a huge opportunity for us.

 

In terms of the upgrade cycle and so forth, it's very difficult to estimate real time what is going on with the upgrade cycle.

I would say, if you think about the iPhone results year-over-year, you have to think about the SE announcement in the year ago quarter, the iPhone SE announcement in the year ago quarter.

 

And so that provides a bit of a headwind on the comp.

But as Luca said, as he talked about how we're viewing Q4, the September quarter, we see iPhone accelerating in Q4.

 



Krish Sankar

Got it.

 

Very helpful, Tim.

And then my final question is on your retail stores, you obviously have a very large retail footprint and many of your stores seem to have been open for over a year now.

 

How is the foot traffic there?

And how do you think about sales or the retail trends in the June quarter and implications for the back half of this year on a seasonality basis?

 



Tim Cook

I'm sorry, are you talking about our retail stores?

 



Krish Sankar

Yes, yes, your retail stores.

 



Tim Cook

Yes.

 

The -- if you look at retail, it's a key part of our go-to-market approach, and it will be so key and such a competitive advantage with Vision Pro.

It will give us the opportunity to launch a new product and demo to many people in the stores.

 

And so it has many advantages in it.

And we continue to roll out more stores.

 

As you know, we just opened 2 in India last quarter.

We're -- there's still a lot of countries out there that don't have Apple stores that we would like to go into.

 

And so we continue to see it as a key part of how we go to market and love the experience that we can provide customers there.

During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures.

 

You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.

 



Colette Kress

Thanks, Simona.

 

Q3 revenue was $5.93 billion, down 12% sequentially and down 17% year on year.

We delivered record data center and automotive revenue.

 

while our gaming and pro visualization platforms declined as we work through channel inventory corrections and challenging external conditions.

Starting with data center.

 

Revenue of $3.83 billion was up 1% sequentially and 31% year-on-year.

This reflects very solid performance in the face of macroeconomic challenges new export controls and lingering supply chain disruptions.

 

Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by leading U.S.

cloud providers and a broadening set of consumer Internet companies for workloads such as large language models, recommendation systems and generative AI.

 

As the number and scale of public cloud computing and Internet service companies deploying NVIDIA AI grows our traditional hyperscale definition will need to be expanded to convey the different end market use cases.

We will align our data center customer commentary going forward accordingly.

 

Other vertical industries, such as automotive and energy, also contributed to growth with key workloads relating to autonomous driving, high-performance computing, simulations and analytics.

During the quarter, the U.S.

 

government announced new restrictions impacting exports of our A100 and H-100 based products to China, and any product destined for certain systems or entities in China.

These restrictions impacted third quarter revenue, largely offset by sales of alternative products into China.

 

That said, demand in China more broadly remains soft, and we expect that to continue in the current quarter.

We started shipping our flagship 100 data center GPU based on the new hopper architecture in Q3.

 

A100-based systems are available starting this month from leading server makers including Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and SuperMicro.

Early next year, the first H-100 based cloud instances will be available on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

 

A100 delivered the highest performance and workload versatility for both AI training and inference in the latest MLPerf industry benchmarks.

H-100 also delivers incredible value compared to the previous generation for equivalent AI performance it offers three x lower total cost of ownership while using five x fewer server nodes and 3.5 x less energy.

 

Earlier today, we announced a multiyear collaboration with Microsoft to build an advanced cloud-based AI supercomputer to help enterprises train, deploy and scale AI including large state-of-the-art models.

MacBook Azure will incorporate our complete AI stack, adding tens and thousands of A100 and A100 GPUs.

 

Quantum 2 400 gigabit per second InfiniBand networking and the NVIDIA AI enterprise software suite to its platform.

Oracle and NVIDIA are also working together to offer AI training and inference at scale to thousands of enterprises.

 

This includes bringing to Oracle Cloud infrastructure, the full NVIDIA accelerated computing stack and adding tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, including the A100 and H-100.

Cloud-based high-performance in the company, new scale is adopting NVIDIA AI enterprise and other software to address the industrial scientific communities, rising demand for AI in the cloud.

 

NVIDIA AI will bring new capability to rescale high-performance computing as a service offerings, which include simulation and engineering software used across industries.

Networking posted strong growth driven by hyperscale customers and easing supply constraints.

 

-- our new Quantum 240 gigabit per second InfiniBand and Spectrum Ethernet networking platforms are building momentum.

We achieved an important milestone this quarter with VMware.

 

And whose leading server virtualization platform, vSphere, has been rearchitected over the last two years to run on DPUs and now supports our BlueField DPUs.

Our joint enterprise AI platform is available first on Dell PowerEdge servers.

 

The BlueField DPU design win pipeline is growing and the number of infrastructure softer partners is expanding, including Arista, Check Point, Juniper, [Inaudible] Networks and Red Hot.

The latest top 500 list of supercomputers released this week at Supercomputing '22 and has the highest ever number of NVIDIA-powered systems, including 72% of the total and 90% of new systems on the list.

 

Moreover, NVIDIA powers 23 of the top 30 of the Green 500 list, demonstrating the energy efficiency of accelerated computing.

The No.

 

1 most energy-efficient system is the Flat Iron Institute Henry, which is the first top 500 system featuring our H-100 GPUs.

At GTC, we announced the NVIDIA Omniverse Computing System, or OVS, reference designs featuring the new L4 GPU based on the ADA Lovelace architecture.

 

These systems are designed to build and operate 3D virtual world using NVIDIA Omniverse enterprise.

NVIDIA OBX systems will be available from Inspur, Lenovo and Super Micro by early 2023.

 

We Lockheed Martin and Jaguar Land Rover will be among the first customers to receive OVS systems.

We are further expanding our AI software and services offerings with NVIDIA and Bio Nemo large language model services, which are both entering early access this month.

 

These enable developers to easily adopt large language models and deploy customized AI applications for content generation, tech summarization, chatbox, co-development, protein structure and biomolecular property predictions.

Moving to gaming.

 

Revenue of $1.57 billion was down 23% sequentially and down 51% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with current demand expectations.

We believe Channel inventories are on track to approach normal levels as we exit Q4.

 

Sell-through for our gaming products was relatively solid in the Americas and EMEA and but softer in Asia Pac as macroeconomic conditions and covered lockdowns in China continued to weigh on consumer demand.

Our new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture had an exceptional launch.

 

The first ADA GPU, the GeForce RTX 4090 became available in mid-October and a tremendous amount and positive feedback from the gaming community.

We sold out quickly in many locations and are working hard to keep up with demand.

 

The next member of the ATA family, RTX 4080 is available today.

The RTX 40 Series GPUs features DLSS 3, the neuro rendering technology that uses AI to generate entire frames for faster game play.

 

Our third-generation RTX technology has raised the bar for computer graphics and help supercharge gaming.

For example, the 15-year old classic game portal, now reimagined with full ray tracing and DLSS 3 has made it on Steam's top 100 most wish-listed gains.

 

The total number of RTX games and applications now exceeds 350.

There is tremendous energy in the gaming community that we believe will continue to fuel strong fundamentals over the long term.

 

The number of simultaneous users on steam just hit a record of $30 million, surpassing the prior peak of $28 million in January.

Activision's Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 set a record for the franchise with more than $800 million in opening weekend sales.

 

topping the combined box office openings of movie blockbusters, TopGun Maverick and Dr.

Strains in the Multiverse of [Inaudible].

 

And this month's League of Legends World Championship in San Francisco sold out minutes with 18,000 esports fans packed the arena where the Golden State Warriors play.

We continue to expand the GeForce NOW cloud gaming service.

 

In Q3, we added over 85 games to the library, bringing the total to over 1,400.

We also launched GeForce now on the new gaming devices, including Logitech, Cloud handheld, cloud gaming Chromebooks and Razor 5G Edge.

 

Moving to Probi Revenue of $200 million was down 60% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with the current demand expectations.

These dynamics are expected to continue in Q4.

 

Despite near-term challenges, we believe our long-term opportunity remains intact, fueled by AI simulation, computationally intensive design and engineering workloads.

At GTC, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Services, our first software and infrastructure as a service offering, enabling artists, developers and enterprise teams to design, publish and operate metaverse applications from anywhere on any device.

 

Omniverse Cloud Services runs on Omniverse cloud computer, a computing system comprised of NVIDIA OBX for graphics and physics simulation.

NVIDIA HDX for AI workloads and the NVIDIA graphics delivery network, a global scale, distributed data center network for delivering low-latency metaverse graphics on the edge.

 

Leaders in some of the world's largest industries continue to adopt Omniverse.

Home improvement retailer, Lowe's is using it to help design, build and operate digital twins for their stores.

 

Charter Communications and advanced analytics company, heavy AI are creating Omniverse power digital twins to optimize Charter's wireless network.

In Deutsche Bahn, operator of German National Railway is using Omniverse to create digital twins of its rail network and train AI models to monitor the network, increasing safety and reliability.

 

Moving to automotive.

Revenue of $251 million, increased 14% sequentially and 86% from a year ago.

 

Growth was driven by an increase in AI automotive solutions as our customers drive or on-based production ramp, continue to scale.

Automotive has great momentum and is on its way to be our next multibillion-dollar platform.

 

Global cars unveiled the all-new flagship Volvo EX90 SUV powered by the NVIDIA Drive platform.

This is the first model to use Volvo's software-defined architecture with a centralized core computer containing both drive Orin and DRIVEXaviar, along with 30 sensors.

 

Other recently announced design wins and new model introductions include ton, auto, Neo, Polystar and [Inaudible].

At GTC, we also announced that NVIDIA Drive Super Chip, the successor to Orin in our automotive SoC road map, drive [Inaudible] delivers up to 2,000 tariff lots of performance and leverages technologies introduced in our Grace Hopper and ADA architectures.

 

It is capable of running both the automated drive and in-vehicle infotainment systems.

Simultaneously offering a LIFA performance while reducing cost and energy consumption.

 

Driver will be available for automakers 25 models with Geely owned automaker, Zika as the first announced customer.

Moving to the rest of the P&L.

 

GAAP gross margin was 53.6% and and non-GAAP gross margin was 56.1%.

Gross margins reflect $702 million in inventory charges largely related to lower data center demand in China, partially offset by a warranty benefit of approximately $70 million.

 

Year-on-year, GAAP operating expenses were up 31%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 30%, primarily due to higher compensation expenses related to headcount growth and salary increases and higher data center infrastructure expenses.

Sequentially, both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expense growth was in the single-digit percent, and we plan to keep it relatively flat at these levels over the coming quarters.

 

We returned $3.75 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends.

At the end of Q3, we had approximately $8.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 23.

 

Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.

We expect our data center revenue to reflect early production shipments of the A100, offset by continued softness in China.

 

In gaming, we expect to resume sequential growth with our revenue still below end demand as we continue to work through the channel inventory correction.

And in automotive, we expect the continued ramp of our Oren design wins.

 

All in, we expect modest sequential growth driven by automotive, gaming and data center.

Revenue is expected to be $6 billion, plus or minus 2%.

 

GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be $63.2 million and 66%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.

GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.56 billion.

 

Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion.

GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $40 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments.

 

GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.

Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million to $550 million.

 

Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.

In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community.

 

We'll be attending the Credit Suisse conference in Phoenix on November 30.

The rate Virtual Tech Conference on December 5 and and the JPMorgan Forum on January 5 in Las Vegas.

 

Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 are scheduled for Wednesday, February 22.

We will now open the call for questions.

 

Operator, could you please poll for questions?
Operator

[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.

 

Your line is now open.



Vivek Arya

Thanks for taking my question.

 

Colette, just wanted to clarify first, I think last quarter, you gave us a sell-through rate for your gaming business at about $2.5 billion a quarter.

I think you said China is somewhat weaker.

 

So I was hoping you could update us on what that sell-through rate is right now for gaming.

And then, Jen-Hsun, the question for you.

 

A lot of concerns about large hyperscalers cutting their spending and pointing to a slowdown.

So if, let's say, U.S.

 

cloud capex is flat or slightly down next year, do you think your business can still grow in the data center and why?



Colette Kress

Yes.

 

Thanks for the question.

Let me first start with the sell-through on our gaming business.

 

we had indicated, if you put two quarters together, we would see approximately $5 billion in normalized sell-through for our business.

Now, during the quarter, sell-through in Q3 three was relatively solid.

 

We've indicated that although China lockdowns continue to channel -- excuse me, challenge our overall China business.

It was still relatively solid.

 

Notebook sell-through was also quite solid.

And desktop, a bit softer, particularly in that China and Asia areas.

 

We expect though stronger end demand, though, as we enter into Q4, driven by the upcoming holidays, as well as the continuation of the ADA adoption.



Jen-Hsun Huang

Vivek, our data center business is indexed to two fundamental dynamics.

 

The first has to do with general purpose computing no longer scaling.

And so, acceleration is necessary to achieve the necessary level of cost efficiency scale and energy efficiency scale so that we can continue to increase workloads while saving money and saving power.

 

Accelerated computing is recognized generally as the path forward as general purpose computing slows.

The second dynamic is AI.

 

And we're seeing surging demand in some very important sectors of AIs in important breakthroughs in AI.

One is called deep recommender systems, which is quite essential now to the best content or item or product to recommend to somebody who's using a device that is like a selfie or interacting with a computer just using voice.

 

You need to really understand the nature, the context of the person making the request and make the appropriate recommendation to them.

The second has to do with large language models.

 

This is -- this started several years ago with the invention of the transformer, which led to Bert, which led to GP3, which led to a whole bunch of other models now associated with that.

We now have the ability to learn representations of languages of all kinds.

 

It could be human language.

It could be the language of biology.

 

It could be the language of chemistry.

And recently, I just saw a breakthrough called Jeans LM, we just one of the first example of learning the language of human genomes.

 

The third has to do with generative AI.

You know that the first 10 years, we've dedicated ourselves to perception AI.

 

But the goal of perception, of course, is to understand context.

But the ultimate goal of AI is to make a contribution to create something to generate product.

 

And this is now the beginning of the era of generative AI.

You probably see it all over the place, whether they're generating images or generating videos or generating text of all kinds and the ability to augment our performance to enhance our performance to make productivity enhanced to reduce cost and improve whatever we do with whatever we have to work with, productivity is really more important than ever.

 

And so, you could see that our company is indexed to two things, both of which are more important than ever, which is power efficiency, cost efficiency and then, of course, productivity.

And these things are more important than ever.

 

And my expectation is that we're seeing all the strong demand and surging demand for AI and for niche reasons.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of C.J.

 

Muse with Evercore.

Your line is now open.

 



C.J. Muse

Yeah, Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question.

 

You started to bundle on NVIDIA enterprise now with the H-100.

I'm curious if you can talk about how we should think about timing around software monetization?

 

And how we should kind of see this flow through the model, particularly with the focus on the AI enterprise and Omnivere side of things?



Jen-Hsun Huang

Yes.

 

Thanks, CJ.

We're making excellent progress in NVIDIA AI enterprise.

 

In fact, you saw probably that we made several announcements this quarter associated with clouds.

You know that NVIDIA has a rich ecosystem.

 

And over the years, our rich ecosystem and our software stack has been integrated into developers and start-ups of all kinds, but more so -- more than ever, we're at the tipping point of clouds, and that's fantastic.

Because if we could get NVIDIA's architecture and our full stack into every single cloud, we could reach more customers more quickly.

 

And this quarter, we announced several initiatives, one has several partnerships and collaborations, one that we announced today, which has to do with Microsoft and our partnership there.

It has everything to do with scaling up AI because we have so many start-ups clamoring for large installations of our GPU so that they could do large language model training and building their start-ups and scale out of AI to enterprise and all of the world's Internet service providers.

 

Every company we're talking to would like to have the agility and the scale, flexibility of clouds.

And so, over the last year or so, we've been working on moving all of our software stacks to the cloud are of our platform and software stacks to the cloud.

 

And so, today, we announced that Microsoft and ourselves are going to standardize on the NVIDIA stack, for a very large part of the work that we're doing together so that we could take a full stack out to the world's enterprise.

That's all software included.

 

We, a month ago, announced the same similar type of partnership with Oracle.

You also saw that rescale a leader in high-performance computing cloud has integrated NVIDIA AI into their stack.

 

[Inaudible] has been integrated into GCP.

And we announced recently Nemo, large language model and bionemo large language model to put NVIDIA software in the cloud.

 

And we also announced Omniverse is now available in the cloud.

The goal of all of this is to move the NVIDIA platform full stack off boarding the cloud so that we can engage customers much, much more quickly and customers could engage our software if they would like to use it in the cloud, it's per GPU instance hour if they would like to utilize our software on-prem, they could do it through software license.

 

And so, license and subscription.

And so, in both cases, we now have software available practically everywhere you would like to engage it.

 

The partners that we work with are super excited about it because MBDA's rich ecosystem is global, and this could bring both new consumption into their cloud for both them and ourselves, but also connect all of these new opportunities to the other APIs and other services that they offer.

And so, our software stack is making really great progress.

 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Credit Suisse.

 

Your line is now open.



Chris Caso

Yes.

 

Thank you.

Good evening.

 

I wonder if you could give some more color about the inventory charges you took in the quarter and then internal inventory in general.

In the documentation, you talked about that being a portion of inventory on hand plus some purchase obligations.

 

And you also spoke in your prepared remarks that some of this was due to China data centers.

So if you can clarify what was in those charges.

 

And then, in general, for your internal inventory.

Does that still need to be worked down?

 

And what are the implications if that needs to be worked down over the next couple of quarters?



Colette Kress

Thanks for the question, Chris.

 

So as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we booked an entry of $702 million for inventory reserves within the quarter.

Most of that, primarily, all of it is related to our data center business, just due to the change in expected demand looking forward for China.

 

So when we look at the data center products, a good portion of this was also the A100, which we wrote down.

Now, looking at our inventory that we have on hand and the inventory that has increased, a lot of that is just due to our upcoming architectures coming to market.

 

our ADA architecture, our hopper architecture and even more in terms of our networking business.

We have been building for those architectures to come to market and as such to say.

 

We are always looking at our inventory levels at the end of each quarter for our expected demand going forward.

But I think we've done a solid job that we used in this quarter just based on that expectation going forward.

 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

 

Your line is now open.



Timothy Arcuri

Thanks a lot.

 

Colette, can you -- I have a two-part question.

First, is there any effect of stockpiling in the data center guidance?

 

I ask because you now have the A800 that is sort of a modified version of the A100 with the lower data transfer rate.

So one could imagine that customers might be stocking that while they can still get it.

 

And I guess the second part of that is related to the inventory charge, can you just go into that a little bit more?

Because last quarter, it made sense that you took a charge because revenue was less than you thought, but revenue came in pretty much in line.

 

And it sounded like China was a net neutral.

So is the charge related to just working A100 inventory down faster?

 

Is that what the charges related to?



Colette Kress

Sure.

 

So let me talk about the first statement that you indicated.

Most of our data center business that we see is we're working with customers specifically on their needs to build out accelerated computing and AI.

 

It's just not a business in terms of where units are being held for that.

They're usually four very, very specific products and projects that we see.

 

So I'm going to answer no.

Nothing that we can see.

 

Your second question regarding the inventory provisions.

At the end of last quarter, we were beginning to see softness in China.

 

We've always been looking at our needs long term.

It's not a statement about the current quarter in inventory, as you can see.

 

It usually takes two or three quarters for us to build product for the future demand.

So that's always a case of the inventory that we are ordering.

 

So now looking at what we've seen in terms of continued lockdowns, continued economy challenges in China it was time for us to take a hard look of what do we think we'll need for data center going forward and not leg for write-downs.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.

 

Your line is now open.



Stacy Rasgon

Hi, guys.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

Colette, I had a question on the commentary you gave on the sequentials.

 

It kind of sounded like data center maybe had some China softness issues.

You said gaming resumed sequential growth.

 

But then you said sequential growth for the company driven by auto gaming and data center.

How can all three of those grow sequentially if the overall guidance is kind of flattish?

 

Are they all just like growing just a little bit?

Or is one of them actually down?

 

Like how do we think about the segments into Q4 given that commentary?



Colette Kress

Yes.

 

So your question is regarding the sequentials from Q3 to our guidance that we provided for Q4.

As we are seeing the numbers in terms of our guidance, you're correct, is only growing about $100 million.

 

And we've indicated that three of those platforms will likely grow just a little bit.

But our pro visualization business we think is going to be flattish and likely not growing as we're still working on correcting the channel inventory levels.

 

to get to the right amount.

It's very difficult to say which will have that increase.

 

But again, we are planning for all three of those different market platforms to grow just a little bit.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.

 

Your line is now open.



Mark Lipacis

Hi.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

Jen-Hsun, I think for you, you've articulated a vision for the data center we're a solution with an integrated solution set of a CPU, GPU and DPU is deployed for all workloads or most workloads, I think.

 

Could you just give us a sense of or talk about where is this vision in the penetration cycle?

And maybe talk about Grace Grace's importance for realizing that vision, what will Grace deliver versus an off-the-shelf x86 where -- do you have a sense of where Grace will get embraced first or the fastest within that vision?

 



Jen-Hsun Huang

Grace's data moving capability is off the charts.

 

Grace also is memory coherent to our GPU, which allows our GPU to expand its effective GPU memory, fast GPU memory by a factor of 10.

That's not possible without special capabilities that are designed between hopper and Grace and the architecture of Grace.

 

And so, it was designed.

Grace is designed for very large data processing at very high speeds.

 

Those applications are related to, for example, data processing is related for recommender systems, which operates on petabytes of live data at a time.

It's all hot.

 

It all needs to be fast, so that you can make a recommendation within milliseconds to hundreds of millions of people using our service.

It is also quite effective at AI training, machine learning.

 

And so, those kind of applications are really terrific.

We -- Grace, I think I've said before that we will have production samples in Q1, and we're still on track to do that.

 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P.

 

Morgan.

Your line is now open.

 



Harlan Sur

Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question.

 

Your data center networking business, I believe, is driving about $800 million per quarter in sales, very, very strong growth over the past few years.

Near term, as you guys pointed out, and the team is driving strong Nick and blue food attached to your own compute solutions like DGX and more partner announcements like VMware, but we also know that networking has pretty large exposure to general purpose cloud and hyperscale compute spending trends.

 

So what's the visibility and growth outlook for the networking business over the next few quarters?



Jen-Hsun Huang

Yes.

 

If I could take that.

First, thanks for your question.

 

Our networking, as you know, is heavily indexed to high-performance computing.

We're not -- we don't serve the vast majority of commodity networking.

 

All of our network solutions are very high end, and they're designed for data centers that move a lot of data.

Now, if you have a hyperscale data center these days, and you are deploying a large number of AI applications.

 

It is very likely that the network bandwidth that you provision has a substantial implication on the overall throughput of your data center.

So the small incremental investment they make in high-performance networking translates to billions of dollars of savings slightly in provisioning the service or billions of dollars more throughput, which increases their economics.

 

And so, these days, with disaggregated and I application, AI provisioning and data centers, high-performance networking is really quite fantastic and it pays for itself right away.

But that's where we are focused in high-performance networking and provisioning AI services in -- well, the AI applications that we focus on.

 

You might have noticed that NVIDIA and Microsoft are building one of the largest AI infrastructures in the world.

And it is completely powered by NVIDIA's InfiniBand 400 gigabits per second network.

 

And the reason for that is because that network pays for itself instantaneously.

The investment that you're going to put into the infrastructure is so significant that if you were to be dragged by slow networks, obviously, the efficiency of the overall infrastructure is not as high.

 

And so, in the places where we focus networking is really quite important.

It goes all the way back to when we first announced the acquisition of Mellanox.

 

I think at the time, they were doing about a few hundred million dollars a quarter, about $400 million a quarter.

And now we're doing what they used to do in the old days, in a year, practically coming up in a quarter.

 

And so, that kind of tells you about the growth of high-performance networking.

It is an indexed to overall enterprise and data center spend but it is highly indexed to AI adoption.

 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

 

Your line is now open.



Aaron Rakers

Thanks for taking the question.

 

I want to expand on the networking question a little bit further.

When we look at the Microsoft announcement today, we think about what Meda is doing on the AI footprint that they're deploying.

 

Jen-Hsun, can you help us understand like where your InfiniBand networking sits relative to like traditional data center switching?

And maybe kind of build on that, how you're positioning spectrum for in the market, does that compete against a broader set of opportunities in the Ethernet world for AI fabric networking?

 



Jen-Hsun Huang

Yes.

 

Thanks, Erin.

The math is like this.

 

If you're going to spend $20 billion on an infrastructure and the efficiency of that overall data center is improved by 10%.

The numbers are huge.

 

And when we do these large language models and recommender systems, the processing is done across the entire data center.

And so, we distribute the workload across multiple GPUs, multiple nodes and it runs for a very long time.

 

And so, the importance of the network can be overemphasized.

And so, the difference of 10% in overall improvement in efficiency, which is very to achieve.

 

The difference between NVIDIA's InfiniBand, the entire software stack with what we call Magnum IO, which allows us to do computing in the network itself.

A lot of software is running in the network itself, not just moving data around.

 

We call it in-network computing because a ton of software is done at the edge at the -- within the network itself.

We achieved significant differences in overall efficiency.

 

And so, if you're spending billions of dollars on the infrastructure, or even hundreds of millions of dollars of interest on the infrastructure.

The difference is really quite profound.

 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.

 

Your line is now open.



Ambrish Srivastava

Hi.

 

Thank you very much.

I actually had a couple of clarifications.

 

Colette, in the data center side, is it a fair assumption that compute was down Q-over-Q in the reported quarter because the quarter before, Mellanox or the networking business was up as it was called out.

And again, you said it grew quarter over quarter.

 

So is that a fair assumption?

And then, I had a clarification on the USG band.

 

Initially, it was supposed to be a $400 million, really going to what the government was trying to firewall.

Is the A800 -- I'm just trying to make sure I understand it.

 

Isn't that against the spirit of what the government is trying to do, i.e., firewall, high-performance compute?

Or is A800 going to a different set of customers?

 



Colette Kress

Thank you for the question.

 

So looking at our compute for the quarter is about flattish.

Yes, we're seeing also growth growth in terms of our networking, but you should look at our Q3 compute is about flatters with last quarter.

 



Jen-Hsun Huang

Ambrish, A800 hardware, the hardware of ensures that it always meets U.S.

 

government's clear test for export control.

And it cannot be customer reprogrammed or application reprogrammed to exceed it.

 

It is hardware limited.

It is in the hardware that determines 800s capabilities.

 

And so, it meets the clear test in letter and in spirit.

We raised the concern about the $400 million of A100s because we were uncertain about whether we could execute.

 

The introduction of A800 to our customers and through our supply chain in time.

The company did remarkable feeds to swarm this situation and make sure that our business was not affected and our customers were not affected.

 

But A800 hardware surely ensures that it always meets U.S.

government's clear tests for export control.

Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities.

 

Your line is now open.



William Stein

Thank you.

 

I'm hoping you can discuss the pace of 100 growth as we progress over the next year.

We've gotten a lot of questions as to whether the ramp in this product should look like a sort of traditional product cycle where there's quite a bit of pent-up demand for this significant improved performance product and that there's supply available as well.

 

So does this rollout sort of look relatively typical from that perspective?

Or should we expect a more perhaps delayed start of the growth trajectory where we see maybe substantially more growth in, let's say, second half of '23.

 



Jen-Hsun Huang

H-100 ramp is different than the A100 ramp in several ways.

 

The first is that the TCO, the cost benefits, the operational cost benefits because of the energy savings because every data center is now Power Limited.

And because of this incredible transformer engine that's designed for the latest AI models.

 

The performance over Ampere is so significant that I -- and because of the pent-up demand for hopper because of these new models that are that I spoke about earlier, deep recommender systems and large language models and generative AI models.

Customers are clamoring to ramp hopper as quickly as possible, and we are trying to do the same.

 

We are all hands on deck to help the cloud service providers stand up the supercomputers.

Remember, I is the only company in the world that produces and ships semi-custom supercomputers in high volume.

 

It's a miracle to ship one supercomputer every three years.

it's unheard of to ship supercomputers to every cloud service provider in a quarter.

 

And so, we're working hand with every one of them, and every one of them are racing to stand up hoppers.

We expect them to have hopper cloud services stood up in Q1.

 

And so, we are expecting to ship some volume, we're expecting to ship production in Q4, and then we're expecting to ship large volumes in Q1.

That's a faster transition than MPIR.

 

And so, it's because of the dynamics that I described.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.

 

Your line is now open.



Matt Ramsay

Yeah.

 

Thank you very much.

Good afternoon.

 

I guess, Colette, I heard in your script that you had talked about maybe a new way of commenting on or reporting hyperscaler revenue in your data center business.

And I wonder if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail about what you're thinking there and what sort of drove the decision?

 

And I guess the derivative of that, Jen-Hsun, how -- that decision to talk about the data center business to hyperscalers differently.

I mean, what does that mean for the business that is just a reflection of where demand is and you're going to break things out differently?

 

Or is something changing about the mix of I guess, internal properties versus vertical industry demand within the hyperscale customer base.



Colette Kress

Yes, Matt, thanks for the question.

 

Let me clarify a little bit in terms of what we believe we should be looking at when we go forward and discussing our data center business.

Our data center business is becoming larger and larger and our customers are complex.

 

And when we talk about hyperscale, we tend to talk about seven, eight different companies.

But the reality is there's a lot of very large companies that we could add to that discussion based on what they're purchasing.

 

Additionally, looking at the cloud, looking at our cloud purchases and what our customers are building for the cloud is an important area to focus on because this is really where our enterprise is where our researchers, where our higher education is also purchasing.

So we're trying to look for a better way to describe the color of what we're seeing in the cloud and also give you a better understanding of some of these large installments that we're seeing in the hyperscales.

 



Jen-Hsun Huang

Yes.

 

Let me double click on what Colette just said, which is absolutely right.

There are two major dynamics that's happening.

 

First, the adoption of NVIDIA in Internet service companies around the world, the number and the scale by which they're doing it has grown a lot.

Internet service companies.

 

And these are Internet service companies that offer services, but they're not public cloud computing companies.

The second factor has to do with cloud computing.

 

We are now at the tipping point of cloud computing.

Almost every enterprise in the world has both a cloud-first and a multi-cloud strategy.

 

It is exactly the reason why all of the announcements that we made this year -- this quarter, this last quarter since GTC about all the new platforms that are now available in the cloud.

a CSP, a hyperscaler is both -- are two things to us, therefore, a hyperscaler can be a sell to customer.

 

They are also a cell with partner on the public cloud side of their business.

Because of the richness of NVIDIA's ecosystem because we have so many Internet service customers and enterprise customers using NVIDIA's full stack.

 

The public cloud side of their business really enjoys and values the partnership with us and the cell with relationship they have with us.

And it's pretty clear now that for all of the hyperscalers, the public cloud side of their business will likely would very likely be the vast majority of their overall consumption.

 

And so, because the world CSPs, the world's public clouds is only at the early innings of their enterprise to lifting enterprise to the cloud world it's very, very clear that the public cloud side of the business is going to be very large.

And so, increasingly, our relationship with CSPs, our relationship with hyperscalers will -- will include, of course, continuing to sell to them for internal consumption but very importantly, sell with for the public cloud side.

Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.

 

Your line is now open.



Joseph Moore

Great.

 

Thank you.

I wonder if you could talk to looking backward at the crypto impact.

 

Obviously, that's gone from your numbers now, but do you see any potential for liquidation of GPUs that are in the mining network, any impact going forward?

And do you foresee blockchain being an important part of your business at some point down the road?

 



Jen-Hsun Huang

We don't expect to see blockchain being an important part of our business down the road.

 

There is always a resell market.

If you look at any of the major resell sites, eBay, for example, there are secondhand graphics cards for sale all the time.

 

And the reason for that is because a 3090 that somebody bought today, is upgraded to a 4090 or 3090 by a couple of years ago, it was up are until 4090 today.

That 3090 could be sold to somebody and enjoyed it sold at the right price.

 

And so, the volume of -- the availability of secondhand and used graphics cards has always been there.

And the inventory is never zero.

 

and when the inventory is larger than usual, like all supply demand, it would likely drift lower price and affect the lower ends of our market.

But my sense is that where we're going right now with ADA is targeting very clearly in the upper range, the top half of our market.

 

And and early signs are, and I'm sure you're also seeing that the ADA launch was a home run.

That we shipped a large volume of 4090s because as you know, we were prepared for it.

 

And yet within minutes, they were sold out around the world.

And so, the reception of 4090 and the reception of 4080 today has been off the charts.

 

And that says something about the strength and the health and the vibrancy of the gaming market.

So we're super enthusiastic about the ADA launch.

 

We have many more ad products to come.

Your last question today comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.

 

Your line is now open.



Toshiya Hari

Great.

 

Thank you so much for squeezing me in.

I had two quick ones for Colette.

 

On supply, I think there was some mixed messaging in your remarks.

I think you talked about supply being a headwind at one point.

 

And then, when you were speaking to the networking business, I think you talked about supply easing.

So I was hoping you can kind of speak to supply if you're caught up to demand at this point.

 

And then, secondly, just on stock-based compensation, pretty mundane topic I realize, but it is -- I think in the quarter, it was about $700 million.

It's becoming a bigger piece of your opex.

 

So curious how we should be modeling that going forward.



Colette Kress

Sure.

 

When we look at our supply constraints that we have had in the past, each and every quarter, this is getting better Networking was one of our issues probably a year ago, and it has taken us probably to this quarter.

and next quarter to really see our supply improved so that we can support the pipeline that we have for our customers that are -- now that's our supply.

 

We've also made a discussion regarding our customers, supply constraints, issues when setting up a data center, even getting data center capacity has been very difficult.

And therefore, that challenges them in their purchasing decisions as they're still looking for certain parts of that supply chain to come through.

 

So that hopefully clarifies what we were talking about regarding two areas of supply.

In our stock-based compensation, what we'll see, it's very difficult to predict what our stock-based compensation would be when it arrives.

 

We have provided to our incoming employees but also once a year to our employees, and it's a single date in terms of when that is priced.

So it's difficult to determine, but stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and will continue to be.

 

So we look at it from an overall compensation perspective.

So up until now and when we do the focal, we'll see about the same size with a few additions for the reduced level of employee hiring that we have right now.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

I will now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun Huang for closing remarks.



Jen-Hsun Huang

Thanks, everyone.

 

We are quickly adapting to the macro environment.

Correcting inventory levels, offering alternative products to data center customers in China and keeping our opex flat for the next few quarters.

 

Our new platforms are off to a great start and formed the foundation for our resumed growth.

MRTX is reinventing 3D graphics with ray tracing and AI.

 

The launch of [Inaudible] is phenomenal.

Gamers waited in long lines around the world, 4090 stocks sold out quickly.

 

Hopper, with its revolutionary transformer engine is just in time to meet the surging demand for recommender systems, large language models and generative AI.

NVIDIA networking is synonymous with the highest data center throughput and enjoying record results.

 

Oren is the world's first computing platform designed for AI-powered autonomous vehicles and robotics and putting automotive on the road to be our next multibillion-dollar platform.

These computing platforms run NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse, software libraries and engines that help the companies build and deploy AI to products and services.

 

we this pioneering work and accelerated computing is more vital than ever.

Limited by business, general purpose commuting has slowed to a crawl just as AI demands more computing.

 

Scaling through general purchase computing alone is no longer viable, both from a cost or power standpoint.

Accelerated computing is the path forward.

 

We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.

Satya Nadella

Thank you very much, Brett.

 

The Microsoft Cloud delivered over $28 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22% and 25% in constant currency, demonstrating our continued leadership across the tech stack.

We continue to focus on three priorities.

 

First, helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend.

Second, investing to lead in the new AI wave across our solution areas and expanding our TAM.

 

And third, driving operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth.

Now I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure.

 

Azure took share as customers continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric from cloud to edge, especially as every application becomes AI-powered.

We have the most powerful AI infrastructure and it’s being used by our partner, OpenAI, as well as NVIDIA and leading AI start-ups like Adept and Inflection to train large models.

 

Our Azure OpenAI Service brings together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 with the enterprise capabilities of Azure.

From Coursera and Grammarly to Mercedes-Benz and Shell, we now have more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI Service customers, up 10x quarter-over-quarter.

 

Just last week, Epic Systems shared that it was using Azure OpenAI Service to integrate the next generation of AI with its industry-leading EHR software.

Azure also powers OpenAI API and we are pleased to see brands like Shopify and Snap use the API to integrate OpenAI's models.

 

More broadly, we continue to see the world's largest enterprises migrate key workloads to our cloud.

Unilever, for example, went all in on Azure this quarter in one of the largest ever cloud migrations in the consumer goods industry.

 

IKEA Retail, ING Bank, Rabobank, Telstra and Wolverine Worldwide, all use Azure Arc to run Azure services across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud environments.

We now have more than 15,000 Azure Arc customers, up over 150% year-over-year.

 

And we are extending our infrastructure to 5G network edge with Azure for Operators.

We are the cloud of choice for telcos, and at MWC last month, AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, Singtel and Telefonica all shared how they are using our infrastructure to modernize and monetize their networks.

 

Now on to data.

Our Intelligent Data Platform brings together databases, analytics and governance, so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate.

 

Cosmos DB is the go-to database, powering the world's most demanding workloads at any scale.

OpenAI relies on Cosmos DB to dynamically scale their ChatGPT service, one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever, enabling high reliability and low maintenance.

 

The NBA uses Cosmos DB to ingest more than 10 million data points per game, helping teams optimize their gameplay.

And we are taking share with our analytics solutions.

 

Companies like BP, Canadian Tire, Marks & Spencer and T-Mobile all rely on our end-to-end analytics to improve speed to insight.

Now on to developers.

 

From Visual Studio to GitHub, we have the most popular tools to help every developer go from idea to code and code to cloud, all while staying in their flow.

Today, 76% of the Fortune 500 use GitHub to build, ship and maintain software.

 

And with GitHub Copilot, the first at-scale AI developer tool, we are fundamentally transforming the productivity of every developer from novices to experts.

In three months since we made Copilot for Business broadly available, over 10,000 organizations have signed up, including the likes of Coca-Cola and GM as well as Duolingo and Mercado Libre, all of which credit Copilot with increasing the speed for their developers.

 

We're also bringing next-generation AI to Power Platform so anyone can automate workflows, create apps or web pages, build virtual agents and analyze data using only natural language.

More than 36,000 organizations have already used existing AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform.

 

And with our new Copilot in Power Apps, we are extending these capabilities to end users who can interact with any app through conversation instead of clicks.

All up, we now have nearly 33 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up nearly 50% year-over-year.

 

Now on to business applications.

From customer experience and service to finance and supply chain, we continue to take share across all categories we serve as organizations like Asahi, C.H.

 

Robinson, E.ON, Franklin Templeton, choose our AI-powered business applications to automate, simulate and predict every business process and function.

And we are going further with Dynamics 365 Copilot, which works across CRM and ERP systems to bring the next generation of AI to employees in every job function, reducing burdensome tasks like manual data entry, content generation and notetaking.

 

Now on to our industry and cross-industry solutions.

Our Cloud for Sustainability is seeing strong adoption from companies in every industry, including BBC, Nissan and TCL as they deliver on their respective environmental commitments.

 

Our Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last week as we expanded our offerings for payors and added new AI-powered capabilities for providers.

We showcased the first fully AI-automated clinical documentation application, Nuance DAX Express, which will bring GPT-4 to more than 550,000 existing users of Dragon Medical.

 

And at Hannover Messe manufacturing trade show, Siemens shared how it will use a Teams app integrated with Azure OpenAI Service to optimize factory workflows.

Now on to future of work.

 

Microsoft 365 Copilot combines next-generation AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications, removing the drudgery and unleashing the creativity of work.

Copilot works alongside users embedded in the Microsoft 365 applications millions use every day, and it also powers Business Chat, which uses natural language to surface information and insights based on business content and context.

 

We've been encouraged by early feedback and look forward to bringing these experiences to more users in the coming months.

Teams usage is at an all-time high and surpassed 300 million monthly active users this quarter, and we once again took share across every category from collaboration to chat to meetings to calling as we add value for existing customers and win new ones like ABN AMRO, Jaguar Land Rover, Mattress Firm, Unisys and Vodafone.

 

We announced a new version of Teams that delivers up to 2 times faster performance while using 50% less memory so customers can collaborate more efficiently and prepare for experiences like Copilot.

Teams is also expanding our TAM.

 

Nearly 60% of our enterprise Teams customers buy Teams Phone, Rooms or Premium.

Teams Phone is the undisputed market leader in cloud calling, helping our customers reduce cost with a three year ROI of over 140%.

 

Teams Rooms revenue more than doubled year-over-year and Teams Premium meets enterprise demand for AI-powered features like intelligent recaps.

Now generally available, it's one of our fastest-growing Modern Work products ever with thousands of paid customers just two months in.

 

With Microsoft Viva, we have created a completely new suite for employee experience.

Viva brings together goals, communications, learning, workplace analytics and employee feedback.

 

Across industries, companies like Dell, Mastercard and SES are using Viva to help their employees thrive.

Just last week, we announced Copilot for Viva, offering leaders a new way to build high-performance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement.

 

And with Viva Sales, we have extended the platform to specific job functions, helping sellers apply large language models to their CRM and Microsoft 365 data so that they can automatically generate content like customer mails.

All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365, Ferrovial, Goldman Sachs, Novo Nordisk and Rogers all chose E5 to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps along with advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics.

 

Now on to Windows.

While the PC market continues to face headwinds, we again saw record monthly active Windows devices and higher usage compared to pre-pandemic.

 

We're also seeing accelerated growth in Windows 11 commercial deployments.

Over 90% of the Fortune 500 are currently trialing or have deployed Windows 11.

 

And with Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop, we continue to transform how our employees at companies like Mazda and Nationwide access Windows.

All up, over one-third of our enterprise customer base has purchased cloud-delivered Windows to-date.

 

And new Windows 365 Frontline extends the power and security of Cloud PCs to shift workers for the first time.

Now on to security.

 

Our comprehensive AI-powered solutions spanning all clouds and all platforms give the agility advantage back to defenders.

Among analysts, we are the leader in more categories than any other provider.

 

And we once again took share across all major categories we serve and we continue to introduce new products and functionality to further protect customers.

With Security Copilot, we are combining large language models with a domain-specific model informed by our threat intelligence and 65 trillion daily security signals to transform every aspect of the SOC productivity.

 

And we also added new governance controls and policy protections to better secure identities along with resources they access.

Nearly 720,000 organizations now use Azure Active Directory, up 33% year-over-year.

 

And all up, nearly 600,000 customers now have four or more security workloads, up 35% year-over-year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation.

EY and Qualcomm, for example, both chose our full security stack to ensure the highest levels of protection and visibility across their organizations.

 

Now on to LinkedIn.

We once again saw record engagement as more than 930 million members turn to the professional social network to connect, learn, sell and get hired.

 

Member growth accelerated for the seventh consecutive quarter as we expanded to new audiences.

We now have 100 million members in India, up 19%.

 

And as Gen Z enters the workforce, we saw 73% year-over-year increase in the number of student sign-ups.

In this persistently tight labor market, LinkedIn Talent Solutions continues to help hirers connect to job seekers and professionals to build the skills they need to access opportunity.

 

Our hiring business took share for the third consecutive quarter.

The excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function from marketing, sales and finance to software development and security.

 

LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn, discuss and up-level their skills with more than 100 AI courses.

And we have introduced new AI-powered features, including writing suggestions for member profiles and job descriptions and collaborative articles.

 

Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe, trusted platform.

More broadly, we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising.

 

Our exclusive partnership with Netflix brings differentiated premium video content to our ad network, and our new Copilot for the web is reshaping daily search and web habits.

Two months since the launch of new Bing and Edge, we are very encouraged by user feedback and usage patterns.

 

All up, Bing has more than 100 million daily active users.

We are winning new customers on Windows and mobile.

 

Daily installs of the Bing mobile app have grown 4 times since launch.

We are making progress in share gains.

 

Edge took share for the eighth consecutive quarter and Bing once again grew share in the United States.

We continue to innovate with first-of-their-kind AI-powered features, including the ability to set the tone of chat and create images from text prompts powered by DALL-E.

 

Over 200 million images have been created to date and we see that when people use these new AI features their engagement with Bing and Edge goes up.

As we look towards a future where chat becomes a new way for people to seek information, consumers have real choice in business model and modalities with Azure-powered chat entry points across Bing, Edge, Windows and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

 

We look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category, search.

Now on to gaming.

 

We are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice for people to play great games whenever, however and wherever they want.

We set third quarter records for monthly active users and monthly active devices.

 

Across our content & services business, we are delivering on our commitment to offer gamers more ways to experience the games they love.

Our revenue from subscriptions reached nearly $1 billion this quarter.

 

This quarter, we also brought PC Game Pass to 40 new countries, nearly doubling the number of markets we are available.

Great content remains the flywheel behind our growth.

 

We have now surpassed 500 million lifetime unique users across our first-party titles.

And I’ve never been more excited about our pipeline of games, including the fourth quarter launches of Minecraft Legends and Redfall.

 

In closing, we are focused on continuing to raise the bar on our operational excellence and performance as we innovate to help our customers maximize the value of their existing technology investments and thrive in the new era of AI.

In a few weeks times, we'll hold our Build conference, and we will share how we are building the most powerful AI platform for developers and I encourage you to tune in.

 

I could not be more energized about the opportunities ahead.

And with that, let me turn it over to Amy.

 



Amy Hood

Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone.

 

Our third quarter revenue was $52.9 billion, up 7% and 10% in constant currency.

Earnings per share was $2.45 and increased 10% and 14% in constant currency.

 

Our results exceeded expectations, driven by focused execution from our sales teams and partners.

In our commercial business, revenue was up 19% in constant currency.

 

We saw better-than-expected renewal strength, including across Microsoft 365, which also benefited Windows Commercial given the higher in-period revenue recognition.

In Office 365 stand-alone products, we saw improvement in new business growth, while growth trends in EMS and Windows Commercial standalone products remained consistent with Q2.

 

In Azure, customers continued to exercise some caution as optimization and new workload trends from the prior quarter continued as expected.

In our consumer business, PC demand was a bit better than we expected, particularly in the commercial segment, which benefited Windows OEM and Surface even as channel inventory levels remain elevated, which negatively impacted results.

 

Advertising spend landed in line with our expectations.

We have seen share gains in Azure, Dynamics, Teams, Security, Edge and Bing as we continue to focus on delivering high value as well as new innovative solutions to our customers, including next-generation AI capabilities.

 

Commercial bookings increased 11% and 12% in constant currency on a strong prior year comparable with a declining expiry base and 3 points of unfavorable impact from the inclusion of Nuance in the prior year.

The better-than-expected result was driven by strong execution across our renewal sales motions mentioned earlier.

 

Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 26% to $196 billion.

Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 18% year-over-year.

 

The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 34%.

And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 96%.

 

FX impact on total company revenue, segment level revenue and operating expense growth was as expected.

FX decreased COGS growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations.

 

Microsoft Cloud revenue was $28.5 billion and grew 22% and 25% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations.

Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 72%, a point ahead of expectations driven by cloud engineering efficiencies.

 

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by lower Azure margin.

Company gross margin dollars increased 9% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points due to the change in accounting estimate.

 

Gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 69%.

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by a lower mix of OEM revenue.

 

Operating expense increased 7% and 9% in constant currency, about $300 million lower than expected.

Operating expense growth was driven by roughly 2 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions as well as investments in cloud engineering and LinkedIn.

 

At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 9% higher than a year ago.

Operating income increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate.

 

Operating margins increased roughly 1 point year-over-year to 42%.

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins decreased slightly and increased slightly in constant currency.

 

Now to our segment results.

Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $17.5 billion and grew 11% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected results in Office commercial.

 

Office commercial revenue grew 13% and 17% in constant currency.

Office 365 commercial revenue increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with the strong renewal execution mentioned earlier and E5 momentum.

 

Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 11% year-over-year to over 382 million, with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments.

Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings.

 

Office commercial licensing declined 1% and increased 5% in constant currency, better than expected with 11 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan.

Office consumer revenue increased 1% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12% to 65.4 million.

 

LinkedIn revenue increased 8% and 10% in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions.

Dynamics revenue grew 17% and 21% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 25% and 29% in constant currency, with healthy growth across all workloads.

 

Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year.

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvements in Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to cloud offerings.

 

Operating expenses increased 4% and 5% in constant currency, and operating income increased 20% and 27% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate.

Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment.

Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 17% and 21% in constant currency.

 

Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 27% and 31% in constant currency.

In our per user business, enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 15% to nearly 250 million seats.

 

In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with continued demand for our hybrid offerings, including Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments, offset by transactional licensing.

Enterprise Services revenue grew 6% and 9% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across Enterprise Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services.

 

Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 18% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly.

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Azure margin noted earlier.

 

Operating expenses increased 19% and 20% in constant currency, including roughly 3 points of impact from the Nuance acquisition.

Operating income grew 13% and 17% in constant currency, with roughly 6 points from the change in accounting estimate.

 

Now to More Personal Computing.

Revenue was $13.3 billion, decreasing 9% and 7% in constant currency with better-than-expected results across all businesses.

 

Windows OEM revenue decreased 28% year-over-year and Devices revenue decreased 30% and 26% in constant currency, both ahead of expectations.

We saw better-than-expected PC demand, as noted earlier, particularly in the commercial segment, which has higher revenue per license, although results continue to be negatively impacted by elevated channel inventory levels.

 

Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, primarily due to the strong renewal execution with higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier.

Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 10% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points from the Xandr acquisition.

 

Results were driven by higher search volume with share gains again this quarter for our Edge browser globally and Bing in the U.S.

And in Gaming, revenue declined 4% and 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations.

 

Xbox hardware revenue declined 30% and 28% in constant currency on a high prior year comparable that benefited from increased console supply.

Xbox content and services revenue increased 3% and 5% in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected monetization in third-party and first-party content and growth in Xbox Game Pass.

 

Segment gross margin dollars declined 9% and 5% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year.

Operating expenses declined 5% and 3% in constant currency, even with 3 points of growth from the Xandr acquisition.

 

Operating income decreased 12% and 7% in constant currency.

Now back to total company results.

 

Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $7.8 billion to support cloud demand.

Cash paid for PP&E was $6.6 billion.

 

Cash flow from operations was $24.4 billion, down 4% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections as well as lower supplier payments were more than offset by a tax payment related to the R&D capitalization provisions and employee payments primarily related to headcount growth and an increase in employee compensation.

Free cash flow was $17.8 billion, down 11% year-over-year.

 

Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations increased 1% and free cash flow declined 5%.

This quarter, other income and expense was $321 million, higher than anticipated, driven by net gains on foreign currency remeasurement.

 

Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%.

And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

 

Now moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S.

dollar basis.

 

My commentary for the next quarter and FY '24 does not include any impact from Activision, which we continue to work towards closing in fiscal year 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals.

Now to FX.

 

Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 2 points with no impact to COGS or operating expense growth.

Within segments, we anticipate roughly 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and roughly 1 point in More Personal Computing.

 

Overall, our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q3 continue through Q4.

In our largest quarter of the year, we expect customer demand for our differentiated solutions, including our AI platform and consistent execution across the Microsoft Cloud to drive another quarter of healthy revenue growth.

 

Last year, we had our largest commercial bookings quarter ever with a material volume of large multiyear commitments.

On that comparable, we expect growth to be relatively flat.

 

We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions with strong renewals and continued commitment to our platform as we focus on meeting customers' changing contract needs, which include shorter term, quick time to value contracts in this dynamic environment.

Our key focus remains on delivering customer value.

 

Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 2 points year-over-year, driven by the accounting estimate change noted earlier.

Excluding that impact, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvements in Office 365 will offset the lower Azure margin and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand.

 

We expect capital expenditures to have a material sequential increase on a dollar basis, driven by investments in Azure AI infrastructure.

Reminder there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out.

 

Next, to segment guidance.

In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 12% in constant currency or $17.9 billion to $18.2 billion.

 

In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5.

We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency.

 

In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 30s.

In Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions.

 

For LinkedIn, we expect mid-single digit revenue growth driven by Talent Solutions with continued strong engagement on the platform.

And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high teens, driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365.

 

For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 15% and 16% in constant currency or $23.6 billion to $23.9 billion.

Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.

 

In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency, including roughly 1 point from AI services.

Growth continues to be driven by our Azure consumption business, and we expect the trends from Q3 to continue into Q4, as noted earlier.

 

Our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base.

In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions, including Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments, will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact.

 

And in Enterprise Services, revenue should be relatively unchanged year-over-year as growth in Enterprise Support Services will be offset by a decline in Microsoft Consulting Services.

In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $13.35 billion to $13.75 billion.

 

PC demand should be similar to Q3, and given channel inventory still remains elevated, our revenue will lag overall market growth as it continues to normalize.

Therefore, Windows OEM and Devices revenue should both decline in the low to mid-20s.

 

In Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue should decline low to mid-single digits.

While we expect healthy annuity billings growth driven by continued customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions, a reminder that our quarterly revenue growth can have variability, primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.

 

Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be approximately 10%, roughly 5 points higher than the overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by growth in first-party revenue is similar to Q3.

And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits.

 

We expect Xbox content services revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by third-party and first-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass.

Now back to company guidance.

 

We expect COGS to grow between 3% and 4% in constant currency or $16.8 billion to $17 billion and operating expense to grow approximately 2% in constant currency or $15.1 billion to $15.2 billion.

Other income and expense should be roughly $300 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense.

 

As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility.

We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be in line with our full year rate of approximately 19%.

 

And finally, as a reminder, for Q4 cash flow, we expect to make a $1.3 billion cash tax payment related to the R&D capitalization provision.

Now I'd like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year.

 

With our leadership position as we begin this AI era, we remain focused on strategically managing the company to deliver differentiated customer value as well as long-term financial growth and profitability.

As with any significant platform shift, it starts with innovation.

 

And we are excited about the early feedback and demand signals for the AI capabilities we have announced to date.

We will continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure, particularly AI-related spend as we scale with the growing demand, driven by customer transformation.

 

And we expect the resulting revenue to grow over time.

As always, we remain committed to aligning cost and revenue growth to deliver disciplined profitability.

 

Therefore, while the scaled CapEx investments will impact COGS growth, we expect FY '24 operating expense growth to remain low.

As a team, we have continually focused on pivoting our resources aggressively to the future as we execute at a high level in the moment to deliver value to our customers.

 

That balance has enabled the company to successfully lead across a number of platform shifts over a number of decades.

Therefore, we are committed to leading the AI platform wave and making the investments to support it.

 

With that, let's go to Q&A.

Brett?

 



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Amy.

 

We'll now move over to Q&A.

Out of respect for others in the call, we request that participants please only ask one question.

 

Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?
Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.

 

Please proceed.



Keith Weiss

Excellent.

 

Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on really a fantastic set of results in what we all know to be a still difficult environment out there.

I think it really illustrates Microsoft's advantages and a lot of these technology innovations that you guys have been talking about.

 

I wanted to ask you a question that I get probably more often than anything else and one that I frankly don't have a good answer to, and that's around the OpenAI partnership and particularly the accounting for that partnership.

So I was hoping you could give us a little bit of color about how -- whether or not revenue is flowing from OpenAI into Microsoft on the CapEx side of the equation, whether there's any impact.

 

Just give us a better understanding of how the comping around that relationship is working.



Amy Hood

Thanks, Keith.

 

In some ways, let me start by saying, it's a great partnership.

We're proud to have worked together for a number of years, leading to some of the announcements that you've heard us make more recently.

 

And we talked about the foundation of our partnership remains that when we both are successful, the other benefits.

When we grow, it helps them, and when they grow, it helps us.

 

But specifically to your question on how does it show up, it's easiest in this situation, to think about them as a customer of ours like any other customer who would use the Azure infrastructure and our Azure AI services in service of supporting their end customers.

And so when they do that, like any other customer who has a commercial relationship with us, we recognize revenue on that behalf.

 

That's probably the simplest frame, Keith, that I hope is helpful.



Keith Weiss

Yeah.

 

That’s super helpful.

I appreciate that.

 



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Keith.

 

Joe, next question, please.
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.

 

Please proceed.



Mark Moerdler

Congratulations on the quarter and the guidance and thanks for taking my question.

 

I'd like to drill into Azure and more specifically, Azure IaaS/PaaS consumption.

IaaS/PaaS consumption has really stepped down recently, and it's important to understand the macro versus macro and optimization that will rebound, whether it's going to rebound quickly or is there a more fundamental issue?

 

In other words, is it simply purely macro and everyone is stepping back a little bit and they're going to hit the pedal as soon as this comes back or is there something more fundamental that is driving corporate maybe to step back and that, that slowdown could sustain even when the IT spending rebounds.

Thank you.

 



Satya Nadella

Thanks, Mark for the question.

 

Maybe I'll make three comments.

And it's also important, I think to distinguish between what I'd say, macro or absolute performance and relative performance because I think that's perhaps a good way to think about how we manage our business.

 

First is optimizations do continue.

In fact, we are focused on it.

 

We incent our people to help our customers with optimization because we believe in the long run that the best way to secure the loyalty and long-term contracts with customers when they know that they can count on a cloud provider like us to help them continuously optimize their workload.

That's sort of the fundamental benefit of public cloud, and we are taking every opportunity to prove that out with customers in real time.

 

The second thing I'd say is, we do have new workloads started because if you think about it, during the pandemic, it was all about new workloads and scaling workloads.

But pre pandemic, there was a balance between optimizations and new workloads.

 

So what we're seeing now is the new workloads start in addition to highly intense optimization driven that we have.

The third is perhaps more of a relative statement because of some of the work we've done in AI even in the last couple of quarters, we are now seeing conversations we never had, whether it's coming through you and just OpenAI's API, right?

 

If you think about the consumer tech companies that are all spinning essentially Azure meters, because they have gone to open AI and are using their API.

These were not customers of Azure at all.

 

Second, even Azure OpenAI API customers are all new, and the workload conversations, whether it's B2C conversations in financial services or drug discovery on another side, these are all new workloads that we really were not in the game in the past, whereas we now are.

So those are the three comments that I'd make, both in terms of absolute macro, but more importantly, I think, what is our relative market position and how it's being changed.

 



Amy Hood

Mark, maybe the one thing I would add to those comments is, we've been through almost a year where that pivot that Satya talked about from we're starting tons of new workloads, and we'll call that the pandemic time, to this transition post, and we're coming to really the anniversary of that starting.

 

And so to talk to your point, we're continuing to set optimization.

But at some point, workloads just can't be optimized much further.

 

And when you start to anniversary that, you do see that it gets a little bit easier in terms of the comps year-over-year.

And so you even see that in a little bit of our guidance, some of that impact from a year-over-year basis.

 



Mark Moerdler

That was incredibly helpful.

 

I really do appreciate.

Thank you for the color and again, congratulations on what's happening.

 



Satya Nadella

Thanks, Mark.

 



Brett Iversen

Joe, next question, please.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.

 

Please proceed



Brent Thill

Thanks.

 

On Copilot monetization, can you just give us a sense of how much shows up, where we're going to see it?

And ultimately, is there a simple price lift that you think you can get through Copilot, say, 10%, 20%, 30% above where you saw the regular components of the Suite or is it too hard to factor in?

 

Thank you.



Satya Nadella

I mean, overall, we do plan to monetize a separate set of meters across all of the tech stack, whether they're consumption meters or per user subscriptions.

 

The Copilot that's priced and it is there is GitHub Copilot.

That's a good example of incrementally how we monetize the prices that are there out there and others are to be priced because they're in preview mode.

 

But you can expect us to do what we've done with GitHub Copilot pretty much across the board.



Amy Hood

Yeah, Brent.

 

The best way of thinking about this is when we believe we’re adding a lot of value.

And frankly, that’s what the Copilots are doing and some productivity improvement, you can expect that we will have this price for those and you’ll be able to look at that as we get to release, and to Satya’s point, GitHub Copilot is a great example.

 



Brent Thill

Thanks.

 



Brett Iversen

Joe, next question, please.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.

 

Please proceed



Raimo Lenschow

Thank you.

 

Congrats from me as well.

Just staying on the AI theme and more thinking about the gross margin impact on Azure.

 

Can you just, Satya, can you maybe a little - talk a little bit about like how you see the cost of compute for AI workloads versus kind of the classic workloads and how do you think that will evolve over time?

Thank you.

 



Satya Nadella

Yes, a couple of them.

 

One is clearly the accelerated compute is what gets used to drive AI.

And the thing that we are very, very focused on is to make sure that we get it very efficient in the usage of those resources.

 

If you think about sort of what the hyperscaler does, it's not just rack and stack sort of hardware.

They use software to optimize the performance of a given workload and, in fact, heterogeneous workloads on a given set of hardware.

 

And so we have many knobs that we’ll continuously continue to drive optimization across it.

And you see it even in the -- even for a given generation of a large model, where we started them to the cost footprint to where we end in the cost footprint even in a period of a quarter changes.

 

So you can expect us to do what we have done over the decade plus with the public cloud to bring the benefits of, I would say, continuous optimization of our COGS to a diverse set of workloads.

The other thing I'd mention is that there are a lot of workloads now.

 

Like one of the reasons why we got together with OpenAI primarily was we came out and said, this type of workload, whether it's a training or an inference workload is going to be much more generally relevant for us, not just in the context of AI.

And so you can see us apply it in other context as well.

 



Amy Hood

And Raimo, we talked a bit about this when we talked about the new Edge and the new Bing with analysts.

 

And I think one of the important things to keep in mind, which Satya is pointing to is that it's not really just the cost of Azure and the ability to optimize across the Azure workloads.

It's that really even our first-party workloads and apps that are built, right, are built on the same platform, and we're able because we are a hyperscaler and because we have a large commercial cloud first-party as well as consumer apps like Bing that are first party, we're able to take advantage of that and GPU utilization, AI services utilization across the stack.

 

And so it's not just sort of where Satya wanted to see even a broader benefit of being a hyperscaler.



Raimo Lenschow

Thank you.

 



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Raimo.

 

Joe, next question please.
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO.

 

Please proceed



Keith Bachman

Good afternoon.

 

Good evening.

Thank you for taking the question.

 

I want to address this up to you, if I could.

On your prepared remarks, you commented that you thought that operating expense growth would be lower.

 

I was hoping to just maybe flesh that out with some broader comments.

Could you talk about how you see any kind of directional color on how you see gross margins evolving, given mix and particularly supporting generative AI and/or any other comments that might help shape our thinking as we begin to look at the operating margin for the next fiscal year?

 

Thank you.



Amy Hood

Thanks, Keith.

 

It's probably a good opportunity to explain a bit about how I think about where we are, which is -- if you look at all of the businesses we're in and we look about our competitiveness in those businesses.

And this is before Satya started to comment a bit about our relative performance versus absolute.

 

And I'll tell you that the energy and focus we put right now is on relative performance and share gains.

Right now, we have the largest commercial cloud with increasing commitments by customers, with new workloads, new TAM opportunities that something you're talking about with customers.

 

And our focus is going to be and will be on continuing to take a growing share of that while we continue to focus on our customers' success in getting a ton of value out of what we are selling, whether that's the E5 product, the Microsoft 365, whether that's Windows 365 to help, maybe it's on compute costs and PC cost, whether it's working across the Azure stack.

And so with that opportunity plus in our consumer business, the largest number of active devices we've had in Windows, are still being used more being able to focus on edge share and being share and gaming -- bringing it to the PC as well across to mobile, these are the opportunities that we focus on as we think about next year.

 

And so if we feel like and I do, that we are well positioned to continue to take share in so many key places, then I say, great, and we want to be able to focus on investing in AI, which I talked about, will increase COGS growth, but we're committed to making sure we have healthy profitability by keeping operating expenses low.

And so what really this past year has been about, but really what Q3 starts to show is our willingness to pivot to the future to make sure we can keep all those commitments that Satya listed.

 

So while I know that's not giving specificity, it is, in fact, how we think about long-term success, in being well positioned in big markets, taking share in those markets, committing to make sure we're going to lead this wave, staying focused on gross margin improvements where we can.

Some of them will come in AI over time, given our commitment to the build-out.

 

We will charge for those AI capabilities and then ultimately will deliver operating profit.



Satya Nadella

Yeah.

 

I mean, just to add to it, during these periods of transition, the way I think as shareholders, you may want to look at is what's the opportunity set ahead.

We have a differentiated play to go after that opportunity set, which we believe we have.

 

Both the opportunity set in terms of TAM is bigger, and our differentiation at the very start of a cycle, we feel we have a good lead and we have differentiated offerings up and down the stack.

And so therefore, that's the sort of approach we're going to take, which is how do we maximize the return of that starting position for you all as shareholders long term.

 

That's sort of where we look at it.

And we'll manage the P&L carefully driving operating leverage in a disciplined way but not being shy of investing where we need to invest in order to grab the long-term opportunity.

 

And so obviously, we will see share gains first, usage first, then GM, then OPInc, right, like a classic P&L flow.

But we feel good about our position.

 



Keith Bachman

All right.

 

Many thanks for the answer.



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Keith.

 

Joe, next question, please.
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.

 

Please proceed



Karl Keirstead

Thanks.

 

We've had a lot of questions on AI and Azure, so maybe just to round it out.

Just on the Office 365 business, Amy.

 

16% constant currency guide for June, not really seeing much seat degradation despite obviously a tight labor market, so it's proven to be very resilient.

Could you just unpack the sensitivity to that headcount reduction, given that across your customer base, at least slower rate of hiring, just given that this is an enormous seat-based business?

 

It doesn't seem to be showing up.

Maybe you could just help us understand what's driving that continued seat growth and how durable that is?

 



Amy Hood

Thanks, Karl.

 

I think I would step back and say we have seen, I mean, the Office 365 suite but broadly, the Microsoft 365 suite adds a ton of value for users.

And so if you think about the users and on the global base, we've been able to add users, which you continue to see.

 

We still have in the frontline scenario at an SMB opportunity to continue to grow.

And in the enterprise, where we are a basic productivity tool, the labor market is still tight in most places, and we continue to see customers committed to the value they're getting.

 

And so I -- this is not something that -- I think our focus has really been on continuing to get healthy renewals, continue to add new products at renewal where it makes sense to save customers money and increase value.

And so I think that's the story of the resilience you're seeing.

 

And of course, we did have a good E5 quarter, which you're starting to see and it helps on ARPU.



Brett Iversen

Joe, next question, please.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC.

 

Please proceed



Rishi Jaluria

Hi, Satya.

 

Hi, Ami.

Thanks so much for taking my question.

 

Nice to see continued resilience in the business.

I wanted to get back to the topic of AI but I think maybe a little bit longer term.

 

What -- how are you thinking about the potential for regulation around AI, some of the concerns around data and customer privacy and governance?

And what do you think you can do to maybe quell some of those fears that governments and customers and organizations have around that?

 

Thanks.



Satya Nadella

Yeah.

 

Thanks, Rishi for the question.

So overall, we've taken the approach that we are not waiting for regulation to show up.

 

We are taking an approach where the unintended consequences of any new technology is something that from day 1, we think, about as first class and build into our engineering process all the safeguards.

So for example, in 2016 is when we put out the AI principles, we translated the AR principles into a set of internal standards that then are further translated into an implementation process that then we hold ourselves to internal audit essentially.

 

So that's the framework we have.

We have a Chief AI Officer who is sort of responsible for both thinking of what the standards are and then the people who even help us internally audit our following of the process.

 

And so we feel very, very good in terms of us being able to create trust in the systems we put out there.

And so we will obviously engage with any regulation that comes up in any jurisdiction.

 

But quite honestly, we think that the more there is any form of trust as a differentiated position in AI, I think we stand to gain from that.



Rishi Jaluria

All right.

 

Wonderful.

Thank you so much.

 



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Rishi.

 

Joe, we have time for one last question.
Operator

And our last question will come from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.

 

Please proceed



Michael Turrin

Hey.

 

Great.

Thanks.

 

Appreciate you squeezing me in.

I want to ask a question on the consolidation play that Microsoft is positioning for giving.

 

That's something we hear clearly top of mind for IT decision-makers currently.

You have clear plays there across security infrastructure apps and other areas.

 

So it would just be great to hear your view on the Microsoft consolidation playbook in the current environment, and if there are certain areas you're particularly focused on or seeing more traction around.

Thank you.

 



Satya Nadella

Yeah.

 

I mean, I'll start and Amy, you can add.

I think Amy referenced to even in the context of Microsoft 365 and Office 365.

 

But fundamentally, what we are focused on is making sure that the customers are able to derive the value out of our offerings, right, whether it's the Microsoft 365 suite value, which is significant, whether it's E3 or E5.

And we want to make sure that our -- they're getting deployed, they're getting used and that's obviously going to lead to our share gains in many cases.

 

Same thing in security.

That's a place where this quarter, you saw some good results from us.

 

And same on up and down the stack across Azure, right?

So when you think about AI, the anatomy of an AI application is not just an AI model.

 

In fact, ChatGPT itself is a great example.

ChatGPT, for example, uses Cosmos DB as their core database.

 

And so therefore, we want to make sure that our services, as they are competitive, get used together, whether it's the IaaS layer, the PaaS layer or the SaaS layer.



Amy Hood

And maybe one thing I would add, Michael, is that I know the question is consolidation, but another aspect of that is that some of the new business process automation work that's going to get done, whether that's the Dynamics workload that we've talked about, it also will benefit from having the AI services available on Azure, from having the core Azure capabilities as well as actually some front-end stuff that people are buying in Microsoft 365 to close these loops in a new way.

 

And so I think maybe it's not the traditional definition of consolidation.

But when people look and say, what vendor adds a lot of value and has the tools that we need and, in many instances, already own to be able to do this business process work, I think we have a great value and, frankly, probably leading tools in almost every vertical.

 



Michael Turrin

Great.

 

Thank you.

Albert Bourla

Thank you, Francesca.

 

Hello, everyone.

And thank you for joining us today.

 

Pfizer continues to have a far-reaching and positive impact on human health.

Through the first nine months of the year, more than 457 million patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines.

 

Compared with the first nine months of 2022, we have reached more patients in several key therapeutic areas, including oncology, cardiovascular disease and anti-infectives.

Patients will always be our North Star, and these figures serve as a testament to our leadership in innovation and our commitment to understanding and serving patients' needs.

 

During the third quarter, we were encouraged by the continued strong performance of Pfizer's non-COVID products, with revenue from these products growing 10% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter.

We saw significant contributions from new launches and robust year-over-year growth for several key in-line brands.

 

Our recently launched respiratory syncytial virus, the RSV, vaccine – it's called ABRYSVO – contributed $375 million in US revenues.

With the recent approval of the maternal indication, Pfizer is the only company with an RSV vaccine approved for preventing RSV in older adults and in infants via maternal immunization.

 

We believe ABRYSVO will be a significant and growing contributor to revenue as many customers have indicated to us that protecting both populations with one vaccine is desirable and a competitive advantage for ABRYSVO.

In the US alone, there are approximately 80 million adults over age 60 who are eligible for RSV vaccination, and an estimated 1.5 million pregnant women are eligible for maternal immunization with our RSV vaccine between September 2023 and January 2024.

 

Nurtec, Vydura and Oxbryta, which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2022, contributed $233 million and $85 million in global revenues, respectively.

For Nurtec, in the US, oral CGRPs represent about 17% of the migraine market, and the unmet need is high.

 

We believe oral CGRPs can ultimately be the first-line therapy for migraine and could eventually account for as much as 40% of the overall migraine market.

Primary care is a clear source of potential growth in the migraine marketplace.

 

Year to date, primary care healthcare providers wrote more than 6.1 million prescriptions for Triptans compared with approximately 1 million for oral CGRPs, which highlights a significant potential opportunity for growth.

Regarding Oxbryta, there is significant burden of illness and unmet need for patients suffering from sickle cell disease.

 

An estimated 12 million people around the world have SCD, sickle cell disease, with the highest prevalence in countries with the lowest resources.

While in the US, 95% of children survive to adulthood, 99% of children in other regions will die before they reach their 5th birthday, many without ever being diagnosed.

 

Our Vyndaqel family of products, including Vyndaqel, Vyndamax and Vynmac, recorded 47% operational growth globally compared with the third quarter of 2022.

This growth was driven largely by continued strong uptake of the transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy indication, primarily in the US and developed Europe.

 

We estimate there are between 120,000 and 150,000 people suffering from ATTR cardiomyopathy, with the majority still not yet diagnosed.

The largest unmet need continues to be the lack of general understanding and ability to diagnose this deadly disease, which is why we are focused on educational activities to expedite diagnosis and get appropriate patients on to treatment with the product as the proven standard of care.

 

Such efforts significantly contributed to this quarter's revenue increase in the US.

And our Prevnar family of products, Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20, saw global revenue rise 15% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter.

 

This increase was driven primarily by strong patient demand for Prevnar 20 Adult in the US, the US approval of Prevnar 20 Pediatric and associated stocking, and growth of Prevenar 13 Pediatric in certain emerging markets.

These were partially offset by anticipated lower market share in the US for Prevnar Pediatric due to competitive entry.

 

Of note, Prevnar 20 Adult remains the category-leading pneumococcal vaccine for adults in the US with a 95% market share in the third quarter.

Year-to-date, revenues for our non-COVID products have grown 7% operationally, and we remain on track to deliver 6% to 8% operational revenue growth for these products for the full year.

 

We continue to progress toward our goal of executing an unprecedented number of launches of new products or indications.

Recent milestones include US and EU approvals and launch of ABRYSVO in pregnant individuals; US approval and launch of Elrexfio in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma; US approval of our Braftovi+Mektovi combination in BRAF-mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer; US approval of VELSIPITY for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis; EC approval of Litfulo for severe alopecia areata; and US approval of PENBRAYA, the first and only pentavalent vaccine that provides coverage against the five most common serogroups causing meningococcal disease in adolescents and young adults 10 through 25 years of age.

 

To date, we have now executed 13 of the 19 originally identified potential launches, with four other products approved and preparations being made for their launch.

In fact, five of the six remaining potential launches have been largely de-risked from a technical perspective.

 

The only one remaining would be our mRNA flu candidate.

Given our recent positive results from our next-generation mRNA flu/COVID combination candidate and pending results for our 65-and-older first-generation Phase 3 standalone mRNA flu study, timing for our standalone mRNA flu is now expected after 2024.

 

If successful, our next-generation mRNA flu/COVID combination candidate is expected to market in 2025.

Mikael will share more about these programs shortly.

 

We remain excited about our proposed acquisition of Seagen and the dramatic impact we think this combination can have on human health.

One in three people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime.

 

So, conquering cancer would have an almost unimaginable impact on humanity.

We recently gained unconditional antitrust clearance from the EC, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance by the US FTC.

 

We have raised $31 billion in acquisition financing so far and continue to expect incremental 2030 risk-adjusted revenues in excess of $10 billion and expected cost efficiencies of $1 billion to be realized by the end of year three post-closing without impacting any R&D programs.

With that, I will turn it over to Dave.

 

After Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline.

So Dave?

 



Dave Denton 

Thank you, Albert.

 

And good morning.

Before I review this quarter's results, I will address a couple of topics that have been top of mind with investors since our announcement on October 13th.

 

These topics relate to our future US government Paxlovid revenue forecasts, as well as our multi-year cost realignment program.

With respect to revenue recognition associated with the amended agreement, the US government is expected to return an estimated 7.9 million EUA-labeled treatment courses and, in return, will receive a volume-based credit at an approximate value of $4.2 billion at the end of 2023 for future treatment courses.

 

Pfizer will also provide an additional 1 million treatment courses into the US strategic national stockpile.

As a result of all that, Pfizer has an obligation to deliver an estimated 8.9 million treatment courses for which we will record approximately $4.2 billion of revenue beginning in 2024 as we deliver treatment courses.

 

It is important to note that there is no cash compensation for the estimated 8.9 million treatment courses delivered.

Regarding our cost realignment program, I want to reiterate that we expect to achieve at least $3.5 billion of net cost savings by the end of 2024 versus the mid-point of our August 1, 2023 SI&A and R&D guidance.

 

We expect $1 billion of targeted savings in 2023 and expect an additional savings of at least $2.5 billion in 2024.

In a moment, when I review the components of our full-year 2023 guidance, you will see that we have lowered the midpoints of both our SI&A and R&D guidance ranges by $500 million, respectively.

 

Now, turning to the quarter, our Q3 results, both top and bottom line, were significantly and negatively impacted by our COVID products.

Revenues declined 41% operationally, the result of the decrease in both Paxlovid and Comirnaty sales, while adjusted diluted loss per share was also significantly impacted by $5.6 billion of non-cash inventory write-offs of COVID related inventories.

 

I want to emphasize, as Albert stated previously, that the operational revenue growth of our products in Q3, excluding both Paxlovid and Comirnaty were strong at 10%.

Contributing to this strong performance was our newly approved RSV vaccine and the families of products associated with both Prevnar and Vyndaqel.

 

Additionally, our recently acquired products, Nurtec and Oxbryta, also contributed to this strong growth.

Our reported diluted loss per share of $0.42 and adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.17 in the quarter are primarily the result of the decline in Paxlovid and Comirnaty sales and the non-cash charge related to write-offs of COVID-related inventories.

 

The inventory write-off of $4.7 billion for Paxlovid and $900 million for Comirnaty negatively affected adjusted loss per share by $0.84.

Foreign exchange movements had a de minimis unfavorable impact on third quarter revenues and increased adjusted diluted loss per share by $0.04 or 2% compared to LY.

 

Now, let me briefly touch on our full-year guidance.

Given we updated our full-year revenue and EPS guidance on October 13th, I am just going to hit a few of the highlights.

 

Total company full-year 2023 revenues are expected to be in the range of $58 billion to $61 billion versus previous range of $67 billion to $70 billion.

Importantly, we continue to expect 6% to 8% full- year operational revenue growth for non-COVID products year-over-year.

 

As anticipated, the majority of this growth is occurring in the second half of the year, given the timing of new product and indicated launches.

I want to remind you that, beginning in Q4, we will overlap the acquisitions of Biohaven and GBT last year, which we completed on October of 2022.

 

Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be in the range of 41% to 43%, primarily the result of the $5.6 billion non-cash charge related to inventory write-offs for our COVID products.

Adjusted SI&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $13.3 billion to $14.3 billion, and adjusted R&D expenses to be within a range of $11.9 billion to $12.9 billion.

 

The mid-points of both ranges are now $500 million lower than our original guidance.

As a result of all these, the company now expects full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.65 versus the original guidance range of $3.25 to $3.45.

 

All additional components of our guidance are included in our press release that was issued earlier today.

As discussed in prior quarters, our capital strategy is based on three core pillars.

 

First is reinvesting in our business.

Second is growing our dividends over time.

 

And third is making value-enhancing share repurchases.

In the first nine months of 2023, we invested $7.9 billion in internal R&D, returned $6.9 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, and allocated approximately $43 billion towards the proposed Seagen acquisition.

 

Lastly, in addition to our completing a $31 billion unsecured debt offering in Q2 of this year, we are ready to execute the remaining short-term financing to complete the proposed Seagen acquisition upon fulfillment of the required closing conditions.

We expect to de-lever our capital structure following the completion of this transaction, and as we de-lever, we anticipate returning to a more balanced capital allocation strategy, inclusive of share repurchases.

 

In closing, I want to reiterate that our product portfolio remains very strong.

We continue to be encouraged by the momentum of our non-COVID products in Q3 and are committed to the successful execution of our new product and indication launches.

 

We expect that the cost realignment program will improve our operating margins, enhancing long-term shareholder value.

And with that, let me turn it over to Mikael.

 



Mikael Dolsten 

Thank you, Dave.

 

Today, I will share important updates from our robust respiratory vaccine portfolio.

Our respiratory vaccines are built upon three cutting-edge platforms that enable us to bring the right science to the right pathogen.

 

These include our mRNA platform in partnership with BioNTech targeting highly variant viruses, our subunit platform targeting viruses that remain relatively consistent season to season, and our conjugate vaccine platform designed to help prevent bacterial infections.

We have achieved FDA approvals of vaccines derived from each platform within the last year and aim to further expand our leadership with additional vaccine candidates in development.

 

Today, I will provide information on our standalone flu vaccine candidate, flu-COVID combination vaccine candidates and next gen pneumococcal vaccine candidate.

We are pleased to announce that we achieved both primary endpoints in the 18 to 64-year-old cohort of our ongoing Phase 3 flu trial.

 

In the trial, our first-gen mRNA flu vaccine candidate demonstrated non-inferiority and superiority to a licensed flu vaccine at the time of the primary analysis.

This represents the first and only demonstration of efficacy and superiority for an mRNA-based flu vaccine candidate.

 

In this age cohort, efficacy was maintained through the trial's end of season analysis, with our candidate remaining non-inferior to the licensed comparator.

Safety was similar to standard flu vaccine.

 

The primary and end of season efficacy analyses considered both influenza A and B cases collectively.

The vast majority of cases recorded in our trial, and during the 2022/2023 flu season overall, were flu A cases.

 

Immunogenicity data showed robust antibody responses against influenza A compared to licensed flu vaccine.

Humoral responses against influenza B were lower than those achieved with the comparator.

 

Recall that our standalone flu vaccine Phase 3 study also includes a 65 and older cohort that we previously shared encouraging T cell data for all four strains from the Phase 2 study in this cohort.

Our belief is that the ability of the vaccine candidate to induce T cell responses may contribute to the improved efficacy over current seasonal flu vaccines, particularly in those 65 and older.

 

We expect a readout from this age group later this year.

To address the lower B responses seen with our first-gen standalone flu candidate, Pfizer created next-generation reformulations.

 

These were incorporated into our mRNA flu candidates in combination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which I will review now.

In positive Phase 1/2 topline data announced last week, we observed that reformulation of the lead flu candidates resulted in improved immunogenicity against influenza B, allowing us to meet all criteria for advancement to Phase 3.

 

In the trial, our lead candidate formulations induced robust immune responses, with point estimates for Geometric Mean Titer ratios that were consistent with criteria applied to approved vaccines for all matched flu and SARS-CoV-2 strains.

Notably, point estimates for Geometric Mean Titer ratios with selected candidate formulations were greater than one relative to the licensed comparator for all matched flu vaccine strains.

 

The safety profiles of evaluated candidates were consistent with Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine.

Following these positive immunogenicity data, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in the coming months.

 

Successfully developing a broad seasonal vaccine franchise anchored around a modFlu mRNA vaccine is a key priority, as it may allow us to tap into the nearly 50% annual flu vaccination rate in US adults.

We are taking a differentiated approach in pursuit of this goal, leveraging both mRNA and protein subunit technologies.

 

Our development program includes double and triple combination vaccines to potentially help protect against flu, COVID-19, and RSV.

Now, turning to PREVNAR, I'll start by reminding you that this is the only PCV business with an FDA indication for pneumonia in adults.

 

Providing protection specifically against pneumococcal pneumonia is critical.

It's the most common form of pneumococcal disease in adults, leading to 150,000 US hospitalizations each year.

 

The prevalence of nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia is more than 15-fold greater than that of invasive pneumococcal disease in US adults 50 and older.

PREVNAR's pneumonia indication is supported by the CAPiTA trial, which was enabled by a pneumococcal vaccine-naïve population and proprietary assay.

 

These innovative characteristics make it challenging for others to conduct a similar study, given the high level of pneumococcal vaccine coverage that exists today.

CAPiTA's innovative design and landmark results helped establish our leading and differentiated position in the PCV space.

 

To solidify this position, we are committed to pursuing continued innovation.

Our goal is to potentially maximize valency and improve immunogenicity while maintaining coverage of the serotypes clinically demonstrated to protect against pneumonia.

 

In line with this commitment, we have been developing a fourth-generation PCV candidate that builds on the PREVNAR business' 20-year-plus of innovation.

Our next-generation technology leverages cutting-edge conjugation chemistry, carriers, and reformulations.

 

Using these new proprietary vaccine technologies, we observed a several fold improvement in select serotype immunogenicity in a monovalent Phase 1 study.

Based on these data, we are confident that when we move this technology into our multivalent 4th generation candidate, we have the potential to achieve increased valency with improved serotype immunogenicity.

 

We are now advancing our fourth-generation candidate into a first-in-human trial, which is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Finally, I will leave you with our list of milestones and call out the recent approvals of VELSIPITY for ulcerative colitis and PENBRAYA, the first pentavalent meningococcal vaccine.

 

Pfizer has delivered more than a dozen regulatory approvals this year alone.

I'll also note the recent launches of ABRYSVO for maternal immunization and ELREXFIO in multiple myeloma.

 

Thank you.

Let me turn it over to Francesca to start the Q&A session.

 

Francesca DeMartino Thanks, Michael.

With that, let's start the Q&A session.

 

We will answer as many questions as time permits.

And I will be available after the call to answer any follow-up questions.

 

Operator, please assemble the queue.
Operator

[Operator Instructions].

 

Our first question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.



Robyn Karnauskas

I think I have a big picture question on your new launches, which is extremely important for your growth.

 

Are you seeing any impact given, I think, vaccine fatigue that we've seen with COVID impacting RSV and pneumococcal vaccines?

And how do you think about that impact as you think about 2023 and 2024?

 

Do you think that will dissipate?



Albert Bourla

First of all, I think it's good when you have a portfolio.

 

And we have a quite strong portfolio because we have RSV, we have COVID and we have pneumococcal in the respiratory front.

But I think the biggest impact will be when and if we have combination products.

 

We think that combination products will – because of their convenience, because of vaccines are preferred by payers with zero copay will increase basically the volumes and vaccination rates of all vaccines because of the convenience of one injection.

And I think this is why you saw from Mikael all our efforts right now are in developing multiple combinations, so that consumers and physicians will have choice which ones to administer, always with the same convenience.

 
Operator

Our next question will come from Huynh Trung with UBS.

 



Trung Huynh

I have one on flu and then just one on danu.

 

So on flu, can you confirm the comparator in the 18 to 64 and also the 64 age groups was the low dose flu vaccines?

Is there a risk FDA is going to need data against high dose flu vaccines?

 

And from a commercial perspective, do you think you still need high dose flu data, the comparator against high dose flu data given that's what's recommended by CDC in the older population?

And then on danu, should we just – just on the data that we expect before year-end, what do you need to show in that in order to move it into Phase 3 trials?

 

Is something similar to the Phase 2 we saw earlier this year enough to move it to Phase 3.



Albert Bourla

On the flu comparator, I can confirm that it is the low dose on the younger population because that's the only one that's allowed.

 

So on the older population, we are having studies now with a very low dose, but we will do also with the higher dose.

So we have both.

 

On danu, it's not much to say.

We need to wait to see the data.

 

Clearly, when you are moving ahead with a program like that, you need to see the totality of the data and we are working now intensively to be able to have those data presented before year-end.
Operator

Our next question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore.

 



Umer Raffat

I wanted to continue on the oral obesity theme for a second.

 

I noticed there's a new molecule, 522, that you moved into Phase 1.

And my question is, is the chemical structure and the chemical series akin to the danu GLP-1 programs?

 

And also, Albert, you mentioned you want to wait to see the danu GLP-1 Phase 2 data, but I realized the trial has been wrapped up for a few weeks now.

Have you not seen it yet?

 



Albert Bourla

Michael, would you like to take the question about the new molecule and the danu?

 



Mikael Dolsten

We are building a platform around the GLP-1 area and also obesity in general with multiple different mechanisms and compounds.

 

We remain focused on the danuglipron readout, as Albert mentioned, as our main opportunity here for getting data to review for obesity and Type 2 diabetes.

But there are many indications where GLP may play a role outside the typical metabolic.

 

So this one gives us just more options to explore and have interesting data.

And you will see more new mechanism also coming from Pfizer.

 

We have a pretty strong effort here.
Operator

Next we have Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.

 



Terence Flynn

Maybe two for me.

 

I was just wondering, on your RSV launch, how we should think about the potential for revaccination in 2024.

And then, on your DMD gene therapy program, I think you've previously talked about having interim data by year-end.

 

Is that still the case and does the recent competitor data make you more or less optimistic in your program?



Albert Bourla

First of all, let me make a comment that the recent data that we saw about the DMD failures is a very, very bad news for patients.

 

We are really [indiscernible].

I hope there will be a solution for them with the discussion with the FDA, although I can't comment.

 

Now, on our DMD program, I will ask Mikael to comment on that.

And then, on the RSV, Angela.

 

Mikael, why don't you start with the DMD?

Then Angela, go through RSV?

 



Mikael Dolsten

[indiscernible] we also always said and when someone fails a study.

 

We are very encouraged about getting to the readout.

You are right, there is an opportunity for an interim analysis around year-end with final analysis second half of next year.

 

And overall, I think our interim read for DMD have shown a very consistent effect across biomarkers and functional endpoint.

And what has been differentiated it so far is that when you look at the functional data we have reported, it has been giving encouraging signals in both the younger and the slightly older boys.

 

And that has not been seen with the other company you referred to.

So, in a way, I remain, as earlier, very positive about looking forward to the readout and let the data tell the story.

 

But of course, this makes our gene therapy, in a way, the main game to us.



Albert Bourla

Then there was a question, Angela, on the RSV.

 



Angela Hwang

Well, as you heard, during the HCIP discussions, our recommendation for ABRYSVO today is really one around shared clinical decision making.

 

But we also were – we were asked to bring additional data when they are ready.

And so, just to confirm that we will have additional data in vaccine effectiveness in broader populations, we will have safety data also in broader populations, we will also have immunogenicity data in younger populations.

 

All of this will be, I think, available in the next year when we plan to bring this back to the CDC.

In addition to that, actually omitted to mention that we'll also have second season efficacy data.

 

So, we'll be able to bring this totality of data together to determine whether the recommendations will change, but also what the vaccination schedule will be.

So that's to come in 2024.

 
Operator

Next, we have Steve Scala with TD Cowen.

 



Steve Scala

As was just noted a couple of minutes ago, the danu data has reached its primary completion.

 

It was a while ago.

Albert, when you were asked, you stressed the words totality of the data, implying that you could have seen some part of the data.

 

Mikael, when you were asked, you talked about different indications.

These are not confidence building statements.

 

So, I'm curious, what have you seen?

And, Mikael, you've said in the past, you were absolutely encouraged and confident in the profile of danu?

 

Are you still absolutely encouraged and confident?

So that's the first question.

 

Secondly, a competitor spoke to potentially COVID derived decrease in diagnosis of inflammatory diseases, such as UC, and I'm wondering if you've seen any of that.



Albert Bourla

I think you likely misunderstood my comments on the totality.

 

It has nothing to do with any data that I have seen because I haven't, right?

So, the data have not been presented to – I don't think [indiscernible] has been completed yet.

 

So, I will ask also Mikael to comment on that, but don't bridge with anything on the totality of the data.

What I meant it is that we are doing this, we are doing the release formulation, which will make it once a day.

 

There are multiple things, but we need to wait and see.

We see how competitors are doing before deciding what we will do.

 

But the most important thing is to see what is the efficacy and safety of the study that will read out.

So, nothing to read in my comment on historical data.

 

So, Mikael, you want to add…



Mikael Dolsten

Yeah, I can just echo what you said so well, Albert.

 

We and I remain very enthusiastic to look forward, to see the data.

We have not seen the final top line report coming out.

 

So today, the study is still ongoing but will be available before year-end.

Danuglipron has shown, as you know, some really interesting profile as a full agonist and it's our main opportunity and effort for obesity and Type 2 diabetes.

 

We got earlier today a question about new molecules that are coming in.

And that's when I mentioned that our additional indications to pursue for such new molecules and we'll also have new mechanisms that are validated that's coming in in oral version.

 

So it just punctuates our big effort we have around both these class and obesity and other disorders.



Albert Bourla

In essence, he's still excited.

 
Operator

Next, we have Louise Chen with Cantor.

 



Louise Chen

I wanted to ask you on this fourth generation PCV, how much additional serotype coverage will you have?

 

And then, also on ABRYSVO, will that be available to pregnant women in the pharmacy?

Or do they have to go to their OBGYN?

 

And then lastly, just on danuglipron again, here, will you also have the modified release data before year-end.



Albert Bourla

Monadelphous, you want to take the PCV question and danu, but also, Angela, very quickly, ABRYSVO is available at the pharmacy.

 



Angela Hwang

Yes, it's going to be available in pharmacies and doctors' offices and OBGYN offices.

 

I think we have a real stocking advantage here, Louise, because anyone just needs to stock one product for two indications for both populations.

So I think the uptake is to come.

 

And certainly, the next few months, being that it's the winter, is when we begin to – we believe we'll see some good uptake.



Mikael Dolsten

On the PCV fourth generation, I hope you looked at today's data.

 

And what you could see is that we are really the first company that have been able to put in place a whole set of new technology that can bring immune responses to a higher level than have been seen and that allow us to go with even more comprehensive coverage than the current 20.

I'm not going to give your curiosity an answer how many serotype.

 

I can just tell you it's considerable more than the 20.

On danu, we look upon danuglipron as the once-a-day QD molecule because of the reformulation technologies that were put in place and already generated some clinical data on and are now concluding.

 

So that's really how we look upon danuglipron and we'll have final data on the best formulation option early next year.

But as Albert said, we're enthusiastic to look forward to the efficacy data later this year.

 

So very exciting time.
Operator

Next, we have David Risinger with Leerink Partners.

 



David Risinger

I have another question on danuglipron since it appears to be the company's number one pipeline candidate based upon your forecasts.

 

So regarding the Phase 2b results that are expected soon, how should we expect Pfizer to share those results?

And then, with regard to the once daily formulation that you just mentioned, Mikael, will that be ready for the Phase 3 start assuming that the company moves to start Phase 3 shortly after the Phase 2b results are generated?

 



Albert Bourla

The first question, given the importance [indiscernible].

 

But with a press release, we've made them publicly available.

Now, Mikael, you want to take the second part of the question of David?

 



Mikael Dolsten

Yeah, I can first echo what Albert and I said, we look forward with enthusiasm to get the danuglipron obesity data later this year.

 

And of course, as Albert said, pending totality of reviewing everything we have, we have made a lot of progress and been able to accelerate the QD danu.

Now, we're waiting for some more clinical data early next year, but I think it's within our reach.

 

If we decide to do, to start the pivotal study next year to do it with an once a day molecule.
Operator

Next, we have Chris Schott with J.P.

 

Morgan.



Chris Schott

Just two for me here.

 

First, can you just comment a little bit more on what we're seeing with Nurtec and the ramp relative to your expectations?

And maybe just as part of that, just any color on pricing we're seeing within the market today and how we should think about that going forward.

 

And then my second question was on 2024.

I know you're not giving guidance today.

 

But as you look at where consensus has kind of shaken out post the COVID and cost restructuring updates, and if the earnings are in kind of low $3 range at this point, I guess just are there any directional kind of pushes or pulls in the numbers that you feel the Street isn't capturing properly and should be kind of thinking about before we get your kind of formal guidance as we look to early next year?



Dave Denton

Obviously, it's a little over 2024.

 

I would just say that, clearly, we had a clearing event as it relates to our COVID expectations for this year.

So a lot of that risk is behind us as we think about the balance this year.

 

I do expect that the balance of this year will be very informative, particularly in the US as we think about utilization trends, both for vaccination rates, importantly Paxlovid, here in the US that will allow us to have a better clarity as we cycle into 2024 of the utilization around those specific products, which will still be meaningful to us at an enterprise level.

Clearly, when we get to providing guidance, we'll give you a lot of information beneath that, so you can get a good sense of our – importantly, our non-COVID products which continue to trend very favorably and very well.

 

And we can layer on, I'll say, the optionality associated with our COVID franchise as we cycle into next year.

So, obviously, a lot more to come.

 

We're looking forward to sharing those very specific details after the first of the year.



Mark Southey

And then, Angela, about Nurtec launch – not launch, about the Nurtec performance in the marketplace, including the price.

 



Angela Hwang

Thanks for the question, Chris, because it's a great opportunity for us to share that we are seeing Nurtec perform just as we expected.

 

In fact, with some really strong performance indicators that I'd like to share with you.

First of all, from a TRx perspective, we grew 28% compared to last year this time, and sequentially, we grew 6% versus last quarter.

 

In fact, on October 20, we saw the highest week of TRx's and NRxs to date.

That growth is also seen in the number of prescribers.

 

Just this quarter alone, we had 73,000 prescribers writing Nurtec.

And we are now moving at a clip of about 23,000 writer a week which is 30% more than Ubrelvy and double that of Qulipta.

 

Another good place to look is also in new to brand starts, right, NBRxs.

And when you look at that, NBRx growth for Nurtec is higher than Ubrelvy and Qulipta in all the deciles of physicians, but particularly in the decile 8 to 10, which, as you know, is where the highest prescribers are or who are the highest prescribers.

 

And then, when you look at pill count, we see something interesting there too.

We have been very intensely or intently driving our pill pack toward the larger pill pack size, which is the 16 pack because of our prevention indication.

 

And so, when you look at the totality of all the pills or the total volume of pills, we have a leading market share there, more than 50%.

And so, I think when you look at all these indicators, at least from the way that we're looking at it, it's very positive story.

 

It's exactly how we see it.

The expansion into primary care, as you heard in Albert's comments, is what it is that we're after.

 

And today, only 17% of the entire market is oral CGRPs, which tells you that most of the market is still an opportunity for us and represents growth that we're really, really looking forward to.

And I think that we put the right investments in the right places to generate this growth in the future.

 

From a pricing perspective, obviously, it's a product that is rebated, and so I think the way to think about it is that, from a patient perspective, which is where we really put a lot of focus, we want to make sure that our patients are able to get the scripts, are able to get access for Nurtec, especially as you consider that we're trying to mobilize people away from Topiramate and away from triptans on to all CGRPs.

So the gross to net effects here are significant.

 

And you see that quarter-over-quarter because we are making sure that we're able to provide access to patients who deserve and are eligible for [indiscernible].
Operator

Next we have Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.

 



Mohit Bansal

And I have a question regarding your S1P etrasimod.

 

Would love to get your thoughts on the labels.

It seems like you could avoid a lot of cardiac monitoring, but at the same time there is this new requirement of eye exam as well as skin exam.

 

How do you think about uptake, considering these examinations before the start of the treatment, given that these doctors are not used to it?



Mikael Dolsten

I'm happy to start on it.

 

I think we have a very robust label for etrasimod.

It's the only S1P in this drug class [indiscernible] that have a simple flat dosing and immediate start without any prior need for, let's say, cardiac rhythm exams, like the other prog in this class.

 

All S1P have various eye exams to monitor.

And I think our label similarly has a recommendation to do that.

 

So it's really nothing new.

And our efficacy data, and you see, has been very favorable.

 

So we are very optimistic that this can be a true best-in-class ulcerative colitis.



Angela Hwang

I was just going to add to that that, competitively, we believe that we have an excellent efficacy and safety profile.

 

We don't have a need to titrate up, as Mikael said.

And also, our assessment of standard versus our competitors at the initiation of therapy.

 

So I think that this is a level playing field that we're in.

Certainly patient support is an area of focus for us, right, to ensure that patients are getting the assessments that they need.

 

But we feel that we're – this is pretty standard practice and we'll be able to launch this product as planned.
Operator

Next, we have Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.

 



Geoff Meacham

Just have a couple of quick ones.

 

First, I know Seagen obviously hasn't closed yet.

But there's all the emphasis on the ADCs from ESMO.

 

Does it affect how you guys prioritize the pipeline or maybe investments you could make today commercially?

And the second question on danu, Mikael, I know a lot has been asked on the upcoming data, but from a commercial perspective, like where do you see the bigger opportunities for differentiation and metabolic?

 

Is it really just oral administration in obesity?

Or do you guys look more aggressively at related indications like cardio, renal, et cetera.

 



Albert Bourla

Chris, do you want to take a question about the Seagen and the pipeline?

 



Chris Boshoff

Obviously, we remain very confident that we will close Seagen towards the end of this year, beginning next year.

 

As you pointed out, there's a significant interest now in ADCs because of the potential that they could replace most of the chemotherapeutics in the future for most cancer types.

Seagen obviously has a significant track record with both the current approved ADCs from the laboratories and, as you've seen, three potential registration phase trials just read out and passed up to Kaiser [indiscernible] but also with the small molecule to Kaiser.

 

They recently started two Phase 3 studies, one with tisotumab vedotin in combination with pembrolizumab in advanced metastatic, HER2 positive or HER2 low bladder cancer.

This is a program that we're very excited about.

 

Already tisotumab received previously breakthrough therapeutic innovation in the US.

And they're also just about to start another Phase 3 program in non-small cell lung cancer with the B6A integrin beta-6 antibodies.

 

So we remain very confident in their portfolio and the depth of expertise they're bringing to the development and discovery of ADCs.



Mikael Dolsten

I think you asked about how could a new oral GLP in obesity be positioned for maximal attractiveness and using danu as one example, pending, of course, our excitement to see the data.

 

Well, clearly, as obesity and Type 2 diabetes with overweight are moving from being treated from an endocrinologist and metabolic physicians increasingly now to primary care, particularly with the impressive effects of this drug class on obesity and bodyweight.

Oral agents in general are preferred.

 

So I think, once a day drugs such as the new reformulated potential danuglipron would have an interesting role there.

I think there is also a growing discussion among opinion leaders in the field that the patients regain weight when they stop the injectable.

 

And in general, they are only available for maybe a year.

So an oral agent that could be taken for a longer period could also play a really interesting role to maintain body weight at a low level.

 

And finally, you're absolute right, the new data for this drug class suggests that patients could benefit from both cardiac and renal protection.

And oral agents allow you to build combination with drugs that already are used in this population, such as the 52, to protect the heart etc.

 

So I think that's why there is such a big interest in drugs in this class.
Operator

Next, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.

 



Tim Anderson

I have a couple of questions on danuglipron.

 

Early dataset showed a QTc signal.

Do you think that was a red herring that won't show up in later data?

 

To me, when I just think about drug classes and seeing QTc signals, seems like it often persists in later datasets.

Second question on mRNA flu.

 

You mentioned that safety is the same as licensed vaccines.

Does that mean tolerability was as well?

 

I usually think of safety and tolerability as technically being different from each other.



Albert Bourla

Mikael, both questions for you.

 

QTc for danu and tolerability of flu vaccines?



Mikael Dolsten

We have, I think, more than 1,400 patients on danuglipron and it's a very safe drug.

 

It's a very safe drug.

And we look forward to the readout on efficacy, as we have said.

 

before year-end.

So that's very straightforward.

 

mRNA flu, you had a very good comment, particularly in initial studies, tolerability is really what we focus on.

And tolerability was similar to standard of care available vaccines, or the other mRNA vaccines experienced from Pfizer.

 

And we haven't really had any concerns about safety.

So on both tolerability and safety, the statement stands that it looks like previous versions of our vaccines.

 
Operator

Next, we have Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.

 



Chris Shibutani

Two questions, if I may.

 

On the cost savings program, you've been outlining what the plan is for 2024.

But if we look at the pattern of the spending for R&D and SI&A, in the quarter you just reported, I would observe that the magnitude of reduction in the R&D spend was greater than expected relative to SI&A, how should we be interpreting this numbers or anything to read across in terms of the relative amount of cost reductions coming from SI&A versus R&D on the forward?

 

And then a question on ABRYSVO.

First quarter sales were solid.

 

Can you just elaborate how much may have been attributable to, for instance, inventory stocking versus actual demand?

And if we look at prescription data, looks like from the retail setting, there was about a 30% market share.

 

Is this similar to what you're observing in the broader market?

And how is this conferring with your expectations?

 



Mark Southey

Let me ask David to answer the question about the R&D and SI&A expenses.

 

And then Angela will take ABRYSVO.



Dave Denton

Chris, on the cost program, I would not read into the allocation of savings in 2023 as it relates to 2024.

 

Obviously, we have a fairly robust program up and running today.

We're working aggressively on those programs and beginning to implement those programs.

 

As we cycle into 2024, we'll give you and the markets specific color on how to think about those cost savings as we wrap into next year.



Mark Southey

Angela?

 



Angela Hwang

We're really pleased with our performance on ABRYSVO.

 

It has exceeded our expectations.

You first asked whether this is all about stocking.

 

And I can say that it isn't.

Of course, there was stocking effect in the beginning because this was a new vaccine.

 

But we're also closely tracking vaccination rates and uptake.

And what you see is that there is very fast uptake that really benefit from the fact that this was approved and in market prior to the vaccination season actually happening.

 

So it was able to ride off the coattails of flu vaccinations, which you know are very high.

Right?

 

September, October.

We have about a 70% co-administration rate.

 

The performance we're seeing on ABRYSVO is truly driven by vaccinations.

To your comment about market share, yes, we are seeing a similar market share to what you have just said.

 

That is because, right now, the retail setting is driving a lot of the vaccinations.

But don't forget that that's not where all vaccinations are taking place.

 

We also have non-retail settings such as health systems, doctors' offices, those are also being engaged.

And those particular settings, Pfizer actually has a leading preference.

 

They are smaller in proportion, but still.

So I think we have to look at all channels of the market.

 

Finally, I think that, just from a momentum perspective, we expect things to continue.

The vaccinations really are happening throughout this time now – October, November, December are big vaccination months.

 

From where we are right now, RSV is only 5% of the entire vaccination rate of the eligible populations.

So I think that the conclusion is we're very early in the innings of this launch.

 

It's doing better than we thought.

But where we are going to be, I think, is a place where there's tremendous opportunity for driving uptake in older adults, but also maternal, which, as you know, we just got the approval for.

 
Operator

Next, we have Carter Gould with Barclays.

 



Carter Gould

Maybe if you go back to oral danu, when we do get the Phase 2 data, what should our expectation be around communicating plans for Phase 3, which I guess is just a quicker way of saying, what's a reasonable expectation for how quickly you could turn around the Phase 2 and start a Phase 3 and how much work Pfizer has already done on that front?

 

And then, maybe just coming out of ESMO, on the back of the EV-302 data and the response with Pfizer saying that reaffirms their expectations or represents upside to their expectations when the deal was originally announced.



Albert Bourla

On the danu, let me take it, so I can spare a little bit Mikael's time.

 

We are expecting the data to show up before the end of the year.

And of course, it's an important event.

 

So we will have to make it publicly known when we know the data.

And of course, when we are ready with our Phase 3, and we hope that the data are good, so that we can move into Phase 3.

 

And I hope that we are going to do it in an expedient manner because speed is of essence in this battle between competing molecules.

But we will announce our plans for Phase 3.

 

I know the interest is very high right now.

But I want to be very prudent in not saying things without the data.

 

The data or the click of the data, we haven't seen it again.

Now, let me move to Chris, so that we can discuss about the ESMO.

 



Chris Boshoff

Thank you for raising 301.

 

It's a truly monumental data for the field of bladder cancer, and urothelial cancer.

And as you pointed out, with overall survival and median –progression-free survival nearly double, moving median overall survival for this population now nearly towards three years, we expect the final data to be above – longer than 31.5 months.

 

So this just reaffirms our belief that antibody drug conjugates could become a standard of care across the treatment paradigm for many, many different tumor types.
Operator

Next, we have Akash Tewari with Jefferies.

 



Ivy Wang

This is Ivy on for Akash.

 

Our question is also on danuglipron.

So, [indiscernible] release version, is there any possibility to do a bridging study for QD formulation?

 

And also, for danu, I think as we've heard a lot of times on the call that the trial [indiscernible] completed in October.

I know you haven't seen the top line data.

 

So at this point, are we waiting for data from this lower four week titration cohort?

So would it be fair to say that you will have to continue the program already if there were any clinically significant theories, issues with danu?

 



Mikael Dolsten

On the once a day reformulated danu, we have initially tested a standard swellable core technology, and could show that it worked very well with danu.

 

Now to be able also to incorporate a more sophisticated technology, we worked on a matrix technology, and all data suggests it's going to a really intriguing alternative because, as you know, in diabetes oral drugs and obesity, you will over time end up with incorporating different trials to prevent different downstream effects.

And that's the beautiful of having these type of novel technology that you have a potential in the future to go to fix those combination.

 

And we are really masters in developing sophisticated formulations and we will have this available in 2024.



Mark Southey

And there was a second part I think, or not.

 

There was a second part on danu?
Operator

Next we have Kerry Holford with Berenberg.

 



Kerry Holford

Two questions on vaccines for me, please.

 

First on RSV, in August, GSK filed a lawsuit against Pfizer alleging patent infringement.

So I wonder if you could just talk to the next steps here.

 

Perhaps a timeline that you anticipate for this?

And should we think that this could ultimately result in some form of royalty payments from Pfizer to GSK?

 

And then, on PENBRAYA, how does the recent ACIP recommendation set against your expectations for the sales ramp and peak potential for this vaccine?

If the vaccine is effectively only used for dose two of three, does that significantly reduce the commercial opportunity you had anticipated for the vaccine?

 



Doug Lankler

It's very, very early stages with respect to the RSV litigation.

 

We have patents, we feel strongly about our own intellectual property.

And it's certainly too early to say whether one party or the other will be required to pay any royalties or otherwise.

 

Very early stages in that regard.



Angela Hwang

We continue to feel confident about the peak sales.

 

The reason is that, right now, we have the first set of recommendations, but the ACIP has also told us that we will have the opportunity again to come back next year when we have additional data, which is when we will have the opportunity to look at the schedule or how [indiscernible] are being – the schedule that they're being delivered today.

And we'll have an opportunity again to take a look at the benefit of PENBRAYA in this population.

 

So I feel like it's great that we have an opportunity to get out now and to begin vaccinating our teenagers.

We'll have a second bite at the apple, which will allow us to achieve our peak sales.

 
Operator

Next, we have Andrew Baum with Citi.

 



Andrew Baum

A couple of questions.

 

Would you comment on your stake in RVT-3101, the TL1A, pending the approval of the licensing of the asset to Roche?

Will you hang on to it?

 

Or is that subject to divestment?

Second question for Chris.

 

Just looking at the recent EV-302 data and with – you seem to have the Seagen portfolio, when you think about the combination of ADCs with pembro or with a PD-1, do you believe the efficacy that you're seeing is associated with that hedging or do you think it's true synergy through an immunologic mechanism of increased cell death?



Aamir Malik

I think we're very pleased with the outcome of the TL1A program.

 

When we created Televant, we did this as an R&D prioritization decision.

Just as a reminder, this was a Phase 2 program that required significant Phase 3 investment.

 

And so we held on to a 25% stake.

We also had rights to royalties on US sales, as well as the full ex-US and ex-Japan rights.

 

And we did that all without any R&D spend.

So Roche's proposed acquisition of Televant will give us access to about $1.75 billion of pretax cash, which is the translation of our stake, and we still retain all the other rights.

 

So we're looking forward to having Roche as a partner.

We're looking forward to the investments that they're going to make in advancing the clinical stage programs on TL1A and benefiting from the outcome of those.

 



Chris Boshoff

That's a very good question.

 

As you know, Seagen pioneered the MMAE auristatin-based payloads, and we see this potential synergy in combination with a PD-1 with [indiscernible].

Although Seagen does have the next generation of ADCs with topo 1 that will enter the clinic this year – next year, we don't know yet if the topo 1s are going to show the similar type of immunogenicity as what appears to happen with the MMAE auristatin based payloads.

 

So I think we're very confident that Seagen has both topo 1 as well as auristatin based payloads in case with topo 1s we do not see what appears [indiscernible].
Operator

Our last question comes from Evan Seigerman with the BMO Capital Markets.

 



Evan Seigerman

I have one on danu and then a bigger picture one.

 

So, a point of clarification on danuglipron.

Mikael, is the ultimate goal to develop the fixed dose combination with, say, an SGLT2, other anti-diabetes drugs.

 

You kind of mentioned that in your commentary.

And taking a big step back, how should we think about how you risk adjusted your long term revenue guidance?

 

Did you plan on updating this figure as you have clinical or regulatory successes or failures, for example, with the approval of etrasimod?



Mikael Dolsten

The near term goal is really look at the data, as we have said, both Albert and myself, and pending review, of course, there's an option with a once a day danu to move forward in obesity and diabetes.

 

I think we have commented that the upside with oral drugs are many in the sector.

That's why it has been such a big interest.

 

And that includes fixed dose combination, which aren't available with injectables.

But we will keep it simple and clear.

 

We'll review the data and take a decision about potential in obesity and diabetes once a day danu.

That's the near term.

 



Albert Bourla

And also about your question, if we are going to change the $20 billions or the $25 billions that we have declared, first of all, the $25 billion is billions that we're going to acquire revenue in 2030.

 

According to our estimates, we have acquired, pending Seagen acquisition, $20 billion so far.

If you see the analyst expectations for this acquisitions, at the end of 2030, are very, very close to what we have right now.

 

And I think this is trending very nice.

When you see the internal pipe, the launches that we are having from our internal pipeline, which we declared $20 billions, there is a gap between what we believe and what the analysts believe.

 

And this is where we are focusing our attention right now.

It's very early with the launches.

 

Some of them are doing better than what we thought.

Some of them are doing worse than what we thought.

 

And if we realize that the totality of $20 billion is not anymore what we think will be, of course, we will update.



Dave Denton

But I think what is important is that is if you look at our business, our core business is performing nicely.

 

We continue to make traction.

We have obviously a lot of launches that we've completed and still several ahead of us.

 

We're excited about what Seagen could potentially bring to the company as we think about our focus now in oncology.

And then importantly, I think we've rebaselined, if you will, the COVID franchises.

 

Think about utilization in the back half of this year and cycle into next year.

We will then take a step back and look at what would be prudent as we think about the revenue in totality of this company as we cycle into 2024 and beyond.

 

So I think you look forward to, as we begin going into 2024, those expectation of laying those out specifically.



Albert Bourla

Okay, thank you very much.

 

I would like just to say that if you walk away from today's call with just one takeaway, it should be that I think Pfizer's future remains bright.

We have rebased our COVID expectations, and now I think it's very easy for everyone to be able to model what I think will be stable COVID revenues going forward.

 

And with the recent – particularly with the recent amended Paxlovid supply agreement.

And of course, we are having very strong performance of our [indiscernible] and new products portfolio excluding COVID.

 

It's 10% growth this quarter.

And that position us to be able to have growing things going forward.

 

So I will now bring this call to an end.

Thank you for joining us and have a great rest of your day.

 
Operator

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

 

This concludes today's Pfizer third quarter 2023 earnings conference call.

We appreciate your participation and you may disconnect at any time.

Nick Stone

Hello, everyone.

 

It's Nick Stone, Head of Investor Relations.

Welcome to our Year-to-Date and Q3 2023 Results Conference Call and Webcast for Investors and Analysts.

 

The presentation was sent out to our distribution list by email.

And you can also find us on gsk.com.

 

Please turn to Slide 2.

This is the usual safe harbor statements.

 

We will comment on our performance using constant exchange rates, or CER, unless stated otherwise.

As a reminder, following the Consumer Healthcare demerger in 2022 to form Haleon, we're representing performance and growth of the continuing operations for GSK.

 

Please turn to Slide 3.

Today's call will last approximately one hour with the management presentation taking around 30 minutes and the remaining time for your questions.

 

[Operator Instructions] Our speakers are Emma Walmsley, Tony Wood, Luke Miels, Deborah Waterhouse and Julie Brown, with David Redfern joining the rest of the team for the Q&A portion of the call.

I'll now hand the call over to Emma.

 



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Nick, and welcome to everybody joining us today.

 

I am delighted to be presenting to you all with another set of excellent quarterly results.

Please turn to the next slide.

 

Sales and profits grew double-digits for the quarter, with sales up 16% to £8.1 billion, adjusted operating profit up 22% to £2.8 billion, and adjusted earnings per share up 25% to £0.504, all excluding pandemic solutions.

Our strong performance was broadly based and benefitted particularly from the outstanding US launch of our RSV vaccine, Arexvy, on track to be a blockbuster in its first year on the market.

 

This excellent execution together with our drive for efficiency and margin accretion, means we can upgrade our 2023 sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS guidance.

For the year, we now expect sales to increase between 12% and 13%, adjusted operating profit to increase between 13% and 15%, and adjusted EPS to increase between 17% and 20%.

 

Within sales, we are upgrading the outlooks across all segments for the year, reflecting our clear momentum.

Our performance also clearly demonstrates delivery of the strategic choices we've made to invest in prevention, as well as the treatment of disease.

 

New products launched since 2017 have contributed sales of £7.8 billion so far this year, with nearly 80% of them coming from Vaccines and Specialty Medicines.

Approvals this year for Arexvy and Apretude, together with two important oncology medicines Jemperli and, most recently, Ojjaara, further strengthen this new product portfolio, and offer meaningful sources of profitable growth.

 

So taken altogether, this is a strong and sustained performance heading into 2024.

Next slide, please.

 

This quarter, further underscore the importance and strength of our Vaccines' business.

Prevention is an increasing focus for healthcare systems all around the world.

 

GSK is a world leader in vaccines and is extremely well-placed to deliver innovation and offer value to both individuals and payers.

The introduction of Arexvy in the US is evidence of this, demonstrating our strong launch capabilities because with over £700 million of sales and its very first quarter as we protect people at scale from this life-threatening disease, and especially those with comorbidities.

 

Generating further clinical evidence for Arexvy remains a clear priority and we were pleased to present positive data in adults aged 50 to 59 years at the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last month.

We also added to the outstanding clinical profile of the Shingrix this quarter.

 

Results of the large post-marketing study in China demonstrating a 100% efficacy.

And alongside this, we're additionally significantly expanding availability of Shingrix in China, our exclusive partnership with Zhifei signed last month is going to support and accelerate our goal to Shingrix's annual sales of more than £4 billion by 2026, and with opportunities to expand this partnership further, including potentially with Arexvy.

 

Our innovation in RSV, shingles, meningitis and pediatrics, all demonstrate our world-leading vaccines capabilities.

And we have further substantial innovation in the pipeline where we have our comprehensive and leading suite of vaccine platform technologies, including next-generation mRNA, our multiple antigen presenting system, or MAPS, as well as, of course, as our adjuvant systems.

 

All of these offer exciting new opportunities in seasonal respiratory, bacterial and chronic viral infections, and we continue to explore the science beyond infectious diseases.

Next slide, please.

 

Alongside delivering stronger shareholder returns, we also continue to build trust by delivering across the six key areas we prioritize for ESG.

This quarter, I'm highlighting our continued commitment to fight malaria with innovation.

 

GSK scientists working with Johns Hopkins Institute and others published their groundbreaking discovery of the naturally-occurring bacteria that can significantly reduce the malaria parasite load in mosquitoes, indicating the potential to inhibit transmission of malaria to humans.

And we also continue to deliver our environment and diversity, equity and inclusion goals.

 

Further details, along with more, on all six key areas are included in the Q3 results announcement.

Now, let's hear more from the team on our progress, starting with Tony and R&D.

 



Tony Wood

Thank you, Emma.

 

My priority is investing in our pipeline and accelerating R&D to deliver new vaccines and medicines to patients.

Today, the pipeline comprises 67 assets in clinical development, two-thirds of these prevent and treat infectious diseases and HIV.

 

During the quarter, we've seen continued progress.

In infectious diseases, we're focused on seasonal respiratory viruses, bacterial, fungal and chronic viral infections.

 

In seasonal respiratory viruses, Arexvy received approval in Japan as the country's first RSV vaccine for older adults.

And we also shared positive data for 50-year-olds to 59-year-olds with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in the US.

 

In chronic viral infections, we will present data later this month on bepirovirsen, a potentially transformative treatment for chronic hepatitis B.

I'll talk more about these data shortly.

 

In HIV, the European Medicines Agency approved Apretude as the first and only HIV prevention option in combination with safer sex practices to reduce the risk of sexually-acquired HIV infection in high-risk adults and adolescents.

For respiratory, Japan accepted the regulatory submission of Nucala for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and later this month alongside Luke, I look forward to providing you with insights into our respiratory strategy and medicines at the next focused Meet the Management event.

 

For oncology, the European Medicines Agency recommended not renewing conditional marketing authorization for Blenrep.

As a reminder, given the changing regulatory environment, our expectations remain low for the event-driven DREAMM-7 and DREAMM-8 Phase III trials.

 

We now expect to read these out in 2024.

This quarter, we also reached an exclusive licensing agreement with Hansoh for a Phase I B7-H4 targeted antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC.

 

We believe this has best-in-class potential in ovarian and endometrial cancer with opportunities in other solid tumors.

Lastly, we're delighted with the US FDA approval of Ojjaara, or momelotinib, which is indicated for treating myelofibrosis in adults with anemia, and the approval of Jemperli, our highly effective PD-1 inhibitor, as the first new frontline treatment for patients with dMMR/MSI-High primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.

 

The profile for Jemperli was strengthened by the recent interim analysis of RUBY Part 1, which reported a statistically significant and clinically meaningful survival benefit in the overall population enrolled.

We aim to present these OS data at a conference early next year.

 

Next slide, please.

Last week, we presented further safety and immunogenicity data for Arexvy to ASIP.

 

The vaccine met its co-primary endpoints and demonstrated non-inferiority in people aged 50 to 59 years of age, when compared with adults of six years and older, including those at increased risk of RSV lower respiratory tract disease.

These data continue to demonstrate the consistent strength of Arexvy's profile in protecting the most vulnerable.

 

We will make a supplementary biological licenses application to the US FDA before the end of this year in time for next year's ASIP to further support potential label updates.

For Shingrix, we continue to build our knowledge with new data demonstrating 100% efficacy in the prevention of shingles in China for adults aged 50 and over, a remarkable result.

 

We expect to publish these data in a peer-reviewed scientific journal before the end of the year.

Slide 11, please.

 

Continuing with infectious diseases, bepirovirsen, our triple-action antisense oligonucleotide, has the potential to be the cornerstone of functional cure for patients with chronic hepatitis B.

It inhibits viral replication, reducing viral DNA, and thus the production of viral proteins including hepatitis B surface antigen.

 

And importantly, it stimulates the body's innate immune system.

We believe this triple mechanism-of-action is the reason for bepi's unique profile.

 

There are more than 300 million people living with hepatitis B and our goal is to provide patients with the first clinically meaningful functional cure for hepatitis B, eliminating the need for continued therapy and ultimately reducing the long-term risk of developing liver cirrhosis and cancer.

We now have two completed Phase II trials, for which data are consistent and demonstrate that patients with low surface antigen have the greatest chance of a functional cure when treated with bepi.

 

In the case of B-Together, this is not significantly improved by sequential Peg-interferon treatment.

However, the recent exclusive license of Janssen's Phase II small interfering RNA-based therapeutic provides a complementary opportunity to develop a potential novel sequential regimen to benefit a broader patient population and potentially drive higher functional cure rates.

 

Lastly, we hope data from B-Sure will be presented later this month at AASLD.

This will demonstrate a durable response for a significant proportion of patients treated with bepi.

 

Our Phase III trials B-Well 1 and B-Well 2 are progressing as planned in 31 countries with data anticipated in 2025.

Turning to my final slide.

 

This slide highlights important clinical data readouts and regulatory events over the upcoming months.

You can find a comprehensive overview in the appendix.

 

In summary, I'm pleased with our progress so far this year.

We have clear plans to move forward at pace, deliver on our key objectives for R&D and support GSK's overall growth ambitions.

 

I'll now hand it over to Luke on Slide 13.



Luke Miels

Thanks, Tony.

 

In Q3, we again delivered growth across Vaccines and Specialty Medicines in each region with £8.1 billion of sales, up 16% versus last year, excluding pandemic solutions.

Please turn to Slide 15.

 

In Vaccines, we saw strong growth of 34% in the quarter excluding pandemic solutions, led by the excellent launch of Arexvy, which contributed £709 million.

On the same basis, we now expect full year Vaccines sales growth to be around 20%.

 

On Arexvy, I want to highlight the excitement our organization has had behind the launch that we've seen in the US.

Following an initial inventory build, we saw high demand and received two out of every three retail prescriptions.

 

In the quarter, we saw around 50% of Arexvy doses were co-administered with flu.

And we're pleased with our commercial positioning in all major pharmacies, including competitive contracts with 11 key accounts.

 

We strategically chose to highlight our 94.6% efficacy in the co-morbid population and that message seems to resonate well with strong HCP brand recognition.

There's a long runway for Arexvy in the US, where during the quarter, we vaccinated more than 1.4 million adults of the 83 million at-risk, and ex-US, as launches are underway across Europe and Canada.

 

In September, we also received approval in Japan.

We remain confident in our peak sales being greater than £3 billion.

 

For the full year, we expect sales to be between £0.9 billion and £1 billion, based on an analogue of flu vaccination seasonality.

However, there continue to be unknown factors including annual vaccination patents, duration of protection and what re-vaccination recommendations might be.

 

We will continue to keep you informed of course as we learn more.

Next slide, please.

 

Moving to Shingrix, this remains an important vaccine for our portfolio, up 15% versus last year with the ex-US contribution now representing 50% of sales.

In addition to the US, Shingrix is available in 38 additional countries, with less than 3% penetration in most markets, and we continue to have unconstrained supply.

 

In the US, we have reached the most motivated consumers with 33% penetration of more than 120 million adults recommended to receive Shingrix.

We remain encouraged by the growth in retail, which was up 4% in the quarter and are investing in strategic initiatives to actively target consumers and HCPs to access the next tranche of customers.

 

In October, we announced the deal with Zhifei to co-promote Shingrix in China, and this partnership materially expands the number of Chinese adults who can benefit from Shingrix over the next three years through a company with a track record of driving access to innovative medicines and vaccines in China.

Zhifei has a significant reach across China with an extensive service network covering more than 30,000 point of vaccination versus the current 9,500 we have now.

 

As Emma mentioned, we expect this partnership to support and accelerate our expectations for Shingrix sales to reach more than £4 billion by 2026.

Next slide, please.

 

In Specialty Medicines, including HIV, which Deborah will cover shortly, we've increased our sales by 17% excluding Xevudy.

For the full year, we now expect low-double-digit sales growth.

 

Our market-leading medicines Benlysta and Nucala continue to deliver double-digit growth.

Benlysta was up 20% in the quarter, with growth across all major markets and a promising opportunity with updated EULAR guidelines now recommending use earlier as part of a standard-of-care for lupus and lupus nephritis.

 

Nucala was up 19% in the quarter and remains the first and only biologic approved in four eosinophilic diseases.

We expect to see COPD data for Nucala in the second half of next year.

 

Both of these medicines continue to have room to grow with relatively low buyer penetration and lifecycle opportunities, underscoring our confidence in the long-term opportunity for both.

In oncology, sales were up 26% in the quarter with Jemperli now being used in the first-line for appropriate endometrial cancer patients, and Zejula was up 22% due to stocking of our new tablet formulation, providing an improved patient experience.

 

We expect this stock will be utilized by the end of the year.

And on this slide, I wanted to highlight the recent approval of our myelofibrosis medicine Ojjaara.

 

In addition to a line-agnostic label in the US, regulators acknowledged our unique benefit in anemia, an especially important characteristic for these patients as we know that anemia status from requirements of transfusion directly correlate with poor survival prognosis and quality-of-life.

And as you can see on this chart, if you're a myelofibrosis patient with no anemia, you have a median eight-year life expectancy.

 

Conversely, you have a two-year life expectancy, if you're severely anemic.

So, for example, your hemoglobin level is below eight.

 

We look forward to making this medicine available to patients and have already recorded sales in September.

And when these updates, we are raising our full year oncology sales expectations to increase to low-single digit.

 

Please turn to Slide 18.

Finally, our General Medicines portfolio continues to contribute more than £2 billion in the quarter, led by Trelegy, which was up 23%.

 

Trelegy is the fastest-growing triple therapy for COPD and asthma with room to grow as the SITT class still only has 28% penetration of the COPD patient class share in the US.

Overall, General Medicines were down 2% for the quarter due to negative RAR impact, slightly offset by Trelegy demand and continued post-pandemic recovery of the EU and international antibiotic market.

 

Taking everything into account, we now anticipate low- to mid-single-digit growth this year.

And with that, I'll now hand over to Deborah to cover HIV.

 



Deborah Waterhouse

Thank you, Luke.

 

Our HIV business delivered sales of £1.6 billion in the third quarter, growing 15%.

This growth was primarily driven by patient demand, which contributed 10 percentage points of growth, with the majority of the remaining 5 points from tender phasing in our international business.

 

Our continued strong performance through this quarter means we are now increasing our guidance for full year growth to around 10%.

Our performance benefited from strong patient demand for our oral two-drug regimens and long-acting injectable medicines, which are now 53% of our total portfolio value.

 

Dovato delivered £477 million in the quarter.

Market performance reflects HCP belief in Dovato, which has firmly consolidated its position as the leading oral two-drug regimen.

 

I'd like to spend a few moments describing our expectations around Dolutegravir's loss of exclusivity.

In Europe, the composition-of-matter patent expires in July 2029.

 

In the US, Dolutegravir is protected by a composition-of-matter patents until April 2028, which includes an additional six months of exclusivity, following the completion of our pediatric studies.

Dovato and Juluca are also protected by formulation and other patents in the US, which have expiry date after the composition-of-matter patents.

 

Therefore, we anticipate a longer exclusivity period in the US with Dovato until December 2029 and Juluca until July 2030.

Moving to our long-acting injectable portfolio.

 

Cabenuva sales for the quarter were £182 million, reflecting strong patient demand with high levels of market access and reimbursements across the US and Europe.

Cabenuva continues to be supported by strong label evolution and data, which underpins confidence.

 

Patient awareness of Cabenuva is high at over 70% and around two-thirds of switches are coming from competitor products.

Moving on to prevention.

 

Sales of Apretude, the world's first long-acting injectable for the prevention of HIV, delivered £37 million in the quarter, and we are pleased by the momentum across the US.

This, alongside the desire by prescribers, payers and governments for new solution to help end the HIV epidemic, gives confidence that the PrEP market in the US will continue to grow strongly.

 

We were also pleased to receive European approval for Apretude in September.

We're also pleased by the progress of our pipeline, which is focused on innovative long-acting regimens.

 

We have three clear target medicine profiles to provide the world's first self-administered long-acting regimen for treatment, and to provide ultra long-acting regimens for treatments and prevention.

In our recent HIV Meet the Management event, we confirmed that we are currently on track to deliver an every four-month injectable regimen.

 

This would enable us to double the dosing interval, enabling clinic visits to be halved to just three per year, meaningfully increasing the benefit of long-acting regimens for patients and healthcare systems.

The four-monthly dosing and prevention, we said we currently expect approval in the 2026 timeframe, and for four monthly treatments in 2027.

 

We also provided greater clarity on our roadmap to further extend the dosing interval of our long-acting regimens in treatment and prevention to enable every six month dosing towards the end of the decade.

To conclude, we remain very confident in our ambition to achieve a five year sales CAGR to 2026 of 6% to 8% and to maintain our innovation leadership in HIV.

 

This, combined with the continued growth of the long-acting market, gives us the potential to significantly replace the revenue from the Dolutegravir loss of exclusivity.

I will now hand over to Julie.

 



Julie Brown

Thank you, Deborah, and good afternoon, everyone.

 

As you've heard from the team, we've made great progress on our roadmap since the second quarter results and we're well-positioned heading into the end of the year.

We continue to be focused on execution, our pipeline, capital allocation and investor engagement.

 

And as Tony mentioned, we've had several regulatory approvals, including Ojjaara and Jemperli during the third quarter.

And following our HIV Meet the Management event in September, we look forward to holding a similar event focused on respiratory on the 30th of November.

 

Please now turn to Slide 22.

Turning to the quarter, as I cover the financials, references to growth are at constant exchange rates, and I'll focus my comments on adjusted results.

 

So, starting with the income statement.

Sales increased 16% excluding COVID solutions and were up 10% overall, reflecting continued strong execution with the extremely successful launch of Arexvy.

 

Gross margin improved 80 basis points, excluding COVID and 360 basis points at CER, including the impact of lower sales of Xevudy.

SG&A growth was 14% excluding COVID.

 

And as a reminder, in Q3 last year, we have foreign exchange gains on the Vir collaboration, which contributed 3 points to reported SG&A growth this quarter due to the credit last year.

Adjusted operating profit grew 22% excluding COVID solutions and 15% overall.

 

The margin increased to 34%, driven largely by cost of goods improvements and operating leverage.

Turning to the reported results.

 

Total operating profit increased 83% to £1.9 billion, and this was driven by overall performance as well as favorable CCL movements and fair value gains from our stake in Haleon.

The reconciliation of total to adjusted results is included in the appendix.

 

On currency, there was an adverse 6 point impact on sales and 9 points on adjusted operating profit, primarily due to the strengthening of sterling against the US dollar.

Please now turn to Slide 23.

 

Moving to the adjusted operating margin dynamics in the quarter.

The margin increased to 170 basis points to 35% at CER and improved 180 basis points, excluding COVID solutions.

 

Overall, cost of goods has been favorable, primarily reflecting reduced sales of lower-margin Xevudy and an improvement in mix towards Specialty and Vaccines.

Regarding SG&A, we are in an investment cycle, supporting our priority products.

 

Our spend is focused on maximizing the launch of Arexvy, building awareness of RSV, and catalyzing the global market expansion opportunity for Shingrix.

We now have approval in 39 countries for Shingrix and 18 countries for Arexvy.

 

Specialty Medicines is also a targeted investment area, with clear opportunities for the long-acting HIV franchise and the launch of Ojjaara in oncology.

We confirm our guidance for SG&A this year with the growth broadly in-line with sales.

 

It is important to say that following a period of investment, we now expect to move to a period of delivering returns on that investment and building on the great foundation of performance.

In this new cycle, SG&A growth will step down and will be accretive to profits in 2024.

 

Next slide, please.

Adjusted earnings per share grew 17% overall and benefited from lower net finance expense following debt restructuring and the favorable tax rate, partly offset by higher ViiV profits, leading to an increase in non-controlling interests.

 

Next slide, please.

Cash generated from operations was £4.4 billion in the year-to-date and £1.4 billion lower than the prior year.

 

There are two major items to call out: firstly, the receipt of the Gilead settlement last year of £0.9 billion; and secondly, the increase in working capital, influenced by stronger Arexvy sales in Q3 and lower Xevudy collections.

The Arexvy sales will come through in the fourth quarter cash flow.

 

Free cash flow more than doubled to £1.7 billion in the third quarter and brought the nine month year-to-date to an inflow of £1.3 billion.

Cash expectations for the year have improved, but we still anticipate that 2023 cash generated from operations will be slightly lower than 2022 due to the one-off we've seen from Gilead last year.

 

We confirm our commitment of more than £10 billion of cash generated from ops by 2026.

Net debt stands at £17.6 billion with free cash inflow and proceeds from the Haleon stake are partly deployed through business development on the acquisition of BELLUS healthcare.

 

Turning to the guidance on Slide 26.

Given our sustained strong performance across all segments in the business, we are upgrading our guidance at CER for the full year.

 

And as a reminder, our guidance excludes the impact of COVID-19.

We now expect sales to increase 12% to 13%.

 

We expect adjusted operating profit to increase between 13% and 15%, and adjusted earnings per share to increase 17% to 20%.

The strength of the Arexvy launch has been ahead of our initial expectations and is the main source of the guidance upgrade.

 

Q3 sales of Arexvy benefited from strong demand and initial channel inventory build, with TRx volumes representing around one-third of the volumes sold.

As Luke referenced, we are projecting our forecast for the season in line with the high-dose flu analogues, and therefore expect full year sales of around £0.9 billion to £1 billion.

 

There is however, still much to learn given the novel nature of this new vaccine, including annual vaccination patterns, duration of protection, competitor dynamics and what expert recommendations might be, and we anticipate further insight following the end of the US flu season, which will inform our outlook for 2024.

We look forward to updating you further as part of our full year results and remain confident in our longer-term revenue ambition for Arexvy.

 

Turning to the dynamics within upgraded guidance.

Within sales, we're increasing our expectations across all product groups.

 

We now anticipate Vaccine growth of around 20%.

Specialty Medicines to grow low double-digits.

 

And within this, HIV to grow around 10%.

And General Medicines to grow low- to mid-single digits.

 

Moving down the P&L to operating profit, we now expect royalties to be around £900 million with no change to our expectations for the other lines of the P&L.

To EPS, we expect lower interest expense of between £650 million and £700 million.

 

In terms of currency, if exchange rates were to hold at the closing rates on the 30th of September for the rest of the year, the estimated adverse impact on sterling turnover growth for the full year would be minus 2% and on adjusted operating profit growth, it would be minus 4%.

Finally, we remind you of a few modeling assumptions in 2024, namely the impact of AMP cap, the loss of Gardasil royalties and the tax rate likely being a couple of percentage points higher due to OECD legislation.

 

More details on these are included in our pre-quarterly aide memoire, and I look forward to guiding more fully at the end of the year.

And thank you, and with that, I will hand back to Emma.

 



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Julie.

 

Turning lastly to Slide 27.

So, in summary, we are seeing strong and sustained improvements in our performance.

 

This quarter marks the seventh consecutive quarter of competitive sales and profit growth, which supports an upgrade to our guidance for the year.

We also remain very focused on strengthening our pipeline and our longer-term outlooks with progress in vaccines, developments of our long-acting HIV portfolio and new prospects in respiratory, all pointing to new growth opportunities for GSK.

 

We have strong performance as we enter 2024, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.

Thank you for listening.

 

And let's now please all move to the Q&A.



A - Nick Stone

Thanks.

 

[Operator Instructions] With that, I'd like to take our first question from Graham Parry.

Graham, over to you.

 



Graham Parry

Great.

 

Thanks, Nick.

Thanks for taking my question.

 

So, I'd start with Arexvy.

So, it's question on the level of discounting in the initial launch.

 

So, two-thirds of your £709 million was inventory and you've administered some, I think, 1.4 million, 1.5 million doses.

That means underlying sales are in the sort of £230 million to £240 million range, and that would imply net price probably more than 30% below the list price.

 

So, can I just check that's the right sort of ballpark?

And is that mostly wholesaler discounting or retail pharmacy discounting to drive the initial inventory build and something which we might see sort of ameliorates little bit over time, or is that just kind of where the competitive nature of the market is at the moment?

 

And then secondly, I know, Julie you touched on this, but dynamics into next year, just be interested [Technical Difficulty] you obviously won't have the initial inventory build, but how much of that inventory do you think is just sort of [Technical Difficulty] you don't have the return of the patient -- people you vaccinated this year.

So, any thoughts you have so far on how far penetrated you are into the easy wins of the more elderly comorbid et cetera, and how much tougher it might be to get return or to new people to get vaccinated next year?

 

Thank you.



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Graham.

 

Well, we'll come to Julie in a minute on guidance and thoughts around next year, although obviously, we will mainly be giving you thoughts around next year when we come to February 2024.

And I would just remind everybody that whilst we are absolutely delighted with the fast and competitive start here on RSV, it is just the start, it's the first season, and we remain very ambitious to the £3 billion, at least that we expect this asset to represent.

 

But let's go to Luke first, noting, Graham, you will fully understand we're not going to be declaring all our commercial details on this call.

But Luke, do you want to comment more broadly?

 



Luke Miels

Yeah, Graham, thank you.

 

I mean, I think we've been quite disciplined taking a longer-term around pricing and contracting and it's landed quite well.

I won't give you any more color than that in terms of the percentages at this point because I'm sure our friends in New York have probably got up a little bit early this morning.

 

But what I would say is to build on Emma's point, I think in the short-term, things are uncertain.

We're very happy with the launch.

 

In the long-term, we're very certain.

I think so far, if we look at some of the metrics which I can try and help you with, it's about 50% co-administration with flu.

 

This is a very large overlap with that population.

And interestingly, around 15% of people are getting free shots when they come into the pharmacy.

 

85% is that 65 to 84 age population.

So again, very similar to high-dose flu.

 

And I think for the rest of the year, in terms of demand, you're still seeing good market research in terms of HCPs recommending it, so it's about 64% based on our latest market research, which is encouraging.

And of course, the CDC is advising doctors to keep going.

 

So that's on a positive side of the ledger.

But the fact is this -- our working hypothesis that this is more of a flu-like trajectory.

 

And as people start coming into pharmacies and we see a reduction in staffing levels of pharmacy who actually deliver these vaccines, then we're going to see a drop-off in demand.

And that's our hypothesis at this point.

 

We'll obviously have a lot more color in Q4 to give you an update.

And then as Emma said, I think we're very, very confident in terms of the £3 billion number that we have outlined in the past.

 



Emma Walmsley

And obviously, looking forward to running forward with that 50-year-olds to 59-year-olds data too, which is another potentially meaningful cohort.

 

Julie, anything else you want to add?



Julie Brown

No, I think actually Luke has covered it extremely well.

 

I think we've obviously looked at the levels of stock in the channel.

We've looked at the rate of immunizations.

 

We've seen a correlation with flu as Luke mentioned very, very close and that's really informed our guidance.

And in terms of 2024, I mean.

 

I think we're going to -- as we come through the US flu season, we are going to have a much clearer view of 2024 when we give our full year results.

So, we will definitely update you at that stage, more fully.

 



Emma Walmsley

Thanks.

 

Next question, please.



Nick Stone

Okay.

 

Next question is going to be from Kerry Holford at Berenberg.

Kerry, over to you, please.

 



Kerry Holford

Thank you.

 

I have a couple of questions for Tony, please, within R&D.

So, firstly, on bepirovirsen, so now you've got the full reach of your Phase II data, and you've recently signed that deal with J&J to look at sequential therapy, do you still remain confident you offer hep B patients the functional cure, at least a proportion of them?

 

What do you expect that J&J siRNA to add here?

And do you stand by your more than £2 billion sales target for that asset?

 

And then secondly, a broader question on R&D budgets.

So here, we've seen significant growth in your budgets over the past 18 months or so.

 

And based on the pipeline you have ahead of you, are you broadly happy with the annual budget that you've effectively been given this year?

The run rate looks to be about £5.5 billion.

 

Or should we expect that R&D budget to continue to grow in the sort of low-double-digit range that we've seen year-to-date going forward?

Thank you.

 



Tony Wood

Thanks, Kerry.

 

Let's get started with HBV, and then I'll comment on the pipeline, but perhaps, Emma, you might want to make your comment on R&D budget.

So, first of all, look, I'm really pleased with this deal, Kerry.

 

Let me just remind you because I'm going to anchor it in what we are -- what we know about bepi and becoming increasingly confident about that is in the context of monotherapy on top of nucleoside treatment, that we achieve a durable functional cure for a significant proportion of the HBV population, the chronic HBV patient population.

And that's for individuals that have a surface antigen count of less than 3,000.

 

Just as a reminder, that's about 40% of the 300 million individuals who are living with chronic hepatitis B.

To put it in a nutshell, what the new deal with the J&J siRNA does is takes the broader population down to that target population of about 3,000 and below.

 

So, you should expect, and we're excited about the prospects, therefore, of seeing both an increased coverage in an ITT population and also a deepening of the therapeutic effect.

And this is important if you look at the mechanism of action of the J&J siRNA.

 

It works in, excuse me, a complementary fashion to bepi, so further lowering viral DNA and the consequences of that, as I mentioned in the presentation.

The other important thing is that we've built a complex PKPD model around response, which this will add to.

 

And in addition, using AIML and some really deep phenotyping on nearly 500 patients, established an understanding of the immune status required at the beginning of treatment for response.

We're going to continue to add to that because with the deal in question, we get a number of ongoing Phase II studies.

 

So, I'm really very pleased about where we are with that particular deal.

For me, it strengthens my expectations in terms of our ability to deliver a functional cure for a broader population of patients living with this disease.

 

Let me just in terms of the question about R&D budget and growth, perhaps I'd just say a few brief things about the portfolio and then hand over to Emma.

So again, I'm really very pleased with where we are on the portfolio.

 

Emma mentioned the strength that we have in our growing vaccines portfolio, particularly next year, as you'll see, more data coming from our mRNA platform, from MAPS, and we have a number of important studies, like, for example, therapeutic herpes simplex vaccine readout on POC that will again continue to hopefully deepen the importance of our adjuvant technology that is underscoring, I think, the fantastic clinical performance we see for Shingrix and for Arexvy.

Luke and I will say more at Meet the Management about the cornerstones of depemokimab, Nucala and camlipixant.

 

In our respiratory portfolio, of course, I just mentioned bepi.

And then moving again just briefly into oncology, Jemperli, most recently through the OS data that I mentioned earlier, continues to show its credentials as a very highly effective PD1 inhibitor.

 

And with all of that in place, I think we're well set with regards to our future ambitions and the budget required for that ambition.

I'm in good shape about it.

 

Emma?



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Tony.

 

I mean, I think that there are two important things to emphasize strongly here.

First of all, we've been very clear in our capital allocation framework.

 

The number one priority for the company is to invest in the pipeline, organic and inorganically.

And that is why, over the last five years, you've seen a significant step up in our R&D spending.

 

What matters is not how much you spend, but that you spend it super smartly and then that is ever-improving and we're continuing to fuel competitive, profitable growth for our shareholders.

So, the first thing is it is a priority, but it's about how we spend it.

 

And I think we are broadly at more industry norm levels in terms of spending, but very much focused on the returns of that.

And the second thing is we are absolutely committed to profitable growth and we're in that chapter now.

 

We're now in, I think, seven consecutive quarters of competitive growth.

Glad to upgrade guidance for the year.

 

Very confident about our '26 outlooks and our double-digit profit CAGR.

This year, we expect R&D spend to increase slightly below our turnover levels.

 

And we're not going to set an explicit target around that, but you can be very confident that the outlooks we previously laid out, we're completely committed to and delighted about our progress against.

Next question, please.

 



Nick Stone

Okay.

 

The next question is from Simon Baker at Redburn.

Simon, over to you, please.

 



Simon Baker

Thank you, Nick.

 

Thank you for taking my questions.

Two, if I may, please, both on the pipeline.

 

And apologies if I missed it, because I did lose sound at one point.

But it looks like depemokimab is running slightly ahead of previous expectations.

 

I just wondered if you can give us an update there on the [SWIFT] (ph) and the SWIFT-2 study timeline.

And then secondly, on the Hansoh ADC, I wonder if you could just elaborate a bit on what attracted you to that asset.

 

Obviously, we've not seen much data.

You all have seen more than us.

 

And I was wondering if it was data-driven or whether it was driven by the fact that the payload and the [linker bar one or two carbons] (ph) is identical to Dato-Dxd and therefore gives you a high level of confidence in the potential of that ADC.

Thanks so much.

 



Emma Walmsley

Thanks.

 

Well, I'll come to Tony on both of those.

But just a flag, please do join us on the 30th of -- or at least Tony and Luke, I should say, on the 30th of November when they will update you on some -- the very exciting scale assets we have in respiratory, obviously our homeland and our heartland, including [depe] (ph) and camlipixant as well.

 

But Tony, you might want to comment a bit more on the trials that are ongoing and then also on the ADC, which is obviously completely in line with our [Onc] (ph) strategy.



Tony Wood

Sure.

 

Thanks, Emma.

Hi, Simon.

 

Yeah, I'm pleased with the progress we're making on SWIFT-1 and SWIFT-2.

As you've spotted, we've seen a slight acceleration in that, that was associated actually with also an acceleration in the ANCHOR study for nasal polyps.

 

What that means is that the safety database that we need to underpin the file is now complete.

You should expect, though, that we'll stay on schedule with regards to the analysis and publication of the data and I won't be doing that until we get the results for the second SWIFT analysis, which still places us in the first half of next year.

 

As far as the ADC deal is concerned, Simon, so, yes, as you quite rightly point out, in terms of linker payload, there are similarities to Dato-Dx and therefore we derive confidence from the improved profile that you see for ADCs carrying that linker payload.

Two important things, though, to stress in the context of this deal.

 

One, the antigen B7-H4 is selectively expressed on gynecological cancers.

That's why we went after the mechanism in line with our strategy for focus on women's cancers and heme.

 

And lastly, in that area as well, there is ample evidence of use of topoisomerase inhibitors as standard of care for chemotherapy.

That's related in part probably to the fact that you see a lot of DNA instability in those cancers, and as I'm sure you're aware, topoisomerases work on that mechanism.

 



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Tony.

 

Next question, please.



Nick Stone

So, next question is going to be from Andrew Baum at Citi.

 

Andrew, over to you, please.



Emma Walmsley

Hey, Andrew.

 



Nick Stone

Andrew, you're there?

 



Andrew Baum

Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

 

Two questions, please.

One for Luke and the other one for Tony.

 

So, for Luke, could you talk to the impact of the removal of the Medicaid cap, the MP cap on your Gen Med business, particularly respiratory next year in terms of quantifying the impact on revenue and earnings.

And then for Tony, or I guess Kim [ph], if she's on.

 

There was recently reported the ATHENA cohort with Cabotegravir+Rilpivirine.

There was a number of cases of viral rebound resistance, particularly in patients with high BMI or weight gain.

 

Should we expect any label change as a function of observations in that cohort?

And it was limited number, but still it was notable and remarked upon.

 

Thank you.



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Andrew.

 

We'll come to Deborah actually on the HIV pipeline first and then Luke back to you on AMP cap.



Deborah Waterhouse

Thanks, Andrew.

 

So the ATHENA is a cohort study.

It was presented at EACS eight to ten days ago.

 

Actually, the finding is exactly in line with our clinical studies.

So, as you know, there are kind of three characterized things that give you a higher likelihood of failing with Cab+Rilpivirine.

 

Weight is one, so high BMI is one.

And then obviously A6, A1 sort of subtypes.

 

And then lastly, if you're resistant to Rilpivirine.

So, we clearly guide that those patients if you have two of those risk factors, you're more likely to fail.

 

We guide that, and that's exactly what we saw in the ATHENA study in terms of the characteristics of those that failed.

And it was in proportion with what we saw in the clinical study, which is obviously less than 1%.

 

So, no surprises whatsoever.

Exactly what you would expect.

 

And it just makes it more important that we continue to communicate through our sort of multivariate analysis data for whom Cabenuva is right and who probably shouldn't be taking the medicine.

But it's a tiny proportion of the overall patient base that will get benefit from this medicine.

 



Emma Walmsley

And nothing new.

 

Luke?



Luke Miels

Sure.

 

Thanks, Andrew.

I mean, as I said at Q2 that the exposure is US$700 million.

 

But of course, we've had notice.

So, we've got authorized generics in place.

 

We've done some withdrawals that we've announced.

We've done WAC adjustment with Lamictal.

 

The other products impacted, of course, are Advair and Flovent and Serevent.

Look, I think the impact is going to be sizable.

 

We've started to reflect that in RAR adjustments now, but we need to judge to see what level of returns ultimately come back.

There's also some variables in terms of the percentage of switch to authorized generics, but we do have competitive generics, for example, with Flovent, so they may pick up more volume, making it a bit hard to forecast.

 

So, long story short, I mean, we've been prepared for this.

We've been working on it for a couple of years.

 

I think we're in the strongest position possible.

But there is going to be a material impact on that US$700 million, and that's why it's reflected in the outlook for General Medicines next year.

 



Emma Walmsley

I mean, that's the really important point, is it's a '24 hit, but it's all included in our medium-term guidance of being broadly flat in this business, where we've obviously seen a nice uptick in performance, not least as Trelegy continues to power forward and lead the way.

 

So, all factored in and planned for.

Next question, please.

 



Nick Stone

So, next question is going to be from Richard Parkes at BNP Paribas.

 

Richard, over to you, please.



Emma Walmsley

Hi, Richard.

 



Richard Parkes

Thanks, Nick.

 

Yeah, just a couple of questions.

Firstly, on Arexvy.

 

Can you talk about the unmet need in terms of severe disease in the 50-year-old to 60-year-old patient population just so that we can get a sense of -- and also kind of what you would expect in terms of ACIP recommendations, so we can get a sense of how that label update might impact the opportunity going into next year?

And then, second question is on Jemperli.

 

Just wondered if you could talk about your confidence in expanding the approval into the MMR proficient population.

Obviously, I think there's sort of two options there.

 

One is the overall survival data from Part 1 of the study.

So, maybe you could talk about consistency of that benefit across those subgroups?

 

And then, the PARP inhibitor arm of Part 2 of the trial, I noticed you don't include [Zejula] (ph) when you talk about Part 2 as an opportunity.

So, I just wondered about your confidence in the PARP inhibitor maintenance arm of that study as well.

 

Thank you.



Emma Walmsley

Thanks.

 

Well, we'll come to Tony in a minute on oncology, but perhaps, Luke, you can talk about the 50-year-olds to 59-year-olds opportunity, which is another 40 million people, by the way, in the US alone.

So...

 



Luke Miels

Yeah.

 

I mean, I think there's two advantages.

One is just the 40 -- access to the 40 million people.

 

And again, that lines up nicely with the overall Shingrix cohort.

So, there's lots of synergies there we can achieve.

 

And then, there's the broader advantage when we're contracting in the retail and non-retail settings, because we'll be the only one there.

Our expectation at this point is it's going to be shared clinical decision making, but as we speculated before the launch and I think so far that's holding up, that's not been a barrier during this initial phase of adoption.

 

If you look at that 50-year-old to 60-year-old-plus population, there's a sizeable proportion of them that also have one or more comorbidities.

So, it's attractive, and certainly it resonates well with primary care doctors in terms of their support for the brand, which is around 71% in terms of their preference overall for Arexvy.

 



Emma Walmsley

Right.

 



Tony Wood

Okay.

 

In terms then of RUBY, particularly RUBY Part 2, just -- and indeed the MMRp population from the results that we described earlier this week, important to recognize that the RUBY Part 1 study was not powered to look at OS in the MMRp population, but rather OS for the overall population.

The way to think about this in context of both Part 1 and Part 2 is definitely isolating out the MMRp population, asking under what circumstances are we likely to see the most meaningful therapeutic effect for those.

 

There are, for example, genotype considerations associated with PARP response in the Part 2 population that are important.

I don't want to get caught on the details of those at this point in time.

 

We're still waiting for the readouts, but it's fair to say that the filing strategy that we'll put around Jemperli in first-line EC will take account of all of the factors that I just described as well as the competitive position.



Luke Miels

Yeah.

 

I think to build on that competitive position, I mean, I think we're optimistic in terms of how the NCCN may read that.

Of course, as you know, GY018 is not designed around an overall survival signal.

 

And it's very interesting, since that initial label, we've gone from 300 to 900 accounts now stocking Jemperli in the US.

So that has a flow-on effect and sales are up 10 times after SGO.

 

And it's intriguing just looking at the marketing shares.

If you look at that first-line setting where that was obviously non-promoted initially, I mean, Keytruda was picking up around 40% of that business.

 

[Chemo] (ph) had dropped from 40% down to 27%.

And we had around 13% of that market.

 

So, I think there's an opportunity now to start to make the case versus GY018, the elements of design and the survival signal to try and expand the usage of Jemperli in that setting.

So that's something we're quite excited about.

 

And then of course, DUO-E helps inform the thinking around RUBY, too.



Tony Wood

Exactly.

 

Just a couple of things to underscore to Luke's point to remind you about GY018, different patient population.

We had a larger degree of carcinosarcoma patients which are harder to treat, and importantly as well the resist sampling frequency for our study was smaller, which obviously is going to pick up failures more quickly than the GY018 case does.

 

So, important to bear those two things in mind when you consider the comparison of the two studies.

And Luke, I think, has guided you correctly in thinking about DUO-E as being informative with regards to how we might interpret the Part 2.

 



Emma Walmsley

Thank you.

 

Next question.



Nick Stone

So, next question is from James Gordon at JPMorgan.

 



James Gordon

Hello.

 

James Gordon, JPMorgan.

Thanks for taking the questions.

 

And I'm going to stick to Arexvy for my two.

The first one was about Arexvy and stocking.

 

So, it looks like about £460 million of Arexvy was stock in this quarter.

And the guide for this year implies about £200 million to £300 million of sales in Q4.

 

But what does this assume in terms of stocking unwind in Q4?

How much stock do you need to keep in the market to support the product as an ongoing run rate?

 

And also, what are you thinking about ex-US stocking in Q4?

Could there be a US-sized stock up that we saw in Q3 in Q4?

 

And the second question sort of leads into that, which is Arexvy and the ex-US launch.

So, ex-US sales, I think, were only £9 million this quarter, but the product was approved in the EU back in June.

 

And my understanding is you're not capacity constrained.

So, could ex-US start to ramp in Q4 this year?

 

And looking into next year, could we see a big launch for ex-US Arexvy?

Could that be a big growth driver for next year?

 

Or is it going to take a bit longer in Europe to get this going?

And what are the gating factors to get ex-US Arexvy ramping like what we've seen this quarter in the US?

 



Emma Walmsley

Okay.

 

Well, we'll go to Julie first just to deconstruct the guidance for Q4, and then Luke around the globalization.

But you're absolutely right, this is a global opportunity.

 

And I'll even include in that, the recent commercial deals we've been doing in second biggest market in the world, which would be an option on that for the future.

And just to repeat, we're very ambitious for this being a multi-billion asset, as we've committed before.

 

But in terms of the very short term, in its first season, Julie, do you want to comment on the guidance ahead?



Julie Brown

Yes, thanks very much, Emma.

 

So, what we've definitely found so far is of the sales of £709 million, in terms of immunizations into people's arms, we've got around equivalent of about £230 million to £250 million.

We were expecting -- I mean, the launch has been massively successful.

 

We were expecting a stock in at this point, because it's very, very analogous to what's happening with flu.

So, I think I'll hand over to Luke in terms of the amount of inventory we expect to carry.

 

Your figure for Q4, by the way, was absolutely spot on in terms of the level of sales we expect to see in the remainder £200 million to £300 million.

And it's all to do with the stocking.

 

So, over to Luke.



Luke Miels

Yeah.

 

I mean, if you look at the total market, I think it's about [US$2.71 billion] (ph).

And we've got [US$1.7 billion] (ph) of that in arm.

 

Yeah, I won't give too much more color.

I mean, as Julie said, it's two-thirds of sales so far.

 

And we'll obviously try and burn through that towards the end of the year to position ourselves well.

What we don't want is empty shelves or any window that Pfizer can get in there.

 

That's why I'm being a little bit cute with the numbers here because it's very dynamic at this point.

In terms of EU, look, it's very early days.

 

It's private.

We've kept the price in a very tight collar with the US like we've done with Shingrix.

 

And our expectation is that we need to now navigate access.

We've got early wins in Canada.

 

We've got some very encouraging signs coming in Europe and other markets.

So, we'll see the full effect of that in 2024.

 

And of course, the advantage in the European markets like Japan and other international markets is once we get the NIP, then the level of resourcing we need to do to drive patients is significantly lower.

And so, from a P&L point of view, it's also very attractive.

 

So, 2024 for rest of world for Arexvy and good start in the US.



Emma Walmsley

And just to repeat, we are definitely seeing increased openness and recognition of the value, literally financial value of investing in prevention.

 

And so that is and definitely a part why we're seeing this faster rate, even if it's currently in the private market of approvals, because it's just a lot cheaper and there isn't a healthcare system or budget that isn't burdened at the moment, and they have more infrastructure in place, not least through pharmacy channels for distribution in many countries.

So, all of this underpins this broader confidence but with phenomenally tight discipline from Luke and his team as he's alluded to around the shape of the financial contribution plan.

 

Next question, please.



Nick Stone

So, mindful, we're at just over the hour mark, and we've still got six individuals with hands raised.

 

So what I propose is that we try and work through as many of those as possible till quarter past the hour, and then we'll close the call there.

So, our next question comes from Mark Purcell at Morgan Stanley.

 

Over to you, Mark.



Mark Purcell

Yeah.

 

Thank you, Nick, and thanks for taking my question.

On Arexvy, a little bit more color.

 

I just wondered if there's any early indications of outer seasonal demand for RSV vaccination.

Still there may be more of a sort of Prevnar flu hybrid model.

 

I know you'll know more by the end of the year, but any early indications there?

And in pharmacies where Pfizer is fully stocked alongside you, given they talk about how they're not fully launched yet, what is your market share in those pharmacies where both products are present?

 

And then a quick one for Tony.

In terms of the Inflation Reduction Act considerations on R&D, where you have assets such as your IL-18 where you could run parallel trials across a multiple number of indications, do you see the sort of pressure to do that?

 

And on something like IL-5, could you do a bridge study or would you have to do a separate study in COPD?



Emma Walmsley

Okay.

 

Luke and Tony?



Luke Miels

Yeah.

 

Thanks, Mark.

We're beating them everywhere so far.

 

The aim is to keep that happening.

So yeah, I mean -- look, it's really it's interesting.

 

I mean, when you look at pharmacists' prioritization, RSV is up there with flu and COVID.

You've seen COVID volumes drop off.

 

And, last week, we still kept growing with Arexvy, which is encouraging.

I was sort of wondering whether it would start to slow down.

 

So, this next couple of weeks, script data will really be interesting.

It's more than 90% in the retail setting.

 

And that's another critical component in your assumptions.

And we don't actually expect that to materially change.

 

We think vaccines for maternal in OBGYN and PCP offices will occur, which will be something we'll have to back out in future calculations, but we think the older adults market is going to be very much like flu, very much like Shingrix heading in the direction of retail.

So, we'll just see what people's enthusiasm is over the next couple of weeks.

 

Clearly, awareness is very high.

Intention to recommend is very high.

 

So again, I'm very happy to sort of back the truck up with everything that we know in Q4 and give you much more color around the market research that we'll have at that point.



Emma Walmsley

Great, thanks.

 

And Tony, anything to add?



Tony Wood

Yeah.

 

Just two very quick ones in terms of the IL-18 question.

Look, the key question you're asking with IL-18 at the moment is its efficacy relative to [depe] (ph) in atopic dermatitis.

 

For the medium term, as we build out our biomarker strategy and look for markers of efficacy at Phase I, that's exactly the underpinnings that I would then want to have the confidence to go forward into multiple indications.

You probably have in mind that in the case of IL-18, the Mendelian randomization also points to inflammatory bowel disease, obviously a range of other considerations there beyond just IRA in terms of whether or not that's a path to go.

 

And then lastly for MATINEE and the bridge for depe, let's see where we go when we get the MATINEE results.

Obviously, we're focusing very much on the role of EOS in driving the morbidity and mortality associated with COPD.

 

So, that will be part of our strategy, but I'm focused at the moment on making sure we get the results out for MATINEE and delivering a success.

Emma, any color to that?

 



Emma Walmsley

Yeah.

 

Of course any allocation of capital is a combination of probability of success and the assumed forecast.

And that assumed forecast now has to take into account the area under the curve, what they really like, format or anything else.

 

Next question, please.



Nick Stone

Next question is from Steve Scala at TD Cowen.

 

Over to you, Steve.



Steve Scala

Thank you very much.

 

I'm just curious of Arexvy shipments in October support your conservative guide for the full year.

So, were they essentially zero?

 

I would note that in the first quarter of 2018, GSK called out stocking for Shingrix and then went on to beat in 10 of the next 12 quarters in the US.

Second, I know you're beating Pfizer in RSV everywhere, but to what should we attribute the success they have had?

 

Previously, you've said that you have a better vaccine, you're stronger in the commercial setting, yet they put up a big number as well.

So, to what do we attribute that?

 

Thank you.



Emma Walmsley

Well, I'll ask Luke to overlay, Steve, but thanks for the questions.

 

And this is the first season that we've been through.

We've given our guide for the reasons that I won't repeat since we're under some timing pressure, but we will know a lot more in Q4.

 

And obviously, we remain extremely ambitious for this.

And our competitive focus is to make sure that not only the size of the market is big, which is where we welcome competition, but that we are able to effectively reach the patients that need us, which is this more vulnerable [indiscernible] cohort.

 

Luke, anything you want to add?



Luke Miels

Yeah.

 

Look, I think Shingrix is a different case, right?

I mean, I was in the middle of that, we canceled the global launch.

 

We redirected all of the volumes to the US.

And we also in the middle of the later year had some synergies in manufacturing, which were surprising upside in terms of loss rate and packaging.

 

So that's why we're able to get that volume ahead for Shingrix.

Look, I think in terms of us versus Pfizer, firstly, it's great two companies are out there driving volume because this is an awareness game.

 

No one had heard of RSV if you're a person in the population before that.

So, having two companies promote, it's good.

 

We have enormous respect for Pfizer.

We like competing with them.

 

They are a strategic competitor for us if you look across PCV, meningitis, RSV and potentially shingles at some point.

So, it's nice to have this strong start.

 

And again, yeah, we want to keep this going.



Emma Walmsley

Next question.

 



Nick Stone

Yeah.

 

Next question is from Peter Welford at Jefferies.



Peter Welford

Hi, thanks.

 

Yeah, I'm afraid I'm sticking with Arexvy.

Can I just ask quickly, you mentioned that retail was over 90% of the volumes so far.

 

Curious, why you're so confident that, that mix will continue?

I mean obviously Shingrix, it's varied over time.

 

But I think your competitor made some comments that they think potentially in the fourth quarter and the back half of the season, it's going to switch more towards the non-retail segment where they see perhaps a greater competitive advantage.

I wonder if you could comment I guess on both of those, both from the competitive advantage point of view and also how potentially this could change I guess during the course of the season?

 

And then just secondly, I wanted to stick with vaccines, but wondering if Tony could possibly give us an update at all on how you're thinking about mRNA.

I know we come back to this almost every quarter.

 

There obviously have been some competitive developments in there.

So, I wonder if you could just give us a quick update on how you're looking at your strategy and updates from news flow we could get for your mRNA portfolio in 2024?

 



Emma Walmsley

Yeah, we're very excited about mRNA.

 

So, I'm going to come to Tony first.

And remember the 90% is all the rest of adult, but we'll come back on that to Luke in a minute.

 

But Tony, mRNA.



Tony Wood

Yeah.

 

So, just very quickly then, very pleased about the platform and how it's moving forward.

We're now moving into Phase II in both COVID and flu.

 

And Phase II program for flu is -- includes a range of options and doses that we've deduced from our Phase I study, looking at up to 8 antigen components, which we feel is the path forward to, I presume, resolving the B strain coverage question that exists.

Also worthwhile pointing out that, that's likely to become a slightly simplified proposition as the B/Yamagata strain is probably going to be removed in '24.

 

But more on this when I've got the readout from the Phase II data.



Emma Walmsley

Luke, anything you want to add on that?

 



Luke Miels

Yeah, Peter, I mean, I just sort of look at it at a macro level.

 

You've got 83 million who are over 60-years-old, you add the 50-59-year-olds, that's another 40 million, so that's 120 million.

We think 90% of those are going to still come through.

 

If you look at a typical birth cohort, it's 4 million a year.

So, if I look at between now and the end of the year, that's about 1 million pregnant women.

 

And then, it's unknown how many of those will get a vaccine.

There's the influence, the availability of the antibody as well.

 

I think the other thing to keep in mind, and we're seeing this with Shingrix, is there are a lot of practices that are driving patients to pharmacy because they are -- they don't want to navigate the IRA dimensions and then have a separate track for the commercial patients.

So, they're actually sending patients through to the pharmacy rather than sort of persisting with that themselves.

 

So that's a bit unknown, but definitely those maternal vaccines will be given at OBGYN offices where you don't have the label there.

So, we'll need to exclude that from our market share calculations going forward.

 



Emma Walmsley

Thank you.

 

We've got time for...



Nick Stone

We do have time for one more.

 

So apologies to those of you that we won't get to, but our last question comes from Emily Field at Barclay.

So, Emily, over to you.

 



Emily Field

Oh, thank you so much for fitting me in.

 

And maybe I'll just ask one last one about Ojjaara.

I was wondering if you could provide some context about how you're thinking of speed of uptake of this launch, particularly now that you did get the line-agnostic label?

 

And if you're expecting more sort of upfront usage for just second-line usage?

And any early indicators you could give us?

 

Thank you.



Emma Walmsley

Luke, straight to you.

 



Luke Miels

Sure.

 

Thanks, Emily.

So first, we've got about 172 patients on so far.

 

The bulk of those are sort of jacked failures, highly anemic, so pretty severe cases.

So that initial bolus, I think, we'll work through.

 

Our working assumption is that between 40% and 50% of patients presenting are anemic at diagnosis.

And as you know, we've got an outstanding recommendation there in terms of 2a and the most competitive profile on that subgroup.

 

And we also know that around 46% of patients require a transfusion within one year of diagnosis.

So that's our target.

 

That's our target market.

We think right now, yeah, third-line, it's a couple of months, but we'll work our way up.

 

Second-line, typical treatment length is 18 months, but we should be able to start to penetrate in 2024, that first-line where typical treatments around 26 months of duration.

And we got the NCCN data into them two hours within an approval and we were very happy with the recommendation.

 

So, so far so good.

A lot of academic interest.

 

That's about 55% of the volume right now, 45% in the community.

Of course, we expect that to change in time.

 

But yeah, a lot of excitement and this is clearly a visible problem for haematologists.

And yeah, they're very supportive of momelotinib.

 

So, so far, so good.



Emma Walmsley

Wonderful.

 

Thanks, Luke.

Well, look forward to coming back to more of your questions over coming days and weeks.

 

I just want to leave you with the recap that we are delivering strong and sustained performance momentum with another quarter of double-digit sales and earnings growth.

This is broadly based performance, but of course benefiting specifically from the very fast start of Arexvy, which we're looking forward to seeing its progress ahead.

 

I'm pleased to have an upgrade, but also really delighted with the momentum as we look ahead to delivering our '26 results and continuing to strengthen that longer-term outlook as we keep progressing the vaccines pipeline, longer-acting HIV and exciting prospects in respiratory.

So, thank you to everybody.

 

We look forward to catching up soon.","Operator

Good morning.

 

My name is Kevin.

And welcome to Moderna's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call.

 

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.

Following the formal remarks, we'll open the call up for your questions.

 

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised, today's call is being recorded.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Lavina Talukdar, Head of Investor Relations at Moderna.

 

Please proceed.



Lavina Talukdar

Thank you, Kevin.

 

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Moderna's third quarter 2023 financial results and business updates.

You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we'll be reviewing by going to the Investors section of our website.

 

On today's call are Stéphane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; Arpa Garay, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Jamey Mock, our Chief Financial Officer.

Before we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

 

Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.

With that, I'll turn it over to Stéphane.

 



Stéphane Bancel

Thank you, Lavina.

 

Good morning or good afternoon, everyone.

Thank you for joining us today.

 

I will start with a quick review of our business for third quarter.

Arpa will then give you an update of our commercial progress and plans.

 

Jamey will present our financial results and will explain in detail the one-time charges we announced this morning in our press release.

Stephen will then review our clinical programs.

 

And I will share our key priorities for 2024 and 2025 to return Moderna to sales growth and profitability.

We delivered $1.8 billion in Spikevax sales of COVID vaccine in the third quarter.

 

Based on trend we are seeing in the U.S.

COVID market in recent weeks, we expect our sales for 2023 to be at least $6 billion.

 

We have been preparing for the 2023 fall COVID launch throughout the year, because the U.S.

market was pivoting from a pandemic government purchase market to a commercial market.

 

I am very pleased to report that according to IQVIA market data, we have a market share in the U.S.

of 45% season to date, compared to 36% for 2022.

 

[And Arpa] (ph) will show you, we even achieved 51% market share last week in the U.S.

This commercial performance in the U.S.

 

market shows that Moderna can compete commercially with large established players, [that will prove] (ph) important as we launch RSV 2024 and combo of flu-COVID in 2025.

On the cost side of the company, we informed you at R&D Day that it was important for us to resize our manufacturing footprint as the world has moved from a pandemic to an endemic setting.

 

I am pleased that our manufacturing and finance team were able to move fast and resize our manufacturing, so that we can go back to 75% to 80% gross margin levels.

This resizing resulted in a charge of $1.6 billion, which Jamey will explain in detail in his section.

 

Now let me turn over to Arpa to walk you through our progress in the U.S.

market.

 



Arpa Garay

Thank you, Stéphane, and good morning or good afternoon to everyone.

 

Today, I will provide an update on our third quarter performance, our U.S.

commercial launch progress and our preparation for our RSV launch next year.

 

Our total sales in the third quarter came in at $1.8 billion, which includes approximately $800 million in international sales and $900 million in U.S.

sales.

 

Total sales for the first three quarters of the year were $3.9 billion.

Turning now to our expectations for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 outlook.

 

In our international business, we expect an additional $1.1 billion in sales.

These sales are based on government contracts and once vaccine doses are shipped and accepted by the customer, they are not returnable.

 

More than half of these sales have already shipped in the fourth quarter.

In the U.S., we expect at least $1 billion in sales in the fourth quarter, which would bring U.S.

 

sales to approximately $2 billion for the second half of 2023.

This assumes approximately 50 million doses administered in the U.S., which would be similar to the fall season of 2022.

 

With $3.9 billion in sales recorded as of the end of the third quarter, expected fourth quarter sales of $1.1 billion internationally and at least $1 billion in the U.S., our updated sales outlook for 2023 is at least $6 billion.

Now turning to the U.S.

 

launch.

The data shown here are from IQVIA.

 

As a reminder, IQVIA data only captures the retail channel in the U.S., which includes retail pharmacies and long-term care.

I'm first going to share what our weekly market share trends look like and then discuss our cumulative share since launch and how it compares to last year.

 

On the fifth week post launch, for the week ending October 20th, what you can see on the slide here is that Moderna's market share is 51%.

As we look over the season to date, Moderna's cumulative market share for this season is now 45%, which is higher than the 36% market share we had in 2022.

 

As Stéphane mentioned, this progress demonstrates our ability to compete effectively in the commercial endemic market.

Turning now to Slide 8, which shows cumulative vaccinations in the U.S.

 

retail pharmacy channel.

This year, COVID vaccines were launched two weeks later than in 2022.

 

As a result, we analyze the data on a launch-adjusted basis as shown in the graph on the slide.

To do this, we look at the data based on the number of weeks post launch rather than simply on a calendar basis.

 

This helps us compare vaccines uptake in 2023 versus 2022.

On the graph, the blue line represents cumulative vaccinations post launch in '22 and the red line represents cumulative vaccination post launch this year.

 

And on a launch-adjusted basis, the total market is tracking ahead of last year's vaccination levels, both on a weekly basis but also on a cumulative basis.

As a reminder, the retail channel is typically the largest segment, so these trends in the first five weeks are encouraging given the later launch and slightly shorter season in 2023.

 

Let's now turn to look at the channel mix in the market on Slide 9.

In 2023, we expect retail and non-retail mix to evolve as the season progresses.

 

The non-retail segment includes independent networks, health systems, U.S.

government entities, clinics, and other providers.

 

Last year, this non-retail segment made up approximately 16 million doses in the season, or 33% of the total market.

The gray line on the graph charts CDC-reported vaccinations, which capture both retail and non-retail channels in 2022.

 

The blue line is vaccinations at retail pharmacies, as reported by IQVIA, in 2022.

The difference between these two lines represents the non-retail segment.

 

Looking at the data on the graph, you can see that the retail channel captures the majority of vaccinations early in the season.

This can be seen in the narrow spread between the CDC and IQVIA data represented by the gray and blue lines, respectively.

 

Now, if you look in the seventh week of launch in 2022, the current week that we are in, in '23, you can see that the slope of the non-retail channel is increasing.

We know that distributors this year have recently increased shipments to the non-retail channel and, as such, we expect non-retail as a percentage of market to grow between now and year-end.

 

Importantly, we expect our market share to be consistent across channels and higher in 2023 than in 2022.

We are committed to focus on public health efforts to increase vaccination rates.

 

In the United States, we are taking a multi-pronged approach to educate all stakeholders and increase the urgency to get vaccinated.

Across the medical community, pharmacies and clinics, and advocacy groups, we are providing patient education resources to help our partners encourage their patients to get their COVID vaccine this fall.

 

Earlier this week, we also launched our branded direct-to-consumer campaign, both on TV as well as across digital channels.

For the remainder of the year, we will be amplifying education on the need for vaccination prior to gatherings, particularly with at-risk populations such as families, and traveling during the holiday season.

 

We are also launching a focused education effort for consumers who are infected with COVID this summer on the importance of getting vaccinated in November and December.

To summarize our COVID outlook, we expect at least $6 billion of sales this year based on the U.S.

 

vaccination trends that signal a market of at least 50 million doses.

Moderna's share, both in retail and non-retail, is expected to be consistent across channels and higher than in 2022.

 

Vaccine administrations in the retail channel are tracking ahead of last year on a launch-adjusted basis, signaling strong early consumer demand.

Last year, only about 55% of COVID vaccinations were given by the end of October, with an additional 23 million vaccinations given in November and December.

 

We expect the non-retail channel to increase as a percentage of the market, which will provide additional sites of vaccination for consumers to allow for a strong November and December.

This year, given the later launch of vaccines, the non-retail channels are just now beginning their vaccination campaigns.

 

To continue the momentum from our launch and supplement our customers' efforts, we will be amplifying our marketing campaigns in November and December.

Let me now turn to the upcoming RSV launch in 2024.

 

We believe we have a best-in-class product profile that can make a difference both to patients but also to our customers.

Our clinical profile shows strong vaccine efficacy.

 

We have a well-established safety and tolerability profile that leverages the same mRNA technology that has been delivered in over 1 billion COVID vaccines.

Additionally, we have not seen any cases of GBS in our Phase 3 trials.

 

An important differentiator for our customers is that we will be the only company with ready-to-use pre-filled syringes, which are preferred by pharmacists and by clinicians.

We continue to expect a 2024 launch of our RSV vaccine in the U.S., and are also preparing for launches in several international markets.

 

We're encouraged by the recent RSV launches in the market this year, beating expectations due to robust consumer awareness and demand.

And we believe that we are well positioned for our launch in 2024.

 

Our strong clinical profile and ready-to-use pre-filled syringes are key competitive differentiators.

My team and I are particularly excited about our ready-to-use pre-filled syringes given the robust demand for our COVID pre-filled syringes this fall.

 

The majority of RSV vaccines in the U.S.

will be given in the pharmacy setting.

 

And given the ongoing pharmacy labor shortages, our ready-to-use presentation will save time and also reduce administration errors.

We will be the only company with a one-step administration compared to competitive products, which require multiple preparation steps by pharmacists and clinicians.

 

We are very excited for the launch of our RSV vaccine given the strong product profile.

And the commercial team is well positioned to bring our RSV vaccine, our second respiratory vaccine, to market.

 

I will now turn it over to Jamey to provide an update on our financials.



Jamey Mock

Thanks, Arpa, and hello, everyone.

 

Today, I will review our financial performance for the third quarter and provide an updated framework for our full year 2023 financial outlook.

Additionally, given we know it's top of mind for investors, we wanted to provide our early thoughts on 2024 and how we're approaching the next couple years.

 

Starting on Slide 15.

Total net product sales for the quarter were $1.8 billion, down 44% year-over-year, driven by lower sales volume, and partially offset by a higher average selling price.

 

Product sales were almost evenly distributed between the U.S.

market and the rest of the world.

 

We initiated product shipments to customers in mid-September for the fall booster season, following the authorization of our updated COVID-19 vaccine.

Cost of sales for the third quarter of 2023 was $2.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year.

 

I will provide detailed commentary on the following slides.

Research and development expenses were $1.2 billion, which increased by 41% versus the prior year.

 

This increase was driven by our expanded and maturing development pipeline with six products now in Phase 3 studies or pending approval.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $442 million, reflecting an increase of 59% year-over-year.

 

The growth in spending was primarily driven by the buildout of our commercial activities and, in particular, our launch in the U.S.

commercial market.

 

The income tax provision in Q3 was $1.7 billion, as we reported evaluation allowance against deferred tax assets of $1.7 billion.

Under GAAP accounting rules, we are required to take a reserve, also referred to as evaluation allowance, for deferred tax assets when the current year and cumulative income projection for the next three years is in a loss position.

 

These losses indicate our deferred tax assets may not be fully realized.

It's important to note, future income from products not yet approved by regulators are excluded from these income projections, which restricts us to adjust our COVID vaccine, and it does not include expected future launches.

 

In combination with our updated endemic COVID forecast, we determined it was appropriate to record a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets.

This valuation allowance did not impact cash flows, nor future returns, nor the company's ability to utilize deferred tax assets in future periods.

 

Net loss for the period was $3.6 billion compared to net income of $1 billion last year.

Diluted loss per share was $9.53 compared to diluted earnings per share of $2.53 in 2022.

 

Finally, we ended the third quarter with $12.8 billion in cash and investments.

The decline versus prior quarter was driven by our operating loss and sales to be collected in Q4.

 

Now, let me come back to cost of sales on Slide 16.

We now expect full year cost of sales of $5 billion, driven by $1.5 billion of unit-driven expenses, which also includes royalties, and $3.5 billion of inventory write-downs and charges related to CMO purchase commitments, cancellation fees, and wind-down costs.

 

As Stéphane previously highlighted, in our pursuit to optimize the cost structure of our COVID-19 franchise, we undertook a strategic initiative in the third quarter to restructure our manufacturing footprint, which was built for the pandemic.

As part of this initiative, we reduced our capacity and commitments with several third-party vendors, we reevaluated our raw material inventory levels, and cut back on our purchase commitments for raw materials not anticipated to be consumed before expiration.

 

As a result, we are recording charges of $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion of which are in Q3 and an expected $0.2 billion in Q4.

The $1.4 billion charge in Q3 consists of inventory write-downs of $0.9 billion and CMO wind-down costs and cancellation fees of $0.5 billion.

 

The Q4 charge is related to CMO wind-down costs.

Despite the immediate financial impact, we are confident that this strategic move will improve the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and establish a strong foundation for improved margins going forward.

 

As part of the $1.6 billion in total restructuring charges I just mentioned, only the CMO-related costs and cancellation fees are cash restructuring costs.

We project this approximately $0.7 billion charge will have a payback in less than two years and a net cash benefit of approximately $1 billion through 2029.

 

As I mentioned, our full year forecast for cost of sales in 2023 is now $5 billion.

Before resizing charges of $1.6 billion, our cost of sales for the full year is expected to be at the low end of our previous guidance of $3.5 billion to $4 billion.

 

So, now coming back to my commentary on Q3.

In addition to unit-driven manufacturing costs and the cost from this initiative, we also incurred approximately $0.4 billion of inventory charges for excess and obsolete material, demand-related write-downs of our latest Spikevax product, and unutilized manufacturing capacity charges.

 

Moving to Slide 17.

In summary, we made substantial progress to resize our COVID cost structure and accelerated our path towards our longer-term target of 20% to 25% of sales.

 

We expect our cost of sales to not only be at a lower level, but also be more predictable in the future.

In recent quarters, our cost of sales were highly impacted by write-offs and charges as we just addressed today and in previous calls.

 

Year-to-date write-offs and charges for inventory CMO and supplier-related commitments are 74% of sales.

Starting in 2024, we expect those to be less than 10% of sales on an annualized basis.

 

Our capacity is now better positioned to scale with volume.

At a $4 billion sales level, we expect cost of sales of approximately 35%, reducing to approximately 30% at $6 billion of sales, and 20% to 25% at even higher sales levels.

 

In other words, with our resized manufacturing footprint, we now expect to achieve significant volume leverage moving forward.

Let's now move to Slide 18.

 

While we intend to continue to focus on GAAP results, we wanted to give you a view of our financial results in Q3 with and without the resizing and tax valuation allowance charges.

While our total GAAP net loss in the third quarter was $3.6 billion, our loss excluding these charges would have been $0.5 billion.

 

Now, let's turn to our updated 2023 financial framework on Slide 19.

As Arpa mentioned earlier, we now expect product sales for 2023 of at least $6 billion for the full year, which is comprised of $3.9 billion of sales through the third quarter, an additional $1.1 billion of international sales in Q4, and at least $1 billion of Q4 sales from the U.S.

 

As explained earlier, we now expect cost of sales for the full year of approximately $5 billion, which includes resizing charges of $1.6 billion.

For R&D and SG&A, we now expect full year expenses to be approximately $6.3 billion, with approximately $4.8 billion in research and development.

 

Our R&D spend is slightly higher than the $4.5 billion previously forecasted, which is mainly driven by business development activities as well as additional investments in our late-stage clinical trials.

Our forecast for SG&A expenses remain consistent at approximately $1.5 billion.

 

We now expect a full year tax expense of approximately $0.8 billion to $1 billion, driven by the $1.7 billion increase in the deferred tax allowance I referenced earlier.

And finally, we now expect capital expenditures of approximately $0.9 billion, down from our previous guidance of $1 billion.

 

Before I get into the specifics on 2024 and 2025, I wanted to share with you our principles on how we are operating the company today and our plans over the next three years.

We are laser-focused on making our COVID franchise profitable in 2024 and beyond.

 

We look at our Spikevax product profitability, excluding research and development costs, for our future pipeline, and we believe our recent resizing efforts will ensure that our COVID franchise is a continuous and increasing source of income and cash generation.

At the same time, we also recognize the significant and unique opportunity for organic sales growth ahead of us with our late-stage pipeline.

 

We will be disciplined in our investment approach and adjust R&D and SG&A based upon the sales performance of our product lines, which in 2024 is still mostly COVID, but we expect it to also include RSV.

We expect this investment in our late-stage pipeline will result in a loss over the next two years, but help us to breakeven starting in 2026.

 

We believe our current balance sheet is more than sufficient to fund our plans without the need to raise equity.

We are also not planning to repurchase shares in the intermediate term.

 

Stepping back, we believe this is an unparalleled opportunity to impact the lives of patients while creating shareholder value at the same time.

Moving to Slide 21, let's start with our view on sales over the next couple of years.

 

We're expecting sales to hit a low point in 2024 at approximately $4 billion.

The biggest change year-over-year is related to our signed APAs.

 

We currently have $1 billion of COVID-related APAs for delivery in 2024.

Recall that our first half sales in 2023 of $2.1 billion were mostly deferrals from our 2022 existing contracts.

 

So, we expect minimal sales in the first half of 2024.

For the U.S., we expect 2024 to be at least $2 billion and believe it will grow over time.

 

Lastly, we expect approximately $1 billion from RSV and other international COVID sales.

And finally, in 2025, we expect a return to growth.

 

Let me finish by giving you a more fulsome view on 2024 and our thinking on 2025.

Starting with 2024, as I just explained, we expect sales to be approximately $4 billion.

 

Cost of sales are expected to be approximately 35% of sales.

R&D expenses of approximately $4.5 billion in 2024, would be down 6%.

 

In 2024, the majority of our R&D expenses are for registration trials, which are now mostly committed.

I will speak to our view on 2025 R&D expenses in a moment.

 

SG&A expenses of approximately $1.3 billion in 2024 would be down 13%.

We expect taxes to be negligible in 2024 and capital expenditures to be similar to 2023 at $0.9 billion.

 

In summary for 2024, Spikevax will generate nearly $1 billion of income.

When we combine that with our estimated investments in R&D and capital expenditures, our cash balance is projected to be approximately $9 billion at the end of 2024.

 

Now for our preliminary thoughts on 2025.

As mentioned earlier, sales will return to growth.

 

Cost of sales will improve with the increased sales growth.

R&D will be flat to down, and we have much greater flexibility for reduction, given that only approximately half of our current R&D spending levels for registrational trials are committed for 2025.

 

SG&A will be flat to down.

Taxes will continue to be negligible.

 

And capital expenditures will be materially lower after the completion of our facilities in the UK, Canada and Australia in the first half of 2025.

In summary, our COVID operating income will grow and our investments will remain flat or lower, leading us to an estimated ending cash balance of approximately $6 billion to $7 billion in 2025.

 

Finally, during this period, we expect to launch five new products to help us breakeven in 2026.

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Stephen.

 



Stephen Hoge

Good morning or good afternoon.

 

Today I'll do a quick review of our clinical programs.

Many of the details from these programs were shared at our R&D Day in September.

 

I will also review the Phase 3 trial designs for our combination flu and COVID vaccine, mRNA-1083 and the Phase 3 trial design for our INT in non-small cell lung cancer.

During R&D Day, we shared the significant progress we've made through the year in advancing our late-stage pipeline, creating the opportunity to have up to 15 product launches in the next five years.

 

Through 2025, and subject to regulatory review and approvals, we anticipate launches for our RSV vaccine, our flu vaccine, a next-generation COVID vaccine, and our combination flu and COVID vaccine.

Looking beyond 2025, we have a diverse pipeline of other vaccines, cancer therapies, and rare metabolic disease medicines.

 

We're very excited by the potential benefits these medicines offer across a diverse range of therapeutic areas.

Slide 25 is an overview of our respiratory vaccines pipeline.

 

Our leading pipeline includes commercial and Phase 3 programs against COVID, RSV, and flu, as well as earlier-stage next-generation programs in COVID and flu and multiple [combinations] (ph).

We recently shared positive topline Phase 1/2 data from our combination flu and COVID vaccine, mRNA-1083.

 

And on the heels of this success, we've started and are rapidly enrolling a Phase 3 study for mRNA-1083 in adults 50 and older.

Slide 26 shows the Phase 3 design for mRNA-1083.

 

The Phase 3 study is a randomized, stratified, observer-blind, active-control study evaluating the immunogenicity and safety of 1083 compared to co-administered flu and COVID vaccines.

The study will enroll 8,000 participants overall, with two cohorts of 4,000 participants stratified by age 65 years and older and 50 to 64 years of age.

 

Both cohorts will receive mRNA-1083, or in the control arm, an age-recommended licensed quadrivalent flu vaccine plus our approved COVID vaccine.

Study participants will be followed for six months.

 

The next, on Slide 27, is an overview of our latent and other vaccines pipeline.

As previously announced, our Phase 3 study evaluating vaccine efficacy and safety of our CMV vaccine in women of childbearing age is now fully enrolled, including the adolescent cohort.

 

The study is accruing cases and we look forward to vaccine efficacy data when it becomes available.

Earlier-stage clinical programs against EBV, HIV, VZV, HSV, and against the Norovirus and Lyme disease continue to progress.

 

Slide 28 is an overview of our therapeutics pipeline.

We're proud of the progress across cancer, rare diseases, and other areas.

 

Many of the details of these programs were highlighted at our recent R&D Day, and I refer you to that presentation on our website.

Notable since R&D Day is the continued rapid enrollment of the INT Phase 3 adjuvant melanoma study, which has seen a great deal of interest from investigators and patients since presentation of the Phase 2 data at ASCO earlier this year.

 

As previously announced, before the end of the year, we will conduct another analysis of the Phase 2 study with longer follow-up time at approximately three years, and we are looking forward to sharing that data INT is also moving forward in other types of cancer with the initiation of a second Phase 3 study in adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer.

The Phase 3 design for adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer is shown on Slide 29.

 

It is a randomized placebo-blind -- double-blind placebo and active comparator controlled study of a combination of INT plus KEYTRUDA versus placebo plus KEYTRUDA in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

The study will enroll approximately 900 patients with stage II to IIIB tumors who were resected and previously treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.

 

Each patient will receive up to nine doses of INT administered intramuscularly every three weeks with KEYTRUDA administered every six weeks in the active arm, or nine doses of a placebo injection administered every three weeks and KEYTRUDA every six weeks in the comparator arm.

The primary endpoint of the study is disease-free survival.

 

Key secondary endpoints include overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and patient-reported outcomes.

This study marks an important milestone in our collaboration with our partner, Merck, and our shared commitment to rapidly bring INT to patients.

 

With that, I'll turn it over to Stéphane.



Stéphane Bancel

Thank you, Stephen, Jamey and Arpa.

 

Our focus is to return Moderna to sales growth and profitability.

To achieve that, we have three priorities.

 

Priority number one, commercial execution.

Our market share in the U.S.

 

demonstrates we can compete.

We are focused on launching RSV in 2024.

 

We believe we have best-in-class profile for RSV vaccine, high-efficiency, good safety profile, and the easiest to use in pharmacies or doctor's offices.

As you all know, pharmacy chains are having challenges given the workload, especially in the fall season.

 

The two other vaccines on the market today are very complicated to prepare before injection; one is nine steps, and one is four steps.

Now we launched pre-filled syringe and, as Arpa said, we are very excited about that.

 

And from the discussions I had with the leadership of pharmacies, I believe that this will be an important differentiation.

Our COVID plus flu combo vaccine should launch in 2025.

 

And as you know, flu is a higher volume market than COVID.

In the U.S., for example, flu is around 3 times the number of doses compared to the COVID market.

 

With these new product launches in '24 and '25, and the combination of COVID sales in the endemic setting, we believe Moderna will be in sales growth again in 2025.

Priority number two, discipline investments.

 

We'll be disciplined in our investments and [cycle] (ph) them based on our sales performance.

As you saw, we have taken bold actions to resize our manufacturing footprint in the third quarter.

 

The team is not done and there are many continuous improvement projects to drive a reduction in cost of manufacturing.

We'll also look at our R&D costs and will consider partnering some programs, if needed, to allow us to be responsible and disciplined about our costs.

 

For SG&A, as Jamey mentioned, we are currently going through our 2024 budget and our goal is to have a lower spend in SG&A in 2024 than we had in 2023.

We still plan to keep SG&A flat in 2025 versus 2024.

 

We're launching respiratory products in 2024 and 2025, and we anticipate the same teams [indiscernible] productivity gains as we improve our commercial operations.

As Jamey mentioned, we expect to breakeven in 2026.

 

Priority number three, executing on our late-stage pipeline to drive sales growth.

As you all know, we have an exciting late-stage pipeline with six Phase 3 assets.

 

For respiratory program, RSV, flu, next-gen COVID, mRNA-1283, and COVID plus flu combo that Stephen just talked about.

One latent program, CMV, which is fully enrolled in Phase 3 and accruing cases.

 

One oncology program, INT in melanoma, and as Stephen mentioned, in lung cancer.

We look forward to having and sharing three years of INT data from our melanoma study before the end of this year.

 

If the data are strong, we believe it could be the basis for regulatory discussions for potential accelerated approval.

We have been investing in building a factory in Marlborough, Massachusetts, which will enable the commercial launch for INT.

 

Thanks to the mRNA platform we built, we have an exciting pipeline, with up to 15 launches in the next five years.

We have the largest late-stage pipeline of any mRNA company in the world and will continue to focus to deliver the greatest possible impact to people for mRNA medicine.

 

I've never been more excited about the potential we have to deliver for patients.

The actions we are taking help us to execute on that vision.

 

With this, operator, we'll be happy to take questions now.
Operator

Thank you.

 

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gena Wang with Barclays.

Your line is open.

 



Gena Wang

Thank you for taking my questions.

 

I have two questions regarding the commercial questions.

First, you did mention 2026, you're looking to have a breakeven.

 

And when we take a quick look based on your 2024 and 2025 outlook, it seems the total cost could be in the $8 billion to $9 billion, that range.

Could you give us a sense what could be the additional sales if we're using 2024 guidance as a base point?

 

And the second very quickly regarding the manufacturing resizing.

After resizing, what is the full capacity regarding doses and what percentage of the manufacturing will be internal in 2024 and 2025?

 



Jamey Mock

Maybe I'll take the first one -- first part of the question.

 

So, in terms of 2026, and thanks for the question, let's talk to you about how we're thinking about it.

So, we mentioned $4 billion in 2024, approximately $4 billion.

 

And this is all about our late-stage pipeline coming to fruition.

So, in 2024, we'll launch RSV, but it's mostly kind of in the second half year sales, and then we'll have a full year in 2025, so that'll provide growth.

 

We will also come to market with flu in 2025.

We'll also come to market with a combination of flu and COVID in 2025.

 

Again, depends on timing, but by 2026, we should have a full portfolio.

So, we're not going to say what the exact sales numbers are, but you mentioned $8 billion to $9 billion in costs.

 

I'm not exactly sure where you'd get there unless you're assuming a certain sales line on that, but let me go back to what we tried to lay out here.

If you assume, for instance, $6 billion in sales, we should have 30% of cost, or $8 billion in sales, we should have 25% of cost.

 

And then, we've said historically in our R&D Day that we need $25 billion overall to make this investment, which should average $5 billion a year.

So, hopefully, we're giving you enough pieces without officially guiding any kind of numbers in 2026.

 

But here's what's also important is, if those sales don't come to fruition, we are telling you that we will adjust our expenditures in our investment.

So, that's -- we hope that we are -- they will, we are confident in our pipeline, but should it not happen, then we were prepared to adjust our investment.

 

I missed the second part of the question.



Arpa Garay

Capacity.

 



Jamey Mock

Hey, Gina, can you maybe repeat the second part of your question?

 

I apologize.

I missed it.

 



Gena Wang

Sure.

 

Basically, after manufacturing resizing, what is the full capacity regarding doses, and what percentage will be internal?



Jamey Mock

Yeah, thank you for the question.

 

So, we -- as we try to lay out here and are showing you, this capacity is built for volume leverage.

So, we at least put $10 billion of sales on that page, and it will require no additional capacity.

 

We will complete, of course, over the next year and a half the UK facility, the Canada facility and Australia facility, but for the respiratory framework, we need no more, at least the $10 billion.

I won't project beyond that, but that should answer that question.

 

INT is a little bit different and we are building that and getting that ready for commercial purposes, but we're built for volume leverage moving forward.



Gena Wang

Thank you.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.

 

Your line is open.



Salveen Richter

Good morning.

 

Thanks for taking my questions.

Two from me here.

 

One is, you provided guidance of about $4 billion between COVID and RSV on the [forward here] (ph) for 2024.

Could you just speak to the contribution from each and how you're thinking about flu monotherapy?

 

And the second question is that your financial framework for 2025 includes the ability to flex R&D and SG&A.

Are there any parameters you can share on the range of this flexibility and how you would prioritize R&D programs and development?

 

Thank you.



Jamey Mock

Yeah, thanks, Salveen.

 

I appreciate the question.

So, on the $4 billion, we're not going to break out the $1 billion that we attributed to RSV and COVID.

 

All we can say is we've talked about our PDUFA date and that we filed in certain amount of countries across the globe.

I will also say, as Arpa mentioned in her prepared remarks that we're super confident in the product profile.

 

We are encouraged by the market and how it's already started from an uptake perspective, and we think we will compete very well in 2024 and beyond.

As it pertains to the flexing on our spending for 2025, obviously, I don't know, 80% of our expenses or investments are in R&D, so $4.5 billion for R&D and $1.3 billion for S&A.

 

So that, as I mentioned, 50% of the current spending levels is not committed.

So, we have time to make decisions and watch the market to be able to say what amount of registrational trials and what amount of R&D are we going to spend in 2025.

 

So, hopefully that gives you a sense for how much is still the ability to flex.

We also have other levers that we can pull, et cetera.

 

SG&A, we also have some flexibility, probably not to the same magnitude, but there is still some amount of flexibility to bring that down from a variable expense perspective.



Stéphane Bancel

And Salveen, this is Stéphane.

 

Maybe just to add to Jamey's point on the R&D, as I mentioned in my remarks, if we have to, we will be open, of course, to partnership some of those programs, which is an important way we could flex the R&D number based on where the sales are, as Jamey mentioned, which is if the sales are according to our plan, then we're going to be okay.

If the sales are below, we will be very open to partnering.

 

As you know, we've done that in the past.

The team knows how to do it.

 

But we will be disciplined about our investments in the business based on where the sales line is.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Eliana Merle with UBS.

Your line is open.

 



Unidentified Analyst

Hi, this is Sarah on for Ellie.

 

Thanks so much for taking our question.

First, I guess, can you talk about in 2024 again on that $1 billion RSV international sales number?

 

Are you expecting any contribution from flu in '24, and maybe how you're thinking about it into '25?

And then, on CMV, can you talk about where you are in cases and how they're tracking versus R&D Day where I think you said a fourth of them were currently tracked?

 

That would be great.

Thanks so much.

 



Jamey Mock

So, thanks, Sarah.

 

I'll take the first part and then hand it over to Stephen on CMV.

So, there is no flu contribution in our 2024 sales outlook of approximately $4 billion.

 

So, in that $1 billion, that is solely RSV and other COVID international sales.

We do, as I mentioned in my -- to answering Salveen's question, we do expect to launch flu in our combination products sometime in 2025, and we'll see what we've projected that time.

 



Stephen Hoge

And on the CMV question, thanks for that.

 

So yes, we did update that we're about a quarter of the way through the case accrual back in R&D Day.

I think the next -- we continue to accrue cases at a steady pace.

 

I do think the next update will provide is likely our Vaccines Day in the spring.



Unidentified Analyst

Okay, thanks.

Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.

 

Your line is open.



Terence Flynn

Great.

 

Thanks so much for taking the question.

I know GSK has provided an estimate in terms of size of the RSV market, about £5 billion, and Pfizer has given some metrics as well.

 

Given what we're seeing now with these early launches, can you provide us with your assessment of total market size here?

And then given some of your comments on competing with larger companies, as you're doing in COVID now, where ultimately do you see your market share shaking out in the RSV space?

 

Thank you.



Arpa Garay

Thank you for the question.

 

In terms of the total RSV market, as I mentioned earlier, we're excited by the uptake and the consumer awareness of the market overall.

And our projections are similar to what both GSK and Pfizer have already guided.

 

In terms of our market share with RSV, we have not yet provided or are ready to provide any forward-looking projections on share, but we are very excited about our strong product profile, both in terms of efficacy, safety, and, as I mentioned, our ready to use pre-filled syringes.

So, we will be leveraging the learnings and the success from our COVID commercial launch this year and applying them to RSV next year.

 



Stéphane Bancel

Yes.

 

Just to add to Arpa, Terence, it's Stéphane, the point that Arpa and I made about the market share of COVID is what I think is very important.

I think some people believe that because we're a new company in commercials we're not able to compete and I think the market share data that Arpa has shared really show that our U.S.

 

team is able to compete and we will continue to improve things that we are doing, because we are not done improving the [indiscernible] culture as you know us.

But the share already moving from 36% last year to 45% cumulative so far in the season, I think it's already a demonstration of what the team is able to achieve.

 

And the season is not over, so that's 51%, so let's see where this one finish when the season is over.

But basically, the [differential] (ph) we have, as I mentioned, I've been speaking to pharmacist leadership.

 

And they are all, I think, have a very big workload issue, as you know.

There's even strikes in some pharmacy chains in the U.S.

 

as we speak.

And you think about the season there, [indiscernible] business for the pharmacy for preparations, and then the flu, and then the COVID.

 

And then, as I mentioned, those two other products, if you just download the label of those products from the FDA website and you look at how many steps they have, it's very complicated.

And when you talk to a pharmacy leadership, they don't know how they're going to deal with that type of workload.

 

And so, coming with pre-filled syringe is a tremendous differentiator.

We have very good efficacy.

 

We have very good safety profile.

We really believe that we have the best in-class product in the market.

 

And [indiscernible], it's going to translate, I think, into a very good effect.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan.

Your line is open.

 



Jessica Fye

Hey, guys, good morning.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

Just a couple coming back around to one that I think some others were trying to get at, but maybe a little differently.

 

When we think about breakeven in 2026, what are you contemplating in that sales number embedded in your assumption?

Does it reflect just respiratory vaccines?

 

Or are you considering INT could be on the market then?

And then second, I know you said the percentage of non-retail jobs would grow as the season progresses from where it has been so far this season.

 

Do you believe that the proportion of COVID shots running through the retail channel has shifted at all, bigger picture in 2023 relative to 2022, or should we think of that proportion as remaining similar year-over-year?

Thank you.

 



Jamey Mock

Yeah.

 

Thanks, Jess, for the question.

Again, without getting into too much detail on 2026 in terms of how we think about it, I mean, the best way to keep going back to that late-stage pipeline that we've been talking to you about, RSV, flu, our combination, our next-gen COVID product as well, will all be very much there for the year 2026.

 

And we are confident in all those product profiles and how we will compete.

As I mentioned, at 6%, our cost of sales -- at $6 billion, sorry, our cost of sales would be 30%.

 

At $8 billion, our cost of sales would be 25%.

And of course, we'll try to improve on that.

 

And that will give us the envelope for how much we can continue to invest in the future products, which we said we'll launch 15 by 2028.

That'll be all of our latent product portfolio, that'll be our INT portfolio, that'll be our rare disease portfolio.

 

So, I think that's as much as we can say right now.

I just want everybody to know that we are very committed to breaking even in that year, and we have a lot of flexibility, both from a growth standpoint and a discipline investment standpoint.

 



Arpa Garay

Great.

 

And I can take the second question on the percentage of non-retail.

So, as expected, in 2023, the retailers have been the majority of the market, with more than 90% of the volume during the first few weeks.

 

However, we're now beginning to see a shift towards more non-retail channels, as I had mentioned.

We are seeing increased shipments to IDNs, to clinics, to pediatricians, as of the recent weeks.

 

And as I think about full year 2023, I believe the retail mix will be stronger than in 2022 and could land at about 70% to 80% of total vaccinations, whereas in 2022, we saw that the retail channel was only about two-thirds of the mass.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Luca Issi with RBC Capital.

Your line is open.

 



Luca Issi

Oh, great.

 

Thanks so much for taking my questions.

Maybe circling back on the P&L, I appreciate all the effort on resizing manufacturing and the focus on gross margin, but how should we think about OpEx plus CapEx?

 

As COVID numbers continue to come down, we've seen the BioNTech and Pfizer materially realigning OpEx plus CapEx to their top-line.

I believe BioNTech lowered by $600 million this year and Pfizer by $1 billion this year and $2.5 billion next year.

 

However, your OpEx plus CapEx is not materially changed this year and you anticipate that the next year it's going to be generally flat to down.

So, can you just maybe comment on why you think that's the right strategic decision for the organization?

 

And then maybe second question on RSV.

Obviously, impressive initial launch by GSK and Pfizer and appreciate the differentiations of your product.

 

But what's the latest thinking on whether the vaccine is needed every year or less frequently than that?

Is there a scenario where Pfizer and GSK penetrate the market pretty aggressively this year and then you face an uphill battle next year as it turns out that we need a vaccine maybe every other year and not every year?

 

Any thoughts there much appreciated.

Thanks so much.

 



Stephen Hoge

Maybe I'll take the first -- the second part of that question and then hand it over to Jamey for the first.

 

So, on RSV and the need for it, obviously, we're continuing to follow the public health situation in terms of the rate of occurrence of the RSV epidemic this year.

At this point, I think we don't have data yet on whether or not it will ultimately be an annual or something less than annual, say every two or three year vaccination regime.

 

I think like everybody else, we'll be looking to our data, the other manufacturers' data, as well as the public health, the epidemiologic data to guide that decision.

There are plenty of vaccines for which there is an approach, flu as an example, where there's a seasonal vaccination approach, both because of the benefit offered by the vaccine, but also because of the convenience of just making sure that every season, every year, people are reminded to get that vaccine.

 

So, the ultimate decision on whether this is going to be recommended is not ours, the manufacturer, it will fall to public health officials based on a number of factors, which will include the [indiscernible] and the data we provide, but other factors as well.

And we'll work to make sure they have the data they need to make that decision.

 



Jamey Mock

And I'll take the first part.

 

Thanks, Luca, for the question.

I think the short answer is the opportunity set ahead of us, and we are acting.

 

So, you referenced some of our competitors, so I just want to break that down.

I mean, we are super encouraged by the opportunity for additional growth and our ability to impact patients.

 

And we have this 15 products that we think will launch by 2028 or by 2025.

We think that's the right thing to do.

 

We have to grow out of our, we have to grow this company and to be able to afford the investment to be able to capture the unparalleled opportunity for this.

And I think we are acting, I believe we are acting, and I mentioned everything that we're doing from a cost of sales perspective.

 

And so I think that's very much in line and sized appropriately to have volume leverage when it comes, because it will come.

And we are saying in 2024, we can adjust both R&D and SG&A down to a good level, down 6% R&D, down 13%, so, on SG&A.

 

We are largely committed to our registrational trials for 2024.

But as I mentioned, we don't have as much flexibility in that particular year, but by 2025, we have even more flexibility.

 

So we're prepared to take action should we need to, but we're very optimistic about the price line that's coming.

And hopefully this will just come through growth, and we'll still be able to afford much of this investment.

 



Stéphane Bancel

It's Stéphane.

 

Just maybe adding to Jamey, who said it super well.

As you know, we have a platform company.

 

And the [indiscernible] success of those programs we feel very good about.

If you just look at with COVID and Phase 3 RSV -- sorry, and Phase 3 for RSV and Phase 3 for flu, we have three out of three positive Phase 3.

 

This is not your industry average.

So, we think we can create value and create return on capital for shareholders by investing that capital to high-priority projects that are in late-stage pipeline.

 

As I said, we have the largest late-stage pipeline of any mRNA company.

We have six programs right now.

 

And as soon as we launch [indiscernible], which is very, very soon, there's going to be seven programs.

We believe the best way to create returns for shareholders is to invest that capital to drive sales growth and profitability.

 



Luca Issi

That's it.

 

Thanks so much.

Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies.

 

Your line is open.



Unidentified Analyst

Hi.

 

Thanks for taking our question.

This is Dina on for Mike.

 

I just wanted to get a sense of your assumptions for Q4 COVID jabs and what are you seeing in Q4 right now?

How much of that is actually jabs and actual injections versus channel fill?

 

And just to follow-up on that.

Now that you've seen sort of half of the 2023 fall season play out, what are your assumptions for 2024 and 2025 for COVID?

 

Are you essentially assuming that the same people who got vaccinated this year will continue to get COVID vaccine every year?

Thanks so much.

 



Arpa Garay

Thank you for the question.

 

In terms of the fourth quarter '23 jabs, what we saw in 2022 is there was a significant portion, about 45% of the total COVID vaccinations happening in November and December.

This year, we're expecting a similar split, likely larger, given that we launched two weeks later into the season in 2023 than we did last year.

 

And what we are hearing from our different non-retail customers as well as our retail pharmacy partners is they are planning vaccination campaigns and marketing efforts to really capture on the November and December months.

So, in total, we do anticipate getting to at least 50 million doses this year, and we do believe that November and December will be strong months for us.

 

In terms of 2024, our assumption is everyone who has gotten their booster in 2023 will at least get their booster also in 2024 and beyond.

Now, given the higher burden of disease with COVID, as consumers become more understanding of the annual recommendations and as the convenience of getting both flu and COVID becomes more normalized, we do believe over time we'll start to see some increase in the overall COVID market.

Our next question comes from Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer.

 

Your line is open.



Hartaj Singh

Great.

 

Thank you for my question.

I just got a question on the combination programs.

 

And just to give a little bit of -- frame the question, in other therapeutic areas, aside from vaccines for infectious diseases, for example, oncology, monotherapy treatments generally tend to be minority of treatments, 10%, 15%, 20%.

Currently, monotherapy vaccines dominate the market in COVID-19 flu.

 

So when you get the combination vaccines going, do you imagine -- does your market research tend to suggest that you would -- again, probably a combination approach might dominate that versus a monotherapy approach, singular vaccines going forward?

And then secondly, will the cost of goods sold be any different for the combination versus the monotherapy products?

 

Thank you.



Arpa Garay

Great.

 

Thank you for the question.

So, we do anticipate that our combination vaccine will take a substantial share of the monotherapy vaccines that are available.

 

We have seen in the pediatric vaccine market that upon availability of combinations, you see very strong uptake and conversion from monos to combinations, and we expect a similar trend in the adult market.

From our market research, we have heard consistently from consumers that they prefer one shot over multiple shots.

 

From a customer perspective, we are hearing, as Stéphane had mentioned, just with workload issues, one shot saves a lot of time and also helps them to get more patients protective.

And from a broader healthcare system and government and payer perspective, we are hearing an increased need to help get greater uptake and compliance in adult vaccinations.

 

And our healthcare authorities believe that combinations can help actually boost the vaccination rate.

So, we are very excited about our combination products in the future and think this could really be an inflection point for our mandatory vaccines.

 



Stéphane Bancel

Yes, it's Stéphane.

 

Just to add to Arpa's comments, during COVID, we've been discussing to a lot of -- with healthcare ministers, and the topic of vaccination combination has come a lot.

And as you think, especially outside the U.S., where you have a lot of [indiscernible] taking care of people from birth to death, basically, we are very, very interested in combinations.

 

Because they know that if a participant of a country got the vaccine, they got protection against several viruses which prevent hospitalization.

As you know, we've done partnership with some countries like the UK, Canada, and Australia.

 

And through those negotiations, the concept of combination was critical in their decision-making.

Because as they see their population getting older, they worry that the number of hospitalizations will just go up over time and the ability to prevent that when you see shortages of healthcare workers and as you project those shortages in the future is a key determination of a decision.

 

So, I only think in integrated healthcare system, the drive the [good combo] (ph) will move even faster than actually in commercial markets like the U.S.

market.

 



Jamey Mock

And, Hartaj, maybe I'll take the cost of sales question.

 

Thank you for it.

So this provides a substantial margin expansion opportunity.

 

So, if you think about it, our cost of sales, the smallest portion is our drug substance, so it's our actual mMRA, and that's a very small portion of our overall cost of sales.

Everything from drug product in terms of the cost to finish the product and the presentation type, whether it's PFS or a vial or whatever, that now gets cut in half.

 

So, when we sell two, it's a very limited amount of cost increase versus a single presentation.

So, it does provide a significant margin expansion opportunity.

 

So, thank you for the question.



Hartaj Singh

Thank you all.

Our next question comes from Evan Wang with Guggenheim Securities.

 

Your line is open.



Evan Wang

Hey guys, thanks for taking the question.

 

Appreciate you guys sharing early thoughts on '24 and beyond.

For '24 specifically, you talked about some of the contribution from COVID and RSV in terms of split.

 

It sounds like you plan to hit the ground running there in RSV.

With international, how are you thinking about the longer-term contribution from COVID as competitor agreements expire?

 

And with flu, with the comments on [marketing] (ph) '25, wondering if you've had any recent conversations with the regulators there in terms of potential approval.

Thanks.

 



Arpa Garay

Thank you for the question.

 

In terms of our expectations in 2024, we have put about $1 billion across international COVID and RSV.

We do anticipate a strong launch in the second half of the year with RSV.

 

And on the international side for COVID, we are continuing to pursue multiple options across a number of countries.

In Japan, we will be in a fully commercial market, is our expectation, where we will be competing for the Japanese business.

 

In the EU, we continue to work with countries on agreements to secure our COVID-19 vaccine.

As publicly disclosed, the EU has renegotiated their contract with Pfizer earlier this year.

 

So, the EU demand has been substantially satisfied in many markets, but we are hearing from individual member states that they are looking for a second supplier for vaccines.

And we are in those discussions right now, both at a country level, but also at a European Commission level to see if a joint procurement agreement can be established in 2024.

 



Stephen Hoge

And thank you for the flu question.

 

So, as you referenced, we had really strong data out of our P303 Phase 3 study for flu that we released at R&D Day.

We're excited about that.

 

We are engaging right now with multiple regulators about the pathway to licensure.

I don't have an update about all those conversations because they're happening as we speak, but we will, once we have clarity across all markets on the pathway licensure, provide an update.

Jim Farley

Thank you, Lynn.

 

Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.

I wanted to start by thanking the Ford team who worked tirelessly and creatively over the past several months to reach a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers.

 

I’m so pleased for our employees.

This week, I was able to visit each of the struck plants.

 

I was impressed by their preparation for start-up, and the feeling I got is people just want to get back to work.

Once the deal is ratified, we will provide all of you a deeper look at the contract and its impact on our business.

 

Right now, we’re focused on restarting three important assembly plants, calling back more than 20,000 Ford employees to work, supporting our suppliers as they restart, and shipping lots of Super Duties, Explorers, and Broncos to our customers.

It’s been a challenging situation, for sure.

 

Matter of fact, our business is never short of challenges, especially right now with the evolution of the EV market and new global competitors from China, as well as the technology disruptions.

But I am more excited and motivated than ever.

 

Our team is making tremendous progress every day toward building a Ford that thrives at the intersection of fantastic and iconic vehicles, terrific brands, and especially software and services.

We are deep into the development of our future software platforms, which provide the foundation for rapid innovation and a profitable new software and services business and constantly improving experiences for our customers.

 

We believe Ford+ is the right strategy to win in this constantly evolving industry transformation.

We’re building a more dynamic and less cyclical company, and we are nowhere near peak profitability.

 

We have the right team and talent, and we are in the process of building a culture of excellence and execution.

In a moment, John will detail the quarter, which I would call mixed.

 

The strength of our products and revenues and businesses defined definitely came through in our results.

But at the same time, we were never negatively impacted by the strike, and our cost and quality remain a drag on our business.

 

Now, last week, we made some important leadership changes.

Kumar Galhotra as COO will now control the key levers for transformative change in our industrial system, powertrain, ICE, and hybrid products, vehicle hardware engineering, cycle plan, quality, supply chain, and manufacturing, and work in tandem, of course, with Doug Field, chief EV, digital, and design officer, to move us forward.

 

I believe this will accelerate our progress on cost and quality, and I hope we get into that in the Q&A.

These are my top two priorities.

 

Overall, we see – we are seeing the clear benefits of creating three distinct growth businesses now with Ford Blue, Model e, and Pro.

The story of Ford Blue comes down to product strength.

 

Incredibly strong brands like Mustang and Bronco and Raptor, they have durable pricing power and real choice between gas and hybrid.

Ford is America’s best-selling brand now through three quarters, even with the effects of the strike, and we have a wave of new products coming in the next few months, the new F-150, the Ranger, a brand-new Explorer, and Expedition and Navigator.

 

In fact, close to 60% of our volume and revenues in the U.S.

will be new and refreshed next year.

 

I am so thankful we have kept our foot on the gas to freshen our ICE and HEV products as we enter a changing market.

In Europe, we bring out new versions of Puma and Kuga or high-volume gas and hybrid SUVs, and the Ranger pickup and our Everest SUV that’s based on it continued to gain share in international markets.

 

So, bottom line, Ford Blue will be strong and a growing business for years to come.

We also remain bullish on Model e and our EV future, but clearly, the market is moving – is a moving target.

 

I’m optimistic because customers are smart and are rational, and for many of them, EVs are a great choice.

I’ve been spending a ton of time in our product development center with both Doug Field and Alan Clarke, and you should see the Gen 2 and Gen 3 EVs we’re working on.

 

Our Gen 2 all-new full-size pickup truck, for example, is one of the most thrilling vehicles I have ever seen in my career.

Let me be specific.

 

Stunning performance like no truck has ever performed, building unexpected innovation for truck customers far beyond the normal truck attributes, a super flexible cabin that feels like a lounge or a tiny office.

Take the wheels off this truck, and it’s still a mind-blowing product and a digital experience that totally is immersive and personalized.

 

I’d take this truck seven days of the week over a Cybertruck.

A great product is not enough in the EV business anymore.

 

We have to be totally competitive on cost.

Tesla actually gave us a huge gift with a laser-focus on cost and scaling the Model Y.

 

They set the standard, and we are now making real progress on our second- and third-cycle EVs that are in the midst of being developed today as we get closer to the introduction.

While our Gen 2 EVs were targeting to deliver an EBIT margin comparable to ICE by 2026, the dynamic changes in the market, pricing, adoption rates, regulations are forcing us to further reduce the cost of our EVs.

 

The key levers to deliver this competitive cost structure are scaling, vertical integration, and batteries.

So, let’s double-click on each of these three.

 

On scaling, this is much more than building new facilities or scaling high-quality batteries or thermal propagation.

We’re leveraging digital prognostic capabilities in our manufacturing lines to improve quality.

 

We are also reducing complexity, and we are optimizing our vehicle design and engineering for manufacturability.

Yep, we’re designing these vehicles for our manufacturing team.

 

On vertical integration, this is the most fundamental change.

We are insourcing batteries, inverters, scaling production of our drive units and gearboxes, and designing and producing unit castings in-house at Ford.

 

In addition, on our next-generation utility vehicles, vertical integration will increase by nearly 50%.

This level of integration, along with the new zonal electric architecture and designing in-house modules and battery cell to structure, will allow us to significantly reduce material cost.

 

Now, none of this will be easy, and it has some risk, and you’ve seen our competitors struggle as they build out and ramp up these capabilities.

So, we are so glad we started years ago on this journey.

 

And finally, batteries.

They’re the single biggest cost component of any EV.

 

Our more energy-efficient Gen 2 products, we use extreme aero to get the very smallest batteries possible for competitive range.

And with our LFP batteries, we’ll have the lowest or one of the lowest-cost batteries assembled in the U.S.

 

Our overall EV priorities are very clear, disciplined capital allocation and investment that drives profitable, high-returning and enduring EV business, and we will constantly balance growth, scale, and profitability.

These great EVs will be paired with modern shopping and buying experiences that are transparent or have non-negotiated pricing and a streamlined checkout and delivery that will come to life early in 2024.

 

And this is also a significant cost reduction.

I saved Ford Pro for the last because it’s a massive driver of Ford’s growth and profitability.

 

Our competitors seem to be trying to cut and paste our strategy, but the reality is the moats we’ve built over many decades for our Pro business won’t be easy to cross.

The network of literally thousands of local outfitters across Europe, North America, and China and customer-driven engineering we have for vehicles like F-Series and Transit is formidable across all those regions.

 

Our commercial order banks are healthy.

This may be a surprise to everyone.

 

We see a large backlog of infrastructure projects.

Thank you, 5G and roadworks.

 

And we have very loyal customers.

Fleet orders, for example, for the 2024 Super Duty are coming in faster than last year’s orders, and we expect strong demand to continue as more customers recognize what Ford has to offer in total.

 

In addition to the new Super Duty, we are preparing to launch the new Transit Custom in Europe.

Think of this product as a Super Duty for Europe.

 

It’s a best-selling vehicle in the UK, not the best-selling commercial vehicle, the best-selling vehicle and the leading one-ton van in Europe.

And it’s a key profit pillar for Europe and one of the reasons why we stayed there.

 

When it comes to software and services, Ford Pro is the tip of our digital spear.

Customers know and trust our vehicles, of course.

 

And we’re building on this with software-driven services that provide businesses with data insights, vehicle access, even vehicle control, and functionality.

This helps them drive productivity and efficiency in their fleet operations.

 

And I’ve asked Ted Cannis to also lead our large and profitable aftersales business.

His focus will increase our post-warranty service business and profitability.

 

He’s already adding mobile service capability and delivering an effortless experience to both commercial and retail customers.

There is so much upside in this aftersales, parts, repair, and collision business, especially with Ted leading it and for Ford Pro.

 

I want to briefly touch on China where our strategy to turn our business around is gaining traction.

The restructuring of our EV business there is nearly complete, and the internal combustion engine business is now profitable.

 

We are now expanding China’s role to a profitable export hub, including Ford Pro.

We’ve already exported a record number of vehicles so far from China to markets like Mexico, South America, and Asia.

 

There is so much more opportunity ahead for us.

Yes, the China market is extremely competitive in the middle, but Ford can succeed by staying asset-light, partnering where it makes sense, and competing in very narrow segments where we can clearly win like commercial vehicles, off-road vehicles, large SUVs, and Lincoln.

 

Finally, I’m so pleased to have Peter Stern on today to share more about our newly formed Ford Integrated Services, which will create and market valuable software-enabled customer experiences across Blue, e, and Pro.

Now, this is transformational because the cornerstone of Ford+, the plus in our plan, is creating incredible customer services and experiences enabled by not just hardware but software.

 

There’s simply no one in the world better able than Peter, who is the driving force behind services at Apple, to build this strategically vital business for us.

Peter, over to you.

 



Peter Stern

Thanks, Jim.

 

I’ve spent my career creating new customer experiences and launching businesses at the intersection of hardware, software, and services.

And I came to Ford because this company puts that kind of innovation at the center of its long-term strategy.

 

As you said, it’s literally the plus in Ford+.

Now, over two months in, I’m even more excited to be here and to be part of this exceptional team that’s working together to bring the Ford+ plan to life for our customers, employees, and shareholders.

 

Our vision for integrated services is to transform every aspect of the Ford customer experience across our three segments.

We’re making our vehicles even more connected, convenient, productive, secure, and exhilarating.

 

Over the past couple of months, we’ve identified a portfolio of services that will improve our customers’ lives and businesses by building on our industry-leading early successes with Ford Pro Intelligence and BlueCruise.

This portfolio will elevate the Ford brand and introduce us to millions of new customers who may have never considered a Ford before.

 

It will drive new high margin, cyclical recurring revenue streams for Ford and result in stronger relationships with our customers.

And we’ll do this while adhering to the values that distinguish Ford from our competitors, like our respect for customer privacy, safety, and very importantly, choice.

 

Whether you choose to add our services or not, you’ll have an amazing vehicle.

Our momentum around software and services is building fast.

 

Here are three examples.

First, Ford Pro Intelligence builds on Ford’s industry-leading share in the commercial vehicle space by making the people who drive our vehicles even more productive and by reducing total cost of ownership.

 

Adoption of vehicle telematics, fleet management, and charging optimization were up 20% sequentially in the third quarter, and our average revenue per subscription was up nearly 10% over the past six months, both contributing to strong revenue growth.

And we’re still in the early stages of our rollout.

 

We ended the quarter with 476,000 paid subscriptions for our commercial solutions, a jump of nearly 50% year over year.

And we have an ambitious product road map for Pro.

 

For example, over the next few weeks, we’ll launch the Ford Pro dashcam.

This product uses machine vision and in-vehicle intelligence to detect in-cab and on-road events, simplify fleet operations, and encourage safer driving.

 

While we’re still early in our journey, Pro Intelligence is an area that we’ll continue to expand and drive value for both our customers and Ford.

Second, in September, we announced that the 2024 F-150 will be the first vehicle available in North America with Ford Stolen Vehicle Services.

 

This is a fully integrated theft prevention and recovery service that provides unique features like inclination and movement alerts.

So, you get notified if your truck is jacked up or moved while the engine is off.

 

And third, BlueCruise is one of the most consequential consumer applications of artificial intelligence in the world today.

Some of you experienced our last version at Capital Markets Day.

 

If you haven’t felt what it’s like to take your hands off the wheel and your foot off the gas and let BlueCruise take over steering, acceleration, and braking, please visit a Ford dealer, so we can demonstrate it.

Launch to date, our vehicles have been driven hands-free for 125 million miles.

 

That’s the equivalent of 500 trips to the moon, which I imagine would be largely hands-free as well.

Real-world driving data from Mustang Mach-E vehicles using BlueCruise shows a more than 10 times reduction in lane departures compared with unassisted driving.

 

And for the second time in a row, BlueCruise was just rated the best hands-free system on the market, and this was based on BlueCruise 1.0.

BlueCruise 1.3 is rolling out now and adds lane change support and other refinements that keep drivers in hands-free mode, on average, five times longer than version 1.0.

 

Our technology team, led by my partner, Doug Field, is the best in the business, and BlueCruise is the proof.

Despite these encouraging successes, what we’re about to do in Integrated Services won’t be easy.

 

Our multi-year playbook depends on our next-generation vehicles that are even more connected.

We must also round out our customer-centric portfolio of services and evolve our customer relationship management technologies.

 

Our dealers are a key competitive advantage for Ford, and with them, we need to make it easier to become and stay a services customer.

We need to build a relationship centered around the customer, not the vehicle, because in the services space, the sale of the vehicle should be the beginning of a beautiful long-term relationship with our customers.

 

And that necessitates not only new people, processes, and technologies but also new measures of success.

So, as we progress in our services evolution, you’re going to hear us talk about key metrics like addressable units in operation, attach rates, and average revenue per subscription.

 

And as we move each of these levers in the context of a low-variable cost, high-margin service business, it will have a multiplicative effect on profits.

There’s incredible value to be unlocked here for our customers and for Ford, and I’m proud to be a part of the team making that happen during this pivotal moment in our history.

 

John, over to you.



John Lawler

Thanks, Peter.

 

Through the first three quarters, we delivered 9.4 billion in adjusted EBIT, a strong result that is indicative of our underlying run rate of the business.

Now, given our year-to-date performance, we were on track to comfortably deliver our full-year adjusted EBIT guidance of 11 billion to 12 billion.

 

With that said, the UAW strike created significant uncertainty regarding our full-year results, and even though we have reached a tentative agreement and our employees are starting to return to work, we have withdrawn our guidance for the year.

This is in part because of the continued disruption in the industry with the ongoing strikes, the follow-on impact to our shared supply base, the ramp up of production in our plants and at our supplier partners, as well as other ancillary effects.

 

And to provide some context, in the third quarter, the strike had an EBIT impact of roughly $100 million, and so far, the strike has trimmed about 80,000 units from our plant.

This would reduce 2023 EBIT by roughly 1.3 billion.

 

Once we have a ratified agreement and begin to ramp operations, we will be in a better position to update you on our full-year guidance.

So, let me now turn to our third-quarter results, which was once again – it once again showed our Ford+ plan in action and the benefits of our diversified portfolio.

 

Our leading Pro business and resilient ICE and hybrid products continue to deliver solid results that more than offset the investments we are making in our EV future.

Our revenue remains strong, up 11%, reflecting a product lineup that resonates with customers, driving higher net pricing that remains resilient.

 

Whole sales were flat, dampened by supply constraints affecting both F-Series and Transit production, additional unit holds for quality assurance, and the first UAW work stoppage for Ford in almost 50 years.

Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was 2.2 billion with a margin of 5%.

 

Both improved year over year.

However, costs increased, underscoring the fact that we still have more work to do, especially on warranty expense and material cost.

 

Adjusted free cash flow was 1.2 billion in the quarter, down year over year, driven by unfavorable working capital.

Through the first nine months, we generated 4.8 million of adjusted free cash flow resulting in a conversion rate of 51%, in line with our target range.

 

Our disciplined capital allocation continues to drive strong free cash flow, which will be critical as we adjust our spending to match the pace of EV adoption.

We ended the quarter with over 29 billion in cash and 50 billion in liquidity, one of our strongest quarters ever, and this includes the new 4 billion contingent liquidity facility we put in place in August to help withstand uncertainties in the present environment.

 

Now, turning to our customer-focused segments.

Ford Pro generated EBIT of 1.7 billion and delivered a strong double-digit margin of 12%.

 

Both metrics improved, driven by our Super Duty and Transit franchises that helped deliver a 16% improvement in revenue that’s reflecting strong demand and continued pricing power.

In addition, we are launching a new version of our flagship product in Europe, the Transit Custom, which, along with the new Super Duty and F-150, will give Pro its freshest vehicle lineup in years.

 

We also continue to see strong growth in both our new software subscriptions and mobile repair orders, up roughly 50% and 200%, respectively, for the quarter.

Regarding Model e, our EV start-up incurred 1.3 billion of losses in the quarter, reflecting continued investment in our next-generation products and a more challenging market for our Gen 1 products.

 

Given the dynamic EV environment, we are being judicious about our production and adjusting future capacity to better match market demand.

For example, we have taken out some Mustang Mach-E production, and we are also slowing down several investments, including making a decision with SK On to delay the second BlueOval SK JV battery plant in Kentucky.

 

And we have also said we are evaluating our BlueOval Battery Park Michigan plant to determine the best path forward.

In fact, all told, we have pushed about 12 billion of EV spend, which includes CapEx, direct investment, and expense.

 

The ultimate success of our EV transition will be driven by our Gen 2 and Gen 3 products, which will be cost-optimized and guided by the learnings of our first-generation vehicles that are currently in the market.

Turning to Ford Blue.

 

In the third quarter, we delivered EBIT of 1.7 billion, up 300 million, driven by lower commodity costs and higher net pricing that more than offset higher warranty costs.

The higher warranty was driven by recalls and higher per unit repair costs due to inflation.

 

Importantly, Blue continues to be profitable in all regions with a strong, fresh portfolio poised for continued global success.

Hybrids also continue to be a success, a strategy we’ve had in place now for almost two decades.

 

We are the clear leader of the hybrid pickup truck segment in the U.S, thanks to Maverick and F-150.

We expect to extend its lead next year when we introduce our refreshed 2024 F-150 with more advanced technologies.

 

The F-150 Powerboost hybrid not only offers a 25% improvement in CO2 emissions, but on average, they have more – they are more profitable than our highest-volume gas powertrains.

And hybrids aren’t just limited to North America as we are launching a Ranger for Europe and IMG next year.

 

Ford Credit generated EBIT of 358 million.

As expected, our results were down year over year, reflecting lower lease residuals and financing margin and the non-reoccurrence of derivatives market valuation gains.

 

Credit loss performance remains strong and below our historical average but continues to normalize.

Auction values remain strong but are down sequentially, in line with our expectations.

 

Finally, turning to software and services.

We continue to see sustained quarter-over-quarter growth in subscriptions across all our business segments and, most importantly, at gross margins of around 50%.

 

And our next-generation digital platform will enable a step function change in capability, allowing us to scale and deliver value to both our retail and commercial customers even faster.

And as Peter highlighted, as we continue to build out our capabilities here, we expect it to be a significant source of future value creation.

 

In closing, there’s obviously a tremendous amount going on in our business, but I’m confident in our Ford+ plan and the underlying run rate of our business.

So, that wraps up our prepared remarks.

 

We’ll use the balance of the time to address what’s on your minds.

Thank you, and operator, please open the line for questions.

 
Operator

We will now begin the question-and-answer session.

 

[Operator instructions] Our first question today is from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.

Please go ahead.

 



Adam Jonas

Thanks, everybody.

 

So, John, I know you pushed out the 12 billion of the direct and capital investment and other expenditure on EVs, but I guess I’m saying – I’m interpreting that as just temporary, that you still plan on spending it.

So, my question is, how long can you keep allocating 10 billion a year, round number, to EVs?

 



John Lawler

Yes.

 

So, Adam, we’re going to match demand and capital needed to meet that demand.

You know, the first step here is given the flatter growth curve that we’re seeing relative to what the industry expected and we expected, we’ve made this decision to push out 12 billion of capital expenditures, but it doesn’t mean that we’ll actually go ahead and pull the trigger on it if we don’t need to.

 

And we’re going to look at the overall EV business and be balanced about that.

There’s a lot that’s going to change between now, in ‘26, and ‘30, and we’re going to adjust appropriately.

 

So, it’s something that’s going to adjust as we move and how that business develops, and we’ll adjust that capital allocation appropriately.

And we’ll change our strategy and make different decisions as well.

 

And one of the other things I’d say is that – well, I’ll pass it over to Jim because Jim has something he wants to say.



Jim Farley

Hey, Adam, thank you for your question.

 

I just want to emphasize the importance of our Gen 2 and Gen 3 products because they’re very transformation in our profitability in EV.

You know, we’ve learned a lot in Gen 1.

 

We’ve reduced the material costs.

We’ve got the learning loop on the software.

 

We learned how to scale batteries.

We have the LFP battery now.

 

We’re starting to ship to customers, but there’s only so much we can do on Gen 1.

On Gen 2, I said – as I said, we have a totally different approach from aero vertical integration designed for manufacturability.

 

And there’s a lot of other things we can do beyond allocating less capital to battery plants, for example.

We’ve learned a lot about derivatives like rally.

 

We’re going to push services a lot more like Level 2+, Level 3 autonomy.

And we really plan on even redesign or improving the scale of a components by working with other companies.

 

And the other big breakthrough is going to be which we’re designing in parallel the Gen 3 products where we use the battery as a structural member of the vehicle.

We go to low-cost sourcing, go to smaller vehicles.

 

We maximize unit casting even more than we are and radical cost reduction in our distribution.

I think the other thing that’s important to understand about Ford’s strategy on EVs is Pro.

 

We actually followed a very different strategy for Pro using a multi-energy platform.

So, we didn’t bet on pure electric vehicles for Transit, for example, and we’re now launching the Transit Custom in Europe, and that has diesel gas, and it will have eventually hybrid and pure electric.

 

That’s a very different bet in our Pro.

We’re even starting to export Pro vehicles from China to develop markets around the world that are pure electric.

 

And that part won’t change our product strategy.



Adam Jonas

Appreciate that, Jim.

 

Maybe just a follow-up.

On hybrids, you pointed out in the prepared remarks the growth there, and I think you’ve made comments that technology is something you want to lean in on more as a transition.

 

Not that you won’t continue to sell your Gen 1 EVs, but that there is just real demand for hybrids.

Can you refresh us as you kind of turn that dial back up on hybrids categorically, how that – how the margins on those products might compare to your ICE – your normal ICE margins?

 

Is it accretive?

Is it kind of in the ballpark?

 

I didn’t know if there was any kind of sacrifice or gap there between hybrid and the normal pure ICE.

Thanks.

 



John Lawler

Yes.

 

You want me to jump in, Jim?



Jim Farley

Yes.

 



John Lawler

There’s added costs as you’d expect for the battery and the motors, etc.

 

But if you look at – let’s just take F-Series, for example.

If you take the hybrid on average, they have a higher margin than our highest-volume gas versions because of the mix and what we have in the vehicle and the pricing we can get for the hybrid technology and the fuel efficiency that comes along with that.

 

And one of the things we learned about hybrid, because we’re executing very differently than our first-gen hybrids, is we have Pro power on board.

We have a lot of other attributes that people are willing to pay for, like F-150 powering a jobsite or your house as back up energy.

 

That’s another advantage of having those batteries that maybe some of our competitors haven’t had the same pricing power.

The F-150 now, a hybrid, is up 40% year over year, and we think the new F-150 new hybrid will be 20% mix, and it may be the best-selling hybrid in the United States.

 

So, our hybrid strategy is a little different than our competitors because the work cycle for our products are different, but hybrid has a really big place.

We’re trying to challenge ourselves, Adam, to execute hybrids, so they do more than just propel the vehicle for pricing power.

 



Adam Jonas

Thanks, Jim.

 

Thanks, John.
Operator

The next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America.

 

Please go ahead.



John Murphy

Good afternoon, guys.

 

Just a first question, Jim, on warranty and an accelerated – sort of headwind, on a year-over-year basis, accelerated a bit in the quarter.

But if I look at the full-year numbers, even if we added back this – I think it’s Slide 32.

 

If we added back the 1.7 billion on warranty to the 9.4 billion in EBIT you’ve done year to date, you’d already even be in your range in the first three quarters of the 11 billion to 12 billion in EBIT you’d been talking about before.

So, I mean, it’s a major issue here for the numbers and results in cash flow.

 

What’s going on, and how are you going to get a handle on this and reverse this hopefully in the next year or two?



John Lawler

Yes.

 

So, Adam, that’s exactly right.

One of the things we’re – sorry, John.

 

One of the things we’re seeing is that it’s not just the quality issues which are an important piece of this, and I think Jim wants to comment on that.

But we’re also seeing tremendous inflation from the dealers on the repair costs.

 

And that’s driving quite a bit of it.

If you look at the increase that we had in the quarter for the warranty on a year over year, the 1.2 billion, and say that about 300 million of that was inflationary costs and roughly 900 million was the issue with warranties.

 

So, that’s what we’re seeing there.

And the issue around the quality that’s something that Jim’s going to be going to cover here.

 



Jim Farley

Hey, John, again, thanks for your question.

 

I want to slow it down a little bit and explain kind of our operational headwinds, not just quality but cost as well, and give a little bit of context and maybe highlight some of the stuff we’ve done but the work we have to do.

A couple of years ago, when we started as a management team, the team that’s doing cost and quality is same team, and we have a lot of revenue power in the company.

 

But we also have a lot of technology, and that technology that we rolled out like cameras before our competitors, it puts a huge burden on that electric architecture with a lot of extra modules and software.

We definitely had the largest complexity customer-facing of any brand, and we also ran the business on products instead of platforms and systems.

 

Our engineers and supply chain team did not have competitive tools like IT systems and parts release IT.

We weren’t cooperating with the suppliers the right way on cost reduction.

 

We kind of negotiated them every year, but we weren’t really getting into redesigning the parts and getting the complexity out of the suppliers’ manufacturing system.

We didn’t really use a lot of strategic sourcing.

 

So, we had a lot of concentration, our suppliers, and lack of leverage.

We had inconsistent application within our manufacturing system for our QOS.

 

So, some plants were fantastic like in China and Mexico.

All the plants were completely uncompetitive and run differently.

 

And we traveled hopefully on a lot of the launches.

The gateways, we would have some issues, and the team had, kind of a hero mentality to try to close them out at the end of the launch, and we would get in trouble.

 

I’m really proud of the progress we made like in the last 18 months, but it’s maybe just the tip above the water and the low-lying fruit.

We now have to get after that systematic issue and those issues that I mentioned.

 

On complexity, we have reduced the new F-Series from 1.4 billion combinations to less than 1,000.

And on our new SUVs, we reduced the customer-facing complexity by over 90%.

 

Our QOS execution is getting better.

We’re about 10% improvement in our problems at three months in service, which is a lot of progress for North America.

 

So, the initial quality is getting better.

We now have the talent, both the expertise but also the execution talent.

 

We’re now starting to strategically source our EV components, which we now can apply to our ICE business.

I’m really proud of the launch progress we made.

 

We’re now seeing launch spikes we’ve never seen in a decade at Ford.

We are slowing down those launches, and in the case of Super Duty, its cost is $1 billion, but it was the right trade because it prevents a lot of recalls and issues down the road for the company.

 

And we have made progress on material.

We have billions of dollars of opportunity next year, but we have to deliver and release the parts, and I’m very confident that Kumar’s new organization will be able to really get after the part of the iceberg that’s below the water.

 

That’s been a problem at Ford for decades.

Thank you for asking your question, and I just wanted to take a little extra time to give the full context.

 



John Murphy

That’s great.

 

Maybe I’ll just sneak in one follow-up.

You know, EV demand is not materializing quite as robustly as we were expecting this year.

 

Pricing is a little bit down.

Costs are going to be up with labor.

 

So, I mean, as you mentioned, EVs are going to become more challenging going forward.

But when you think about like a program or a product like the Explorer that we have, at least in car, where it’s launching in calendar year ‘25 as a model year ‘26, and you might disagree or agree with that, but that product is coming at some point soon.

 

That was an EV variant and an ICE variant we had and we were expecting, and it would have been sort of an expectation that maybe you would have crossed out that ICE variant and just had an EV six months ago.

But now, actually, things have switched in the other direction.

 

You might actually cross out the EV and just keep the ICE.

I mean, how are you making these decisions right now with sort of these tectonic shifts going on?

 

I mean, there’s data.

There’s consumer groups and all sorts of stuff, but they’re incredibly difficult and impactful decisions that you have to make.

 

What is the process, Jim, that you’re going through on these powertrain decisions as you’re going through the product launches over the coming years in planning?



Jim Farley

Yes, got it.

 

So, things are changing.

You know, EVs are still in high demand.

 

It’s just, as you said, the pricing is much lower, and there’s a lot of overcapacity in the middle of the market.

For us, I think we’re – our EV strategy and our ICE strategy is to go after customers we know really well.

 

And so, on our ICE and hybrids, very much of a loyalty target.

And in the case of EVs, many of the same segments, but a conquest strategy.

 

And I would say we feel very confident on that strategy because Ford is – has a great reputation in those segments like full-size truck or pickups or vans, commercial vehicles or three-row crossovers, but our products are not substitutional because the customers who we’re going after are different, but they are the same segment.

So, we know the use cycle really well, but the innovation will be pointing in different things.

 

The F-150, I think, is probably the best example at Ford because we have world-class ICE.

We have a hybrid that’ll probably be 20% mix.

 

And then we have lightning and the next-generation lightning that we’re working on right now.

And when you compare the ICE, the hybrid F-150 to the EV F-150, you will be surprised at how much more conquest the vehicle is executed.

 

And we believe that innovation will give us pricing power for those EV conquest customers.

The first generation has helped us there, but I think that’s our strategy.

 

As far as the changeability of that strategy or flexibility, we certainly have choice, but as John mentioned, we’re really flexing the capital and the timing of the capital, especially around battery plants and overall manufacturing capacity.

So, we’re not changing the product strategy, but we are flexing, and that’s our bet, is that we will flex the capacity.

 

From a product planning standpoint, we’ve made, I think, really good bets on the ICE and HEV side in case the EV market is not as fast as we thought.

We have affordable Mavericks.

 

We have a strong international business now with Ranger and Everest.

Those markets won’t go EV anytime soon.

 

And the markets where we’re in, like F-150, Super Duty Pro, they’re not duty cycles that are going to go EV, and we have really fresh product.

So, our bet is maybe different than others who just said, look, we’re going to get rid of an ICE Explorer and go to an EV Explorer.

 

That’s not our strategy.



John Murphy

It’s very helpful.

 

Thank you.
Operator

The next question is from Dan Levy with Barclays.

 

Please go ahead.



Dan Levy

Hi.

 

Good evening.

Thank you for taking the questions.

 

I appreciate, Jim, the commentary that you gave on warranty and just cost more broadly, but I wanted to ask the question maybe in a slightly different way.

This is, obviously, as you pointed out, a lingering issue.

 

I think you said at the CMD earlier this year, it’s a $7 billion cost gap versus your competitors for Blue.

What exactly is the line of sight or how confident are you that these issues can be turned around?

 

Just because these have been issues for some years.

And specifically, in the context of your pivoting to new architectures here where there’s obviously going to be some uncertainty on your end, what gives you the confidence or the line of sight to actually turn around these cost headwinds?

 



John Lawler

Yes.

 

Maybe I’ll start, Jim, and then hand it over to you.

What I would say is that there’s a real focus now in the company, and Jim mentioned it in his remarks, around excellence and delivering, right, execution.

 

When you look at the real fundamental issues that we’ve had across the industrial platform, it’s the way we work together, our focus of the work, and the structure of the work, and there have been those that have thought this has been an issue for years and others that haven’t.

And I think we’re finally starting – not finally, as a team, we are coalesced around those root cause issues.

 

We have great new talent in the company, Liz Door, from a supply chain standpoint, her domain expertise is outstanding.

Bryce Currie from a manufacturing standpoint, outstanding.

 

And then in addition to having Doug, bringing Kumar back into the fold, who grew up in the system as a design and release engineer and understands the Ford system and understands the air states really well, having them all together now driving this foundational change is important.

And as Jim said, it’s the area under the iceberg, right?

 

It’s what’s under the water, and it’s the most important piece of it.

And the progress isn’t showing up as quickly as we would like in the part you see above the water, but the change is being driven below the water.

 

And it’s the same root cause issues that are driving the quality problems, as well as the cost structure issues.

And it’s the material cost at about 4 billion, and now we have warranties about 2 billion, and then you have manufacturing, etc., in there.

 

And so, it’s the talent.

It’s what we’re attacking.

 

It’s the relentless focus on excellence, and it’s the way we’re working together as a team to go after these issues.

And having the new team in place and having the new talent in place and watching what they’re going after and how they’re working together as an integrated team is what we need to get this done.

 



Jim Farley

And I would just complement that in two ways.

 

On quality, our real test for our commitment, talent, all things that John talked about came together in the launches of our most important products like Super Duty.

And I am so confident in our tackling these systemic issues because of what happened on our recent launches.

 

The team doubled down on testing.

They did the extra work on supplier quality and readiness in the factory and really tested the vehicle for failure.

 

And we did something that Ford maybe hasn’t done in the past.

We held the vehicle until it was right.

 

And in the case of Super Duty, that was $1 billion-plus decision.

And that was proof to me this team understands that quality is our top priority.

 

That message was sent throughout the company.

Everyone got the memo.

 

On cost, on EV, I’m encouraged because we’re designing from scratch, and a lot of the talent we brought in approaches that cost is a pride point for them in designing it in.

The real test for us as a leadership team beyond quality is going to be bringing our material cost and negotiated parts price cost down on our carryover ICE vehicles.

 

That is going to be the test, and we believe we have more than $1 billion of ideas already in the hopper for this year, for 2024.

And we got to deliver it on those ideas.

 

They’ll test our standards from rust protection and NHV.

They’re going to test our standards.

 

They’re going to test our parts release process.

It’s going to be – but it’s us to execute.

 



Dan Levy

Great.

 

Thank you.

Just a follow-up quickly on pricing, which I think has continued to outperform beyond anyone’s expectations.

 

Maybe you can give a little bit of voiceover on what you’re seeing on pricing, especially in light of all the questions out there on affordability and how long you think some of these pricing tailwinds can be sustained into next year.



John Lawler

I think it’s different for each of the business segments, right?

 

We’re continuing to see incredible downward pressure on pricing this year on the EVs, right?

But Pro, really strong pricing power right now.

 

As Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks, we’ve got really good strength in the orders coming in for the model year.

You know, we’re a good ways through the model year, and the pricing is held.

 

And then when you look at the fresh lineup we have on Blue, we’re continuing to see the pricing hold for the most part.

Now, are we starting to see that there’s some pressure on pricing?

 

Sure.

And we said there would be, but it’s been more resilient than we thought this year.

 

That’s for sure, especially through the third quarter.

But affordability, we’ve talked about this before.

 

Affordability is an issue.

Right now, it takes a consumer about 14% of their monthly disposable income for a vehicle.

 

Pre COVID and pre the inflation that we’ve seen, it was about 13%.

So, we think it’s going to revert back to that, and then we think it’s going to happen over the next 12 to 18 months.

 

And so, to do that, it would be about a net price reduction of $1,800.

But we also believe that part of that’s going to come through the OEMs in lower prices.

 

But it’s also going to come through dealer margins because dealers are still transacting at a much higher percent of MSRP than they have in the past.

And so, it’s going to be both of those.

 

Now, we expected some of that to occur throughout the year.

So far, it hasn’t much.

 

And so, I think you’re going to start to see that come through as we move into next year.
Operator

The next question is from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.

 

Please go ahead.



Rod Lache

Hi, everybody.

 

I wanted to ask a couple things on EVs.

I think that certainly – I mean, I don’t think – you’ve been saying that the deflation that you’re seeing in EVs has been steeper than you assumed.

 

But I – obviously, your original plan assumed some level of deflation through 2026.

I think it was even price parity with ICE in some cases, and yet you assumed 8% margin in that time frame.

 

Am I correct in those assumptions that your ultimate view was that you would get to price parity with ICE?

And if that’s the case, why – what do you need to do in order to push harder?

 

Do you need to actually reduce prices even below ICE in order to achieve your plan?

Or do you need to achieve even greater – a greater price premium?

 



John Lawler

Yes, Rod, John.

 

Exactly.

If you look at our three-row SUV, the way we thought about that, our Gen 2 product was it’s going to have the exterior of size of an Explorer and the interior space of an Expedition.

 

And so, when we looked at that and setting the targets for the team in 2026, we said, well, you should – we should start out with a revenue assumption that it will be priced on an ICE –as an ICE would be between those two to vehicles.

And so, that’s how we set up the affordable targets that we gave the team to design to.

 

And a lot has changed, but the team is working diligently to try to deliver that.

And we are continuing to see pricing pressure in the EV segment, but right now, there’s still a premium to gas in many areas.

 

So, I think what you’re going to find is, over time, that premium is going to reduce as we move forward.

And that’s what we’re trying – we have built into our planning assumptions for our second-generation vehicle and then as well for our third-generation vehicle, that you’re going to see another step down on pricing so that these vehicles are affordable.

 

And that’s all setting up our cost structure that we’re targeting and going after, which was the basis of setting our 8% margin.



Rod Lache

Okay.

 

So, that’s still your expectation, that you would get to an 8% margin and you would have a cost structure that reflects price parity with ICE?



John Lawler

Yes, that is the target that the team is going after.

 

There’s a lot that has changed, as you know, and the team is working through that.

The key three elements Jim went over is most importantly, the size of the battery, the efficiencies of watts needed to move the vehicle, the vertical integration, the partnering on what we would say are commodity parts of the business, things that aren’t differentiating for additional opportunity there, the scaling and using the capabilities of the vehicle as we build out the manufacturing facilities to be as lean as efficient as possible.

 

And the team is pushing hard to get every save that we can through there to build out our Gen 2 vehicles that are profitable and deliver ultimately the 8% target that we’ve set for them.



Rod Lache

Okay.

 

And just secondly, I’m assuming that you still view vertical integration and batteries and LFP is critical to achieving your cost targets.

Just given all of the issues around that, can you just – and some of the pauses or delays that you’ve got on some of these plants, can you just give us an update on what the trajectory is to achieving those lower costs in batteries, and how is your plan changing?

 



John Lawler

Yes.

 

So, we’re continuing to move forward with the vertical integration on the battery itself, working on cell design.

We’re working on the chemistries.

 

As we said, we have no real change to what we’ve put out forward before on BlueOval Park battery plant here in Michigan.

But LFP is definitely going to be part of our future EVs, and that is a very important cost-reduction step in our path for the Gen 2 vehicles.

 

So, it’s a combination of all of that.

It’s a combination of the battery size and the efficiency of the vehicle to get the lowest watts possible to hit the ranges that we’re looking to hit.

 

It’s the vertical integration across the vehicle, the vertical integration across the battery, and then as well as the chemistries.

And all of that comes together to drive the cost reductions we need and the team is working toward is that part of the vehicle’s target.

 



Rod Lache

Okay.

 

Thank you.
Operator

And our final question today comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.

 

Please go ahead.



Emmanuel Rosner

Thank you very much.

 

So, I appreciate your candid assessment of the EV business and as well as all the actions that you detailed in terms of trying to reduce the investment and losses in the near term.

At the same time, you rightly acknowledged that impacting change – affecting change on the first generation is not going to be the easiest.

 

You know, more change would come in Gen 2, Gen 3.

So, any way you can just frame for us how much improvement can we expect during this first generation?

 

You’re now running at something like a $5 billion annual loss on Model e.

Not that long ago, a few months ago, you still had fairly near-term targets to bring that to EBIT positive.

 

Obviously, a lot has changed.

But then you’re addressing these changes with your actions.

 

So, where does it go from here?

Does it get worse?

 

Does it get better?

Can something be done before Gen 2 and Gen 3 in terms of improving the losses?

 



John Lawler

So, you’re right, a manual step function change is going to be on the Gen 2s where we’ll have more degrees of freedom to make the types of changes I just talked about.

 

On the Gen 1s, we’ve seen the price come down much quicker than we had expected, of course, and that’s showing up in our results.

We’re continuing to work very diligently on additional cost and design reductions on the Gen 1 products, and the team is also working very diligently to minimize the impact of the lower prices in the near term, in the next couple of years before Gen 2 comes out.

 

And so, it’s going to be a battle between managing the top line as best we can, adjusting the supply of products relative to demand so that we can balance the pricing from that standpoint and then working like crazy to put whatever cost reductions we can on that Gen 1 vehicle through to the bottom line.

So, I think it’s going to be in the near term, it’s going to continue to be just that.

 

It’s going to continue to be quarter to quarter.

And the team working very diligently to hold as much revenue as we can and bring as much cost reduction through the product as we can.

 



Emmanuel Rosner

Thank you.

 

And then a quick follow-up on Ford Pro.

Obviously, extremely strong business and very solid quarter, but at the same time, there was a little bit of a pullback in both volume and mix and margin in the quarter.

 

So, can you just go over the factors that drove this and the prospects in timing for normalizing back up?



John Lawler

Yes.

 

So, when you look at Pro the volume was down a bit.

Part of that was we had some disruptions or hiccups from some suppliers which cost us to lose some F-150 commercial volume in the quarter.

 

We had normal seasonality as well like on motorhomes and things like that.

And then when you look at Ranger in Europe, that was down a bit still because of the ramp that we have going on on the new Ranger.

 

And then there was a little bit of improvement with Super Duty.

So, I think you saw some seasonality.

 

You saw some fluctuations due to some supplier constraints and some missed volume in the quarter.

And then, of course we continue to see the strength of the pricing on Super Duty, which is showing up with the higher revenues, yet the volumes were down a bit.

 

So, overall, I think it’s not that we’re seeing a significant reduction in the demand for our Pro vehicles.

We’re not.

 

The order bank is very robust.

We have a lot of demand for the model year, and I think Europe Pro is going to continue to be performing at a high level as we move forward here.

 



Emmanuel Rosner

Good morning, and welcome to General Motors Company Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

 

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.

After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.

 

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, October 24, 2023.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.

 



Ashish Kohli

Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone.

 

We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2023.

Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations Web site.

 

We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.

Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO.

 

Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also join us for the Q&A portion of the call.

On today's call, management will management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations.

These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC.

 

Please review the safe harbor statement on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language.

And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.

 



Mary Barra

Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone.

 

Thank you for joining us.

I'd like to begin by thanking the entire GM team for once again delivering very strong results, including $3.6 billion of EBIT-adjusted in the third quarter.

 

Our supply chain team and logistics partners in North America have done great work improving the flow of vehicles from our assembly plants to our dealers.

Our U.S.

 

dealers have helped us outperform the market from a share standpoint with strong ATPs, and essentially flat incentives.

We were profitable in every region, including China.

 

And GM International is on track to deliver significantly higher EBIT in 2023 compared to a year ago thanks to our operating discipline and the lift we're getting from successful vehicles like the Chevrolet Montana and the Trax.

I'd also like to recognize our teams in Canada and Korea.

 

They reached new competitive labor agreements and ratified them with little or no disruption to our operations.

Because we are in a highly competitive cyclical industry, we have been laser-focused on four fundamentals to strengthen our position; they are delivering vehicles that customers love and are willing to pay for, a competitive cost structure, marketing efficiency and incentive discipline, and matching production to demand.

 

Driving these fundamentals has been and will continue to be the foundation of our consistently strong earnings.

For example, GM has now led the industry in full-size pickup sales for three consecutive years, and we have led full-size SUVs for nearly 50 years.

 

Our overall incentives have gone from consistently above the industry average to consistently below.

And we are on track to exit 2024 with fixed costs that are $2 billion lower net of increased depreciation and amortization than 2022.

 

And we're launching several new SUVs this year and next year that will be more profitable than the models they replace.

We're also taking immediate steps to enhance the profitability of our EV portfolio and adjust to slowing near-term growth.

 

These steps include moderating the pace of our EV acceleration in 2024 and 2025 to maintain strong pricing.

The new launching timing at Orion Assembly also enables us to make engineering and other changes that will make the trucks more efficient and less expensive to produce, and therefore more profitable.

 

Let's dig a little deeper into the steps we're taking with our ICE portfolio to keep margins and EBIT strong in a very competitive environment.

Over the last several years, we have bolstered our position in high-margin segments, including full-size pickups, full-size SUVs, and large luxury SUVs.

 

We did this by managing capacity to meet demand, expanding the range of premium trim series that we offer, and with innovations like Super Cruise and the MultiPro Tailgate, and factory-lifted trucks.

And we're not going to let up.

 

As I said, we're launching a wide range of SUVs that will have automotive gross margins up to five points higher than the models they replace.

The first two are the Chevrolet Trax and Buick Envista.

 

These affordable small SUVs are rapidly gaining market share, and more than 50% of the Chevrolet Trax customers are new to GM.

Then, in the first-half of 2024, we begin launching the new Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia, and Buick Enclave, followed by the next generation of the ICE Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain, which begin launching mid year.

 

Here are the profit drivers.

First, they are in growth segments.

 

The larger SUVs compete with in a segment that we expect to grow by 25%, to three million units, over the next three years, and the smaller SUVs compete in the industry's largest segment, which we expect to grow 9% to 3.4 million over that same period.

Second, they're outstanding products.

 

They offer more comfort and interior roominess, better cargo space, enhanced safety features, and innovative technologies, including Super Cruise, which will be a segment exclusive in the Traverse.

And third, we develop them efficiently.

 

We have simplified the powertrain lineups where we're using 60% of the power and reduce build combination by 80% to 90%.

Now, let's look at EVs.

 

Our commitment to an all-EV future is as strong as ever, and we continue to plan to have annual EV capacity of 1 million units in North America as we exit 2025.

This will allow us to participate in the EV market upside, but we are also scaling in a way that's consistent with the operating discipline I mentioned.

 

Over the course of 2023, our battery cell manufacturing joint venture in Ohio has made tremendous progress.

The plant will be running at full capacity next month, as planned, and they are targeting the production of 36 million cells this year.

 

Next year, production in Ohio is expected to rise to 100 million cells.

At the same time, our battery module constraint is getting better, which helped us more than double the Ultium platform production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.

 

And we are now in the process of installing and testing our high-capacity module assembly lines, which will continue into the first part of next year.

We are currently challenged getting some of the critical equipment components, but we have a dedicated team working with our suppliers to resolve all issues and get these lines running at rate.

 

By mid-year, we expect that modules will no longer be a constraint, and we will be focused on building to customer demand rather than setting new production targets.

Software is another critical piece of the strategy, and Mike Abbott and his team are actively engaged in the early assessment and in each of these launches.

 

Since he joined our team this summer, Mike has been moving aggressively to build a world-class software organization to fully execute our software-defined vehicle strategy while accelerating our vision.

We now have executives with experience from Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Uber, and other leading tech companies heading up our human interface design group, our product software and services group, our software engineering, and our software strategy group.

 

The team is optimizing the software strategy and fine-tuning the plans for our new vehicles to help make sure we executive with the highest possible quality and customer experience, while positioning the company to drive significant revenue growth from subscriptions in the future.

To give the team time to do this, we'll move out the launches of three products, the Chevrolet Equinox EV, the Silverado EV RST, and the GMC Sierra EV Denali, each by only a few months.

 

This will ensure their success.

We believe our products will succeed, and the costs are coming out quickly.

 

For example, our cost per cell has already decreased 45% over the last 12 months as production volume in Ohio has ramped up.

We also expect to achieve significant margin improvement on our battery electric trucks through engineering efficiency and improvement, supplier cost, and reducing order complexity, buildable combinations, and manufacturing.

 

Another key launch for us is the next-generation Chevrolet Bolt EV.

I know there has been some speculation in the market as to why we are developing a new Bolt EV.

 

Our strategy is to build -- is to build on the tremendous equity we have in the brand and to do it as efficiently as possible.

Our prior portfolio plans included several newly designed vehicles in the entry level segments and a capital commitment of $5 billion over the next several years.

 



,

So, now let's turn to Cruise.

 

Since the early days of our company, GM has been defining the future of transportation.

And today, that's more true than ever with Cruise.

 

In February, we celebrated Cruise becoming the first company to [eclipse] (ph) 1 million driverless miles.

Fast-forward to today and they have logged more than 5 million miles, and they continue to expand.

 

Just last week, we announced that GM and Cruise are working with Honda to bring driverless rides to Tokyo in early 2027.

We'll do that with our Origin, the world's first-ever vehicle purpose-built for autonomous driving on public roads.

 

As Cruise continues to push the boundaries of what AV technology can deliver society, safety is always at the forefront.

And this is something they are continuously improving.

 

In fact, it's our zero crash vision that keeps us pressing forward.

And we know from the data that Cruise AVs are involved in far fewer collisions than human drivers.

 

This remains the focus of their ongoing discussions with government partners and regulators at the federal and state levels.

And now, let's talk about strikes.

 

We know we have ongoing strikes at some of our U.S.

facilities.

 

I know many of you are concerned about the impact of higher labor cost on our business in the U.S.

Let me address this head-on.

 

I'll start with the macro environment.

And then, I'll cover how we are positioned to -- positioning the business for success.

 

It's been clear coming out of COVID that the wages and benefits across the U.S.

economy would need to increase because of inflation and other factors.

 

This has been playing out in many sectors for some time now.

I believe that the offer we have on the table with the UAW is better than the contracts that employees at companies like Caterpillar, UPS, and Kaiser Permanente have ratified.

 

The current offer is the most significant that GM has ever purposed to the UAW.

The majority of our workforce will make $40.39 per hour or roughly $84,000 a year in salary by the end of this agreement's term.

 

It also includes the cost of living reinstatement, a 25% increase to the company's 401(k) contributions, world-class healthcare with no out-of-pocket premiums or deductibles for our senior members, and enhanced paid time off, and several other benefits.

Since negotiations started this summer, we have been available to bargain 24/7 on behalf of our represented team members and our company.

 

They have demanded recorded contract.

And that's exactly what we have offered for weeks now, a historic contract with record wages that have increases that are substantial, record job security, and world-class healthcare.

 

It's an offer that rewards our team members, but does not put the company and their jobs at risk.

Accepting unattainably high cost that would put our future and the GM team members' job at risk is simply something that I will not do.

 

Clearly, given the industry's changing pricing and demand outlook and higher labor cost, we have work to do to ensure we achieve low-to mid-single digit EBIT on EV margins targets that we have laid out for 2025.

The work has already begun.

 

And I am confident we will achieve our targets and grow from there.

So, when you add up all the things we have talked about so far, it should be more clear than ever that we have taken and will continue to take decisive steps to grow our revenue while sustaining strong 8% to 10% EBIT margins in North America through 2025.

 

We are optimizing both our ICE portfolio and our cost structure to continue to deliver strong profits.

We are strengthening our EV business.

 

And then, we will accelerate further.

And we have assembled a world-class team to deliver new high margin reoccurring revenue streams from software defined vehicles.

 

It does remain a truly exciting time for us.

Now, I'll ask Paul to take you through the third quarter financials in greater detail.

 

And then, we will move to G&A.



Paul Jacobson

Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone.

 

I would like to start by thanking our team members for once again delivering strong results in the face of several challenges.

To those employees that continue to build vehicles through the uncertainties of the UAW strike, thank you for your focus, your commitment to quality, and passion to deliver great products to our customers.

 

In Q3, the UAW strike had a roughly $200 million EBIT impact, and so far in Q4, we estimate the lost production has had an incremental $600 million EBIT impact.

Moving forward, we estimate that the impact of the UAW strike to be approximately $200 million per week based on the facilities impacted as of yesterday.

 

We're not going to speculate on the duration and the extent of the UAW strike, and because of this uncertainty, we've chosen to withdraw our 2023 full-year guidance metrics even though our strong underlying business fundamentals were pushing us towards the upper half of the range prior to any strike impacts.

After we have a ratified contract, we will provide an investor update to quantify the final impact of the strike as well as labor costs moving forward.

 

Despite these challenges, we're already working to offset the incremental costs.

Mary mentioned the great work the team is doing with the net $2 billion fixed cost program announced earlier in the year, and the winning with simplicity initiative to drive further efficiencies and cost savings.

 

Higher labor costs will make it even more imperative that we continue to focus on the most significant and margin accretive parts of the business.

Let's move now to the Q3 results.

 

Total company revenue was up 5% to more than $44 billion, driven primarily by our consistent pricing and higher wholesale volumes, which were up 2% year-over-year.

We achieved $3.6 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 8.1% EBIT-adjusted margins, and $2.28 in EPS diluted adjusted, inclusive of the $200 million UAW strike impact during the quarter.

 

Production volumes and pricing were up year-over-year.

However, these benefits were more than offset from other parts of the business normalizing, including mix and GM financial, along with our continued investments in EVs and crews, resulting in a $700 million decrease year-over-year.

 

Adjusted auto free cash flow was $4.9 billion, up $0.3 billion year-over-year, driven by the continued strength of our core auto operating performance.

North America continued to deliver strong results, with $3.5 billion in EBIT-adjusted.

 

Pricing continued to be robust, and we are starting to see the benefits of our fixed cost reduction program, realizing about $500 million year-over-year savings in Q3 from lower people cost and marketing savings.

Expected headwinds from pension income, warranty costs, and mix, along with the impact of the UAW strike, more than offset these tailwinds, resulting in a $400 million decrease year-over-year.

 

As we shared in our prior quarter's update on warranty costs, the quality of our vehicles continues to be strong, as demonstrated by the decrease in claim rates year-over-year.

However, we have experienced an increase in the cost of repairing vehicles due to inflationary factors.

 

We are committed to reducing the number of claims and finding efficiencies to minimize costs and are optimistic that year-over-year warranty headwinds will begin moderating in Q4.

EBIT-adjusted margin was 9.8%, and at the top of our 8% to 10% target range.

 

In the U.S., we continue to drive profitable market share growth with 0.7 percentage points year-over-year in Q3, growing both retail and fleet share.

At the same time, we continue to hold incentive spend consistently low and reduce marketing spend by $200 million year-over-year.

 

We have completely modified our approach to incentives over the last few years.

J.D.

 

Power PIN data shows our 2021 U.S.

incentive spent as a percentage of ATP was one percentage point above the industry average of 6%.

 

In 2023, we are trending about a half a percentage point below the industry average of 3.7%.

This $1,500 per vehicle relative performance improvement from 2021 to 2023 equates to more than $3.5 billion in annualized EBIT improvements and is attributable to our strong product portfolio and disciplined inventory strategy.

 

And as Mary mentioned, new and updated products coming in 2024 will have improved profitability, bold designs, and new technology to help continue our sales and pricing momentum.

Total U.S.

 

inventory has remained within our 50 to 60-day range, with a slight sequential increase to 443,000 units at the end of Q3.

This is a testament to the hard work of our team who have navigated through the continued logistics challenges and uncertainties related to the UAW strike.

 

GM International had a solid Q3 performance with Q3 EBIT-adjusted of $350 million, which was consistent year-over-year.

Despite a decrease of $150 million in China equity income, which amounted to $300 million for the quarter, GM International ex-China EBIT adjusted, was $150 million, a significant improvement from breakeven, in 2022.

 

I want to take a moment to take the entire International team for the work they're doing to deliver profitable results, including the actions in China to help mitigate some of the industry challenges.

GM Financial had a strong quarter, with an EBT-adjusted of $750 million, their fourth highest Q3 ever in spite of higher interest rates and lower used car values.

 

This performance was in line with expectations and primarily due to lower net leased vehicle income.

We also saw increased finance charge income associated with portfolio growth, and a higher effective yield offset by that increased interest expense.

 

Corporate expenses were $300 million in the quarter, and consistent with the prior year.

Cruise expenses were $700 million in the quarter, and we expect a similar quarterly run rate moving forward as they balance expanding operations with further efficiencies.

 

A larger fleet of AVs and additional resources drove the incremental $200 million of expenses year-over-year.

I also want to highlight a few items Mary on our retimed EV volume and product production decisions.

 

These actions will impact our previous EV production targets, including the 100,000 EV target we had for the second-half of 2023, and cumulative 400,000 EVs from 2022 to the first-half of 2024.

We are not providing new targets, but are moving to a more agile approach to continually evaluate EV demand and adjust production schedules to maximize profitability.

 

We purposely built flexibility into our manufacturing facilities, and are uniquely positioned among our competitors to be able to flex our production between ICE and EVs.

For example, our Ramos facility builds both ICE and EV variants of the Blazer and the Equinox, along with Spring Hill, which builds the Cadillac LYRIQ along with existing ICE vehicles.

 

These actions prioritize Ultium profitability versus volume, which helps solidify our North America EBIT-adjusted margin target of 8% to 10% through 2025, and the cash flows funding our future in EVs, AVs, software-defined vehicles, and other new businesses.

Given a more agile approach to our EV transition, we now expect to retime at least $1.5 billion of capital spending at our Orion plant, implement engineering improvements, and improve EV profitability prior to accelerating production of battery electric trucks.

 

We'll provide more detail around EV profitability once we have clarity on labor costs.

In closing, I want to emphasize that our EV momentum is building.

 

We see it in everything from cell production, to manufacturing, to software.

We continue to install significant EV capacity, and have the agility and decisiveness to make further adjustments to both accelerate or moderate our transition to adapt to customer preferences.

 

Higher labor costs are at the top of everyone's mind, but will likely be another example of the numerous challenges this team has tackled over the last few years.

And I remain confident we'll continue to execute and find solutions to grow EPS moving forward.

 

The cost initiatives we're implementing are not one and done, but rather a change in mindset that we expect will drive efficiencies for years to come, fundamentally strengthening the company.

This concludes our opening statements.

 

And we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator

Thank you.

 

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.

Your line is open.

 



Rod Lache

Morning, everybody.

 



Mary Barra

Morning, Rod.

 



Rod Lache

I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on the slower demand growth for EVs.

 

Obviously, GM is just getting started now with mass market Ultium products, still the fastest growth segment within the market.

And just at a high level, is this kind of an assessment of the premium that you think EV buyers are willing to pay or are you less optimistic on the IRA becoming a point of sale benefit next year?

 

And just given the investments that you're making, why wouldn't lower volume or pricing assumptions affect the 2025 EV earnings expectations?



Paul Jacobson

What I would say is the observation about slowing EV demand growth is something that everybody's been talking about.

 

We've seen it in competitor earnings profiles, et cetera, but I want to be clear, we're not seeing that in our portfolio right now.

Now, admittedly, that's in considerably lower volumes than some others that are out there, but we continue to see strong demand for our portfolio, and we're making progress on increasing Ultium EV production, with Ultium products up 2x 3Q versus 2Q.

 

So, we are scaling.

But what we've seen here is an opportunity to slow some of that scaling down and take advantage of some of the learning that we've seen through the engineering and manufacturing process in the early stages.

 

And what it allows us to do is to build a stronger foundation before we scale aggressively upwards.

So, that's really what we're seeing.

 

I wouldn't chalk it up necessarily to price.

And what we're seeing in our portfolio is our customers have been remarkably resilient in the order book, continuing to keep their orders on the books.

 



Rod Lache

Great, thanks, Paul.

 

And just secondly, obviously there's consequences to almost any change that affects the business.

At a high level, do you think that GM will need to make adjustments to the company's product strategy to adjust for higher labor costs than some of your competitors?

 

And can you clarify whether this $2 billion net fixed cost reduction contemplates a scenario for UAW costs?



Mary Barra

Rod, this is Mary.

 

Yes, we're committed to the $2 billion that we've talked about.

And we already have tremendous work underway to continue to take costs out of the business.

 

So, I don't really think this changes our product portfolio.

As Paul said, as we get further into the transformation to EV, it's a bit bumpy, which is not unexpected.

 

And so, what we're moving to is something that we can react in a much more agile way to make sure that we have the right vehicles.

And I believe our portfolio that we have that looks at the most important segments, and make sure that we have the right entries.

 

We're already seeing strong demand for entries when we have EVs that people actually want to buy.

So, I think there is a lot of focus in the portfolio to have the right cells, but just to give ourselves more flexibility.

 

And I think the Bolt EV versus the previous [AV] (ph) that we had in the portfolio was a great example.

We were able to get the Bolt EV more quickly.

 

As we've mentioned, it will require a lot less capital deploy.

And frankly, we're leveraging the strong customer enthusiasm that people have for the Bolt EV.

 

So, it's decisions like that where we're still going to have the right portfolio but do it more effectively from a cost and timing perspective.



Rod Lache

Great, thank you.

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi.

Your line is open.

 



Itay Michaeli

Great, thank you.

 

Good morning, everyone.

So just first going back to the Ultium targets in 2025, could you just review the factors that are allowing you to maintain that low-to-mid single-digit EV margin target?

 

Given the lower volume, maybe you could touch upon any changes to the LG relationship, from maybe recent changes there?

And also, if you could quantify a bit some of the engineering changes you alluded to that can enhance profitability?

 



Mary Barra

Sure, thanks, Itay.

 

And exactly as Paul said, we're taking steps to better position ourselves as we expand.

But we are very much committed to the low-to-mid single-digit margin target in 2025 for our EVs.

 

And it's not one thing, it's multiple things.

So, first, as I mentioned just a minute ago, it's having the right products in the right segments that have the right features, the right range, the right functionality, et cetera.

 

That's number one.

And I think the Silverado EV is a prime example when you look at the range that vehicle has in bidirectional charging.

 

So, also, the feedback that we're getting on the Blazer EV is outstanding as well.

So, those are just two examples.

 

It's also the fact that we'll be well into the scale of the battery cells at that point in time.

And I already mentioned how much the cost has come down just from having one module to virtually having, by the end of the year, on plan, we'll have the Lordstown plant fully ramped.

 

And then we're on track for the other plant.

So, getting the Ultium battery cells scaled will be another important piece.

 

I talked about, last time, what we're doing with winning with simplicity.

And really honing in and going to market in a simpler way that, frankly, we think is better for the consumer because they're not overwhelmed with the number of choices they need to make.

 

And taking that kind of order complexity and build combination complexity out drops a tremendous amount of cost to the bottom line from designing it, engineering it, sourcing it, and planning for it to get [lineside] (ph).

And then we've seen product improvements.

 

With the Ultium, it was our first generation.

We learned a lot from the Bolt that went into how we designed this first round of Ultium product, but we're already seeing improvements we can make in Ultium, and then improvements we can make beyond the EV platform in these vehicles that will make them more efficient.

 

And it's appropriate application of things like [giga-castings] (ph), which is already on the C8.

We learned a lot on the CT6.

 

It will be a part of CELESTIQ.

And there's other vehicles that we haven't announced yet that it will be an important part of.

 

So, it's, frankly, looking at fundamentally everything.

But we remain committed to get there.

 

And, frankly, where lithium prices are trending is another enabler.



Itay Michaeli

That's all very helpful.

 

And as a quick follow-up, maybe wanted to touch upon Cruise, with Cruise really scaling now to multiple cities and making a lot of progress, any just thoughts on funding going forward, as well as any strategic thoughts you can share as Cruise goes into the next stage of growth?



Mary Barra

Well, we're going to have a lot more to say about Cruise in the latter part of this year.

 

Paul will be at a Barclays Conference.

We also will have fourth quarter earnings, and then our Investor Day.

 

So, we do believe that Cruise has tremendous opportunity to grow and expand.

Safety will be our gating factor as we do that, and continuing to work with the cities that we're deploying in.

 

So, we'll have more to say about that at a later date.

But rest assured we do have funding plans that will support Cruise's expansion.

 



Itay Michaeli

Perfect, that's very helpful.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with UBS.

Your line is open.

 



Joseph Spak

Thanks.

 

Good morning, everyone.

Just to follow up again on the Ultium strategy and some of these changes here.

 

How flexible are you finding that program is to be able to make these changes?

And are some of these learnings you talked about that you plan to implement on Silverado also scalable to the other products or should we think that -- basically, should we think about there being a need for like an Ultium 2.0 platform in the couple of years versus what we're seeing today in the market?

 



Mary Barra

As we've already said, the Ultium platform is chemistry-agnostic.

 

And so, we will continue to look to make programs.

And as we go forward, we will adapt.

 

There'll be, I think, Ultium 2.0 as we get into the latter part of this decade, as well as many other parts of the vehicle.

Again, I think it's hard to really explain without being in person.

 

And we'll do this when we're together at our Investor Day, of the simplification that we can do to the vehicles that makes them easier to build.

And, frankly, the mindset change we've had from a complexity perspective is pretty significant.

 

So, again it's yes, there's going to be improvements.

We'll continue to drive efficiencies in the Ultium platform.

 

But it's also, broadly, across the entire vehicle.



Joseph Spak

Okay.

 

And then, Mary, on the -- there was a comment about the Ohio battery JV being able to be at full capacity by the end of this year.

I think that's like 35 gigawatt-hours if I recall correctly.

 

So, how does that JV, which I know you're only part owner, plan to balance that with GM's own EV demand?

Is there going to be a continued ramp there and produce, and maybe build some stock or look for additional offtake?

 

And also, does this revised EV timeline impact any of the other battery JVs coming online?



Mary Barra

No, we plan on having the ramp at Lordstown will continue as it is.

 

And the plant in Spring Hill comes online next year.

And then we have plant three in Michigan that follows, and then the work with Samsung.

 

We'll keep all of those on track because we believe strongly that we need those cells.

Now, obviously, if we have to evaluate and slow something down, but at this time we don't see a need to do that with the plans that we've outlined here.

 



Joseph Spak

Okay, thank you.

 



Mary Barra

Hey, Joe, just on that, again, I want to reiterate.

 

We're going to respond to demand.

And we're going to make sure we have the right products at the right time, but we're not overbuilding.

 



Joseph Spak

Perfect.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.

Your line is open.

 



John Murphy

Good morning everybody.

 

Mary and Paul, when you think about the capital commitment that's going on in the business lobby, it's always very large, but with EVs and things that are shifting on technology and products, product plans, it seems a little bit more uncertain, a little bit more dynamic, and it has historically.

Do you think about returns on capital as we shift into this EV world?

 

Can they potentially be higher and shorter-dated?

So, they give you more flexibility to make changes like you just did with the vault, or are we still thinking about sort of seven to 10 year decisions like we did on the ICE side?

 

I think there's a lot of folks that think this is a real risk, but it sounds like it also might be an opportunity to be more flexible?



Paul Jacobson

Yes, good morning John.

 

Paul, I think that's what we're aiming to and I think creating the foundation of reducing complexity and buildable combinations and more simpler engineering design manufacturing, I think is going to give us that agility going forward.

I think the other thing that you're going to see us, and I think the Orion announcement is a good example of this, is we're also engineering improvements on the fly.

 

So, I think if you look at the historical record, it would be you produce a vehicle, you would identify some improvements in customer features, profitability, et cetera and you'd wait for a mid-cycle model improvement to actually go in and implement those changes.

It's really more of a mindset that's, I would say more conducive to software that says, here's an opportunity to really improve the profitability, the capability of the vehicle, let's go ahead and put it in line.

 

So, the Orion decision represents an early application of that where we've seen a slowing in the demand growth create the opportunity to go in and build these from the ground up as we expand and scale up.

And I think it's going to make us more nimble in the future and ultimately lead to more consistent ROIC.

 



John Murphy

And then just one follow-up on the strength in sales year-to-date, the U.S.

 

market really seems to be buoyed by fleet sales more than retail at the moment and you guys usually have a better line of sight and visibility into orders from your fleet customers.

So, one, if you can confirm that strength has really been driven by fleet relative to expectations at the beginning of the year.

 

And two, is there visibility that this is going to last kind of like it did in '10, '11, and '12 sort of as a consistent driver of the upside of the cycle early in the cyclical recovery?



Paul Jacobson

Well, I think, John, we've been consistently talking about pent-up demand from the last couple of years, and that's been really evident in the fleet customers.

 

But I would say that the retail share gains and the performance of the retail customer has been strong as well.

In fact, we've seen gains in market share pretty consistently this year, both from fleet and from retail, while we've increased production, while we have kept incentives down, and while we have reduced marketing spend.

 

So, I think it's a real testament, especially to the North America team for what they've performed through and what they've done in the face of that strength.

And while we hear reports out there in the macro that consumer sentiment might be weakening, et cetera, we haven't seen that in demand for our vehicles, and we've been pretty consistent about that on the retail side as well.

 

So, we're continuing to enjoy that, and I think we're operating from a much more disciplined lens around margin improvement as a result of what we've seen in that transformation.



John Murphy

Okay.

 

Thank you very much.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.

Your line is open.

 



Emmanuel Rosner

Thank you very much.

 

Good morning.

First, a couple of clarifications on the 2025 targets for the EV business, so, low to mid-single-digits margin.

 

I think when you initiated that guidance, this was excluding the IRA sale manufacturing credit, but I think including them, you could have gone to mid to high single-digits.

Is that still very much the case, or are you saying that now including IRA, you would be at the low to mid-single-digits?

 

And then on the volume piece, or I guess the capacity piece, to the extent that your capacity is flexible between EVs and ICE, would you consider reducing the 2025 EV capacity target in the future of the industry dynamics or demand that was weaker than expected?



Mary Barra

Well, first on the first question, we remain committed to low single-digit margins IRA.

 

Nothing has changed there.

And so, as you said it would be similar to ICE like margins with what we believe we know the IRA to be.

 

We still are waiting for final clarification from Treasury on a couple aspects of that.

And then, again, as Paul outlined, with the flexibility we have in Ramos, with the flexibility that we have in Spring Hill and our plants, I don't think it's that we'll adjust down the amount of capacity that we'll have.

 

It's just that we're going to be able to respond very quickly to EV or AV depending on where the customer is and what they demand.

So, I think we're going to need the capacity and again the flexibility that we have is I think going to be one of the ways that GM is going to be better positioned to serve the market for both ICE and EV as we move in this transition period.

 



Emmanuel Rosner

Okay, that's helpful.

 

And then, I guess more broadly for the overall business, just clarifying your net cost reduction target of $2 billion.

This is, I assume this is before any labor cost inflation expected from the new contract.

 

But can you please clarify this?

And assuming that this does not include that inflation in the net reduction, what sort of actions are you contemplating to try and offset that labor cost inflation?

 

What could be done above and beyond the $2 billion to offset any additional cost increase?



Paul Jacobson

So, good morning, Emmanuel.

 

It's Paul.

What I would say is that the $2 billion is around controllable fixed costs and we remain committed to being able to do that.

 

The implications of the UAW contract when it is agreed to and ratified will flow significantly and largely through cost of goods sold in our margin performance.

So, when you look at the ways that we have to offset that, those are things that affect the EV profitability, et cetera going forward.

 

So, what we've got to do is make sure that number one, we sign a contract that we know we can compete in the global marketplace because we want to make sure that these are good jobs and they are good jobs for the next people as well that are going to taking over.

We are protecting the brand, the company, the franchise, and the future.

 

So, we are going to have to look at potentially reducing fixed costs further.

We are going to have to look at efficiencies across the board in engineering and designing the vehicles.

 

And that's a little bit of trying to get ahead of some of those inflationary pressures that we saw with the steps that we have taken earlier this year.

So, we are going to continue to look at doing that.

 

And we've got some work cut out for us, but we are committed to making it work.



Emmanuel Rosner

Great, thank you very much.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.

Your line is open.

 



Adam Jonas

Hi, good morning.

 

Mary, you've acknowledged for some time that the General Motors share price is not really getting any credit for the cruise business.

I think many would argue that at $29 a stock might even be implying a negative value for cruise, which I think you'd reckon would be pretty ridiculous.

 

So, my question is, besides continuing on growing and executing on the business, I know we're going to learn a lot in the next year.

Is there anything else that your management team or board could possibly do to unlock value for the cruise business?

 



Mary Barra

Adam, first of all, I completely agree with you.

 

I think the stock is undervalued.

Even if it was just an ICE EV and software company, I think the cruise piece of it is further.

 

I think as we continue to expand cruise in a very thoughtful way, focused on safety, I think people will see and start to unlock.

I mean, just last week we announced the opportunity that we have with Honda and Cruise and General Motors in Japan.

 

And so, to be able to be involved in driving expansion, not just in the United States, but globally, I think it's going to be an important part of Cruise's mid to longer-term future of success.

So, we do believe in the technology.

 

As I said in my remarks, it is safer than a human driver and is constantly improving and getting better.

And that's what we're focused on doing.

 



Adam Jonas

It's really amazing to see the growth in San Francisco.

 

I know people that use it every day.

Just a follow-up for Paul, you guys have been very specific, I think within a range at least of a 2025 EV target of the mid to high single digit without IRA.

 

You're obviously not disclosing where EV margins are today.

So, I'm not going to press you on that because you would have disclosed it.

 

You're choosing not to.

But I think in some of your comments, if I heard you correctly, Paul, you said you're not doing it today because of the labor situation or you know until you get the clearer picture on labor but when we get through this standoff with the UAW, can we expect that you will be specific of what the starting point is in the next year?

 

So, we could understand the delta from how loss-making the EVs are today clearly they're loss making but had to put a number on it, so that investors can have greater transparency the delta.

Is that something you can commit to please?

 



Paul Jacobson

Yes, good morning, Adam.

 

First of all just to clarify in your comments the target is low to mid-single-digits ex-IRA.

I think you said mid to high in your question.

 

I just want to correct that for the record.

But yes clearly look as we said repeatedly this year the margins in EVs are just relatively nonsensical mainly because we've got a big scaled infrastructure with limited production across the board.

 

So, we are absolutely committed to presenting that roadmap and we'll do that at our Investor Day and the decision to push out Investor Day was really we've got a lot of good strategic data points to put out there.

We want to make sure that it wasn't something that was dominated by the UAW.

 

So, when the weather gets a little bit warmer in Charlotte in March, we'll have that Investor Day.

We'll provide that roadmap including kind of where we've come from and where we're going to get to that low to mid-single-digit margin target, and we're making good progress internally.

 



Adam Jonas

Thanks, Paul.

 



Paul Jacobson

Absolutely.

 

Thanks for your question.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from James Picariello with BNP Paribas.

Your line is open.

 



James Picariello

Hi, good morning everyone.

 

I'm curious to get your thoughts on incentive spending for the fourth quarter and just the overall pricing backdrop in North America, I mean obviously we have there are production limitations type of strike right now.

But just how are U.S.

 

inventory data supply trending, today relative to quarter-end and just any color there would be great.

Thanks.

 



Paul Jacobson

Yes, good morning, James.

 

So, in terms of incentive strategy, like I said in my prepared remarks, I think the team deserves a lot of credit for really transforming the approach and the go-to-market strategies, not just around incentives, but how we market the vehicles and really across the board that has been a huge contributor to some of the profitability that we've had on the backs of the strength and the consumers and the products that we're producing across the board.

So, I expect that strategy to continue.

 

Certainly as we looked at quarter-end, inventories had trended a little bit higher, and of course this varies on a product-by-product basis.

And we're watching that very closely in partnership with our dealers to try to make sure in light of the work stoppage that we are getting vehicles to market where we have them.

 

So, we're going to continue to manage that very tactically across the board, but everything that we're seeing in the demand set right now is pretty strong for our vehicles, and we expect that to continue through the rest of the year.



James Picariello

Okay, that's helpful.

 

And then, my follow-up, can you just confirm the materials and freight impact in the quarter and just at a high level as we think about next year based on current commodity spot pricing, any visibility you might have in supplier costs, just how we can think about this cost bucket for 2024?

I believe the 2023 guide, the prior 2023 reflect for an expectation of neutral, any color there would be great.

 

Thanks.



Paul Jacobson

Yes, it's a little early to get into that.

 

We're in the midst of our budget process right now, but what I would say is we have seen some logistics and delivery pressure that we've talked about before, particularly with vehicles coming into North America from Mexico with rail challenges, et cetera.

So, I expect there will be parts where there's some inflationary pressure, but as we've said over the last couple of years, the amount that we spend on expedited logistics, et cetera has been coming down as the chip shortage and some of the supply chain shortages have been tempered from the peaks in 2021 and 2022.

 

I will say that there's a bit of concern on my mind in terms of the supply chain's ability to ramp up after the work stoppage.

Obviously, we're focused on getting this finalized as quickly as we can.

 

But it's important that we don't end up in a situation where we can't ramp up to full production because the supply chain has to rebuild, et cetera.

So, we're watching that closely and making sure that we're in a position, but more to come on 2024 as we work through that and work through the budget.

 



James Picariello

Thanks.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays.

Your line is open.

 



Dan Levy

Hi, good morning.

 

Thank you for taking the questions.

I wanted to start first with just a question on the volume versus price mix interplay.

 

Pre-COVID, you were at, call it -- anywhere from 3.2 million to 3.6 million units of annual volume.

And this year on some of the consensus numbers, strike aside, will be closer to call it, 3 million units.

 

Now you're absorbing more in the way of labor costs.

I think we're waiting to see what happens with EVs, but most would view EVs to be a cost challenge.

 

So, you've already done a really good job showing us the benefits of mix and pivoting to profitable units.

I think that was something you alluded to in your prepared remarks and really a business that in a way, shown slight pivots away from volume.

 

How much more do you think the business can focus more on mix and profitable units and relatively reduced focus on volume?



Mary Barra

Well, Dan, I appreciate the question.

 

We really want to focus on both, but it's got to be profitable growth.

When you look at the EVs and even our ICE vehicles, I just mentioned that the Trax 50% of the customers for the new Trax are new to General Motors.

 

So, from an EV's point specifically, we think that along the coast where EV adoption is higher, that's going to be a growth opportunity for us over the next several years.

And we're going to just focus on continuing to have winning ICE and winning EV products that people want to buy.

 

And so, I don't I felt like your question is saying, are you just going to shrink?

And the answer is no.

 

That's not our intent.

Our intent is to be profitable and then grow and expand, and we think we have the opportunity to do that.

 



Paul Jacobson

And Dan, I think I'll add that, I think the challenges of the last few years, I think have taught us a lot about ourselves and about the quality of our products.

 

And it all starts with that when you create products that customers love.

You have an opportunity to think about the business.

 

So, while the profitability and the margins have gone up.

We've been really focused on that.

 

But some examples of that are what we're doing with buildable combinations, what we've been doing with marketing spend, et cetera, it's really focused on driving at the unit level, the margin improvement across the board.

So, focusing on those premium mixes where we know the demand is focusing on the premium vehicles where there's supply constraints.

 

Those are lessons that we can take into the future going forward and are going to help us not just with ICE profitability and margins, but also help pave the way for an EV strategy that is really focused on consistent margin performance going forward.

So, incredibly proud of what the organization has done, and certainly think there's more to come.

 

Now we've been doing all of this in a lower SAAR environment and feel really good about our ability to continue that should we get back to more historical normal levels at higher volumes across the board.

So, I think it's been good lessons learned, and you never let a good crisis go to waste.

 

And I think that's where we've seen some really good long-term permanent learnings for the organization.



Dan Levy

Great.

 

Thank you.

And then, second question, I wanted to just go into the dynamics behind the battery plants.

 

Thank you for the commentary earlier that you're starting to run at capacity on Lordstown.

Spring Hill that sounds like that's a slight delay.

 

I think that was just the launch this year staying at 2024.

Lansing is after that.

 

Maybe you could just give us a sense on where the other two battery plants stand?

And to what extent is the gating factor more on supply versus more so listening to the near-term demand.

 

And if you need to, you can delay some investment to ramp on the other two battery plants?



Mary Barra

So, as I mentioned before, we will have the Lordstown plant up full capacity at the end of this year, which then allows for it to have a full-year next year.

 

The Spring Hill plant will start early next year.

There was a couple of weeks, it was supposed to originally start at the end of this year.

 

There was a couple of weeks due to some construction delays but it now is on track, and it will ramp with all the benefit of the learnings.

And we fully believe we're going to need all the cells from both of those plants.

 

And then, when you get to the Michigan plant, again, we think that there's going to be demand there as we continue to though be agile and resilient and build to where customer demand is, we can obviously make some changes there.

But right now the cadence I talked about is when those plants start and that the fourth plant will be likely very early '26 having good, good progress with Samsung.

 

So, we're not slowing the ramp of the battery plants down at all.

I think as you know, battery cells are the constraint of the industry.

 

And so, we're going to -- we think we're going to need all of those even with this ramp change that we've made with Orion and some of the other programs I mentioned it's just -- it's a couple months in most cases.



Dan Levy

Great, thank you.

 
Operator

Thank you our next question comes from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo.

 

Your line is open.



Colin Langan

Great.

 

Thanks for taking my questions.

The UAW made a big announcement -- big deal about the concessions at the battery plant.

 

Just wondering if you have any color there because I was a bit surprised because that's in a joint venture, so I wasn't sure how you actually could give concessions.

Any color on what the nature of that agreement is and how you're able to kind of come to terms with them there?

 



Mary Barra

Right now the Ultium team that is a separate company is negotiating, that the employees at Lordstown voted to unionize, and so that local leadership team is negotiating with the UAW to have their own agreement.

 

We did have some conversations and we did put an offer on the table that would put the Ultium cells under the scope of the master agreement and we believed at the time that it would allow for which it must have benchmark economics and also operating flexibility because the battery cell plant is very different than some of the traditional operations we won right now, but at this point that offer remains open, but the focus is on Ultium getting their own agreement.



Colin Langan

Got it.

 

Just we're still in early days at EVs.

There seems like demand is eased already and it's great that you have the flexibility to kind of switch between EV and ICE, but the regulations in the U.S.

 

kind of push easy at least at some point in the future, do you think there's any change in the tone of Washington of potentially pushing out some of those targets, doesn't it become a bit of a challenge of consumers aren't interested in buying EVs and you're just the only way to sell them would be to hit your margins, right?



Mary Barra

Yes.

 

I mean, obviously, we provide regular input into the administration and the regulatory agencies.

I've been very clear and on the record that the regulations can't get in front of EV demand at some of which is will be enabled by having a robust charging infrastructure.

 

So, we regularly have those conversations, and we'll do what it takes to meet the regulatory environment as well.



Colin Langan

Got it.

 

All right, thanks for taking my questions.



Mary Barra

Sure.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.

Your line is open.

 



Mark Delaney

Good morning.

 

Thanks very much for taking the questions.

I very much appreciate the plan to be flexible on the cadence of the EV ramp and the opportunity for GM to implement some incremental cost reductions, but given that scale was one of the key inputs in EV profits, can you just better understand if there is a certain minimum amount of volume that you may need to be yet in order to reach your load to mid-single-digit EV margin target in 2025?

 



Paul Jacobson

Yes.

 

Good morning, Mark.

So, what I would say is it's a little bit of a step function, right?

 

So, as we build a plant or transform a plant, we've got to fill that up to maximize efficiency, so the decision to defer Orion is really an example of not rushing to build that full infrastructure before we know that we can fill it up.

So, ultimately it leads to more of an efficient transition.

 

So, what I would say is we've got good capacity at the facilities that we've already transformed and we're working to scale those to that capacity as quickly as we can.

So, it remains a big part of it but I think you're going to see a little bit of step changes through the transformation as we bring that incremental capacity online, but that's part of our plans, it's all rolled into the targets that we've outlined on our ability to hit the load of mid-single-digit margins on EVs in 2025 and then grow from there.

 



Mark Delaney

Thanks for that Paul.

 

And then, on the international business, the company was profitable including in China, despite what's been a difficult market backdrop.

Can you speak in more detail on how you think the international market will progress from here?

 

Thanks.



Mary Barra

Well, if we first start with the GMI market X China, again, we see a really strong improvement across all of the countries that we're in from South America to the Middle East to Korea et cetera.

 

We're going to continue to focus on and the -- one again it's operating disciple.

It's also having the right products for those markets and understanding in some cases especially in markets like South America where we price for what's happening from a current foreign currency exchange perspective.

 

And we are seeing the products because of the strength of them hold up.

So, very pleased with where the GMI markets are.

 

And as you focus on China, China is still -- we are looking for potentially a modest recovery continuing into Q4.

But the real focus for General Motors in China is to make sure we get our Ultium products out there from a Buick and a Cadillac perspective.

 

And then, also focus on the right products from an SGM Wuling perspective.

And then, remember we are also expanding for premium import.

 

And we think those three initiatives are going to position us well even in uncertain market that we are facing in China that gives us a lot of optionality at the -- I'll say the entry level on value part of the market, the mid part of the market, and then at the top part of the market.



Mark Delaney

Thank you.

 

I would now like to turn the call over to -- back to Mary Barra for closing comments.



Mary Barra

Great.

 

Well, thank you, Amanda.

And thanks everybody for joining the call today.

 

It's clear that we are dealing with a lot of near-term uncertainty.

And then, also the -- I'll say the transition that -- to EVs that will have ups and downs.

 

But I hope it's equally clear that we are going to be acting with purpose.

We are going to remain agile.

 

And we are making sure we have a system that has the ability to respond to where the market is.

And our commitment is to deliver a strong and profitable ICE business as well as a strong and profitable EV business for our future.

 

In addition, I think if you look deeper into the organization that Mike Abbott has built from a software perspective, this is really foundational for us to be able to capture additional revenue with a very different margin profile than some of the aspects of the vehicle and the business that we have today.

And then, finally, we see tremendous opportunity with Cruise.

 

And we'll continue to work across not only this country working with our regulators to make sure we can deploy Cruise safely.

I know the UAW contract is one of the biggest sources of uncertainty right now.

 

But I want to remind you with what I said earlier, we will not agree to a contract that isn't responsible for our employees and for our shareholders.

We need to make sure we have a contract that is going to allow us to compete and win in what is a challenging market for EVs and also allows us to support the business that we have with strong margins in our ICE business.

 

When we do reach an agreement, we will schedule an event shortly thereafter to discuss the economics and our strategy for managing them.

And as Paul said, we will host our next Investor Day in March to go even deeper into the ICE, EV, AV, and specifically our software plans.

 

When you look at our growth businesses especially Cruise and software, we are at an inflection point right now.

And see tremendous upside opportunity and growth.

 

And so, we look forward to discussing each of them with you in more detail as we move forward.

So, make no mistake, GM is very committed to all EV future.

 

We are not changing any of our goals there.

We are just trying to make sure the company is more agile and resilient so that we can be successful as we manage this transformation.

 

So, want to thank you again for joining us.

Thanks for your questions.

 

And I hope everyone has a good day.
Operator

Thank you.

 

That concludes the conference call for today.

Thank you for joining.

Elon Musk

[Call Starts Abruptly]…of new factories and we believe there’s still meaningful room for improvement there.

 

Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicles are now driven over 0.5 billion miles with FSD beta, full self-driving beta, and that number is growing rapidly.

We recently completed a 10,000 GPU cluster of H100s.

 

We think probably bring it into operation faster than anyone’s ever brought that much compute per unit time into production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy.

We’re also seeing significant promise with FSD version 12.

 

This is the end-to-end AI where it’s photon count in, controls out.

Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.

 

The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.

And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.

 

So, interesting to think about that.

We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.

 

And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far.

If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not clear what the limit is.

 

Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.

And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.

 

Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.

The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.

 

I am too.

I’ve driven the car.

 

It’s an amazing product.

I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.

 

This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.

So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price that people can afford.

 

Often people do not understand what is truly hard.

That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.

 

People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.

And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to design a prototype.

 

But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like 10,000% harder to get to volume production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash flow.

That is why there have not been new car startups that have been successful for a 100 years apart from Tesla.

 

So, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck.

It’s a great product, but financially it will take, I don’t know, a year to 18 months before it is a significant positive cash flow contributor.

 

I wish there was some way for that to be different, but that’s my best guess.

The demand is off the charts.

 

We have over 1 million people who’ve reserved the car.

So it’s not a demand issue, but we have to make it and we need to make it at a price that people can afford, insanely difficult things.

 

In conclusion, we continue to focus on ramping production while maintaining positive cash flow and we continue to target -- expect to have around 1.8 million vehicle deliveries, as stated earlier this year.

The Tesla AI team is I think one of the world’s best, and I think it is actually by far the world’s best when it comes to real world AI.

 

I’ll say that again, Tesla has the best real world AI team on earth, period, and it’s getting better.

And lastly, I wanted to thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times.

 

Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact that you’re making.



Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.

 

And our CFO, Vaibhav, has some opening remarks as well.



Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks, Martin.

 

Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of profitability in our energy business.

Congratulations to the Tesla team for the continued focus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer sentiment.

 

As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our factory upgrades.

This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases.

 

Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $37,500.

We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight.

 

Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.

On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo.

 

We have and will continue to make investments in these areas, and hence our capital expenditure and R&D will continue to grow in the near term.

However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations.

 

This year itself, we have generated operating cash flows of approximately [$8.9 billion] (ph) and free cash flows of approximately $2.3 billion.

Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with energy business leading the charge, primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments.

 

Our services and other businesses on a year-on-year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from our growing fleet.

As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car buying happens with one or other form of financing, and hence we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for the customer.

 

And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S.

have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity.

 

We’ve tried to offset such adjustments via focus on reducing costs.

However, there is an inherent lag in cost reductions, which in turn impacts margins.

 

To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S.

whereby you can get a standard Model Y for as low as $399 a month.

 

In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we’re focused on reducing costs, maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next generation platform.

We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term.

 

Once again, I would like to thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.



A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

 

And now let’s go to investor questions.

The first investor question comes from Craig.

 

How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for 2024?



Elon Musk

It’s difficult to make an accurate guess at this point.

 

Going back to what I said earlier that the ramp is going to be extremely difficult.

And like I said, there’s no way around that.

 

If you try to make -- if we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally 200 models that are slight variations on a theme in the combustion engine world, distinctions without a difference, then it’s really not that hard.

But if you want to do something radical and innovative and something really special, like the Cybertruck, it is extremely difficult because there’s nothing to copy.

 

You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car.

So, the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome.

 

Now, I can say that -- if you say, well, where will things end up?

I think we’ll end up with roughly a 0.25 million Cybertrucks a year, I don’t think we’re going to reach that output rate next year.

 

I think we’ll probably reach it sometime in 2025.

That’s my best guess.

 



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

The second question is, can you provide a progress update on the 4680 cell, particularly progress towards performance improvements and cost savings outlined on Battery Day?

Thank you.

 



Unidentified Company Representative

Sure thing, Martin.

 

4680 cell production in Texas increased 40% quarter-over-quarter.

Congrats to the Texas team for producing their 20 million cell off of line one.

 

Texas is now our primary 4680 facility.

We’re heavily focused on quality.

 

Scrap is down 40% quarter-over-quarter.

With the increased volume and yield improvements, cell costs consistently improved month-over-month within the quarter, although we have a lot more work to do to achieve our steady state goals.

 

And that is our priority.

The Cybertruck cell with 10% higher energy than our Model Y cell started production on line two in Texas.

 

This quarter we convert to building a 100% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four lines in Phase 1 over the next three quarters.

Phase 2 of the Texas 4680 facility is currently under construction.

 

The additional four lines incorporate further capital efficiencies over Phase 1, and our target is for them to start producing in late 2024.

Lastly, in Kato, we’re retooling to enable large scale pallet runs of our next generation cell designs.

 

Kato’s long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our mass production facilities, enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp ups of new designs.



A – Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

The next question from institutional investors.

Could you please provide an update on capacity expansion plans for company’s factories in Berlin and Austin, and the opening schedule of Gigafactory Mexico?

 



A – Unidentified Company Representative

Berlin and Austin factories, the current priority is actually maximize the output from our existing lines, by laser focus on efficiency improvement.

 

As always, maintaining a high quality and the reducing per unit cost will be as critical as growing the production volume.

For Mexico, we’re working on infrastructure and factory design in parallel with the engineering and development of the new production that we’ll be manufacturing there.

 

That’s what I can share for now.



Elon Musk

In Mexico we’re laying the groundwork to begin construction and doing all the long lead items.

 

But I think we want to just get a sense for what the global economy is like before we go full tilt on the Mexico factory.

I’m worried about the high interest rate environment that we’re in.

 

I just can’t emphasize this enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment.

And as interest rates rise, the proportion of that monthly payment that is interest increases naturally.

 

So, if interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it’s that much harder for people to buy the car, they simply cannot afford it.

And we are tracking, I believe at this point for Model Y to be the best selling car on earth, but not just in revenue, but in unit volume.

 

If you compare that to the other vehicles that are number two and number three and whatnot, they cost much less than our car.

So, we’re just hitting law of large numbers situations here.

 

I know people want to us advertising, we are advertising.

I think there’s something to be gained on the advertising front.

 

I don’t think it’s nothing.

But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn’t really help.

 

So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.

So, this is big deal.

 



Martin Viecha

The next question is, when do you expect Model 3 Highland to be available in the U.S.?

 

I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don’t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls.

So let’s go to the next one.

 

Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver 2.3 million vehicles in 2024, representing 28% growth versus 2023 guidance.

Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in 2024?

 

And when does Tesla expect to return to its 50% long-term CAGR?



Vaibhav Taneja

When we look at 2024, there are a lot of moving pieces.

 

I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment.

So, we’re focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our options, and we’ll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of 50% forever, or you will exceed the mass of the known universe.

I think we will grow very rapidly, much faster than any other car company on earth by far.

 



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

Next question is do you have an approximate timeline in mind for the robotaxi driven or non-driven?

What excites you most about how this project is progressing?

 



Elon Musk

Well, robotaxi is like necessarily non-driven.

 

I guess, I’m very excited about our progress with autonomy, the end-to-end, nothing but nets self-driving software is amazing.

It drives me all around Austin with no interventions.

 

So, it’s clearly the right move.

So, it’s really pretty amazing.

 

And obviously, that same software and approach will enable Optimus to do useful things and enable Optimus to learn how to do things simply by looking.

So extremely exciting in the long term.

 

As I mentioned before, given that economic output is a number of people times productivity, if you no longer have a constraint on people, effectively, you’ve got a humanoid robot that can do as much as you’d like, your economy is wisely infinite or infinite for all intents and purposes.

So, I don’t think anyone is going to do it better than Tesla, not by a long shot.

 

Boston Dynamics is impressive, but their robot lacks a brain or like the Wizard of Oz, whatever.

Yes, lacks a brain.

 

And then you also need to be able to design the humanoid robot in such a way that it can be mass manufactured.

And then at some point, the robots will manufacture the robots.

 

Now obviously, we need to make sure that it’s a good place for humans in that future.

We do not create some variance of the terminator outcome.

 

So, we’re going to put a lot of effort into localized control of the humanoid robot.

So basically, anyone will be able to shut it off locally, and you can’t change that, even if you put -- like a software update, you can’t change that.

 

It has to be hard-coded.



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

The next question is, why was the price dropped on FSD if it is getting better and robotaxi is expected so soon?



Elon Musk

Well, we just wanted to make it more affordable as more people try it.

 

Yes, I think, over time, the price of FSD will increase proportionate to its value.

So we regard the current price as a kind of a temporary low.

 



Martin Viecha

The next question is again on FSD.

 

Mercedes is accepting legal liability for when its Level 3 autonomous driving system drive pilot is active.

Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for FSD?

 

And if so, when?



Elon Musk

Well, there’s a lot of people that assume we have legal liability judging by the lawsuits.

 

We’re certainly not being let that off the hook on that front, whether we’d like to or wouldn’t like to do.



Unidentified Company Representative

I mean I think it’s important to remember for everyone that Mercedes’ system is limited to roads in Nevada and some certain cities in California, doesn’t work in the snow or the fog.

 

It must have a lead car in plains, only 40 miles per hour.

Our system is meant to be holistic and drive in any conditions, so we obviously have a much more capable approach.

 

But with those kind of limitations, it’s really not very useful.



Elon Musk

No, I think some people understand the profundity of the Tesla AI system.

 

It’s very, very few.

It’s basically Baby AGI.

 

It has to understand reality in order to drive, Baby AGI.



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

The next question on Optimus.

Will Optimus be working on Gigafactory lines next year?

 

If so, how many would you guess will be deployed?



Elon Musk

I think at this point, we are not ready to discuss details of the Optimus program, but we will make -- provide periodic updates online.

 

So, as you can see, we’re -- Optimus a year ago could barely walk and now it can do yoga.

So, a few years from now, it can probably do ballet.

 



Martin Viecha

Sounds good.

 

And the last question from investors is Neural net path planning represents a significant advance in capability and safety for FSD.

What steps is Tesla taking to make this technology available outside the U.S.?

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

Our approach has been to try to get it -- like the more places we’re trying to make it work, the harder the problem is.

So, the reason we don’t do it in all countries simultaneously is that it would take much longer to make it work anywhere at all.

 

So, that’s why it’s currently just North America.

And also for most parts of the world, you have to get approval before deploying things, whereas in the U.S., you can deploy things at risk or at least you take liability for what you’re deploying.

 

So, it’s -- most countries require some sort of extensive approval program.

So, we only want to go through that extensive approval program when we think it’s kind of ready for prime time in that country.

 

I apologize it’s not in those countries, but we keep plenty of ways to make it better.

And it really needs to drive such that it exceeds the -- even unsupervised, significantly exceeds the probability of entry of a human or significantly better, a lower probability of entry than a human by far.

 

I think we’re tracking to that point very quickly.

Obviously, in the past, I’ve been overly optimistic about this.

 

The reason I’ve been overly optimistic is that the progress tends to sort of look like a log curve, which is that you have kind of rapid initial improvements that if you were to extrapolate that rapid fairly linear rate of improvement, you get to self-driving quite quickly, but then the rate of improvement curves over logarithmically as such to asymptote.

That’s not happened several times.

 

I would characterize our progress in real world AI as a series of stacked log curve.

I think that’s also true in other parts of AI, like LLMs and whatnot, a series of stacked log curves.

 

Each log curve is higher than the last one.

So if you keep stacking them, keep stacking logs, eventually get to FSD.

 



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

Let’s now go to analyst questions.

The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist.

 



Will Stein

We learned earlier on the call, it sounds like you don’t think the truck will ramp to significant volume until its third year of production.

 

Should we have a similar anticipation for the ramp of the next-gen platform, or is there any reason that we should be maybe more optimistic or pessimistic about the ramp profile there?



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

I mean, to be clear, it’s not really the third year of production.

It’s kind of like the 18th month of production is roughly my guess.

 

So, it’s just that they happen -- it will happen -- is that the -- it starts this year, spans next year and gets to 2025.

So technically, there are three calendar years in there, but there’s actually only 18 months, not three years.

 

I would be very disappointed if it took us -- and that would be shocking if it took us three years.

But 18 months from initial deliveries to have -- to reach volume and reach prosperity with an immense -- I can’t tell you how much the blood, sweat and tears level required to achieve that is just staggering.

 

I have been through it many times.

Then, here we go again.

 



Will Stein

Similar path for the next-gen platform?

 



Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, there’s like unique complexity to Cybertruck.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

I mean Cybertruck is -- yes.

I mean, we dug our own grave with Cybertruck.

 

Nobody -- generally, everybody digs a grave better than themselves.

And so it is -- Cybertruck’s one of those special products that comes along only once in a long while.

 

And special products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market, to reach volume, to be prosperous.

It’s fundamental to the nature of the newness.

 

So now the sort of high-volume, low-cost smaller vehicle is actually much more conventional.



Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.

 

In terms of like the technologies we’re putting into it, we didn’t have to invent full hard stainless steel or have mega 9,000-ton castings or the largest hot stamping in the world or new [Technical Difficulty] are quite in the same way as the Cybertruck.

I think it will be quite a fast ramp.

 

As I was just saying, we’re doing everything possible to simplify that vehicle in order to achieve a units per minute level that is unheard of in the auto industry.



Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, the single location makes it easier to automate.

 

It also makes it lower cost.

Yes, that’s intrinsically lower cost.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

Let’s be clear, it will be cool, but it’s utilitarian.

It’s not meant to be -- fill you with magic.

 

It can get you from A to B.

It will be still beautiful.

 

But it’s utility.



Unidentified Company Representative

That’s not 14 inches of [indiscernible] suspension.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

So I mean, the Cybertruck has a lot of bells and whistles.



Martin Viecha

All right.

 

Thank you very much.

Let’s go to Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.

 



Pierre Ferragu

I have first like a follow-up question on FSD and pricing and adoption.

 

So, I agree with you that as FSD improves, we should see its value increasing.

But I guess, like the ultimate values of FSD, which is to be able to handle like a robotaxi is not going to necessarily interest everybody, and you have a bit of a degraded version that would be like a chauffeur service where the car drives by itself, but you still have to be in the car and around.

 

And then there is like the hands-on -- eyes-on version of the service.

And I guess, there should be like much lower cost, lower feature kind of variance of the service that could have a very large penetration on your installed base and more expensive one that would remain at a lower penetration level.

 

So, I’m just wondering if you’re taking that -- and last but not least, like the simplest version of FSD available and are going to work from a technical perspective, probably before like the ultimate robotaxi version can work if ever.

And so I’m wondering how you take that into account and how you’re thinking like the financial contribution of FSD over time and whether you could evolve your pricing along that kind of tiers to increase adoption.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

A fully autonomous vehicle, I think, Pierre, your -- sort of the economics of autonomous vehicle are truly astounding in a positive way.

When you look at passenger vehicles today, they only get about 10 to 12 hours of usage per week.

 

That’s -- if you drive 1.5-hour a day on average, that’s roughly 10 hours a week out of 168 hours.

And then there’s also you’re going to have parking and insurance.

 

You got to take care of the car.

It’s like there’s a lot of overhead.

 

So I mean, yes, it’s like the economics of the system are just insanely positive given that the car -- like all of the cars we’re making and have made for a while, we believe, are capable of full autonomy.

So then if you’re able to say increase the utility of that car by a factor of 5, which only means that you’re -- it’s being used for maybe 50 hours a week out of 168, so you still notice -- you’re still assuming -- that still assumes less than 1/3 of the hours of the week is doing something useful.

 

You’ve increased the value of that by 5, but it still costs the same, like you have something -- then we’re a hardware company with software margins.



Martin Viecha

Pierre, do you have a follow-up?

 



Pierre Ferragu

Yes, I have actually a follow-up on different topic for you that I have if that’s okay.

 

It’s about like your gross margin in the quarter.

Could you give us a sense of like in how the gross margin evolved sequentially, how much was the impact of idle cost?

 

How much was like the sequential benefit, I imagine, of production ramping at Berlin and Austin?

And then I saw like this massive jump in energy storage, very strong positive surprise.

 

So, if you can give us the background on that and tell us how we should think about that gross margin going forward.



Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks for the question.

 

So, in terms of -- you have few different aspects of your question.

So if I just look at from Q3 perspective, obviously, factory idle time had an impact.

 

It did impact by -- and I won’t give you the exact percentage, but it had a decent impact for the quarter.

And when you look at the other pieces, which we are trying to do, we did see certain of our other factories ramping up pretty well, right?

 

And they actually contributed pretty well to the margin for this quarter.

In fact, one of the factories came pretty close to in terms of per unit cost to where we are for our other established factory, which is Fremont.

 

So that was a positive in the quarter.

When it comes to energy margins, Megapack deployment was the key driver there.

 

And that product has done well.

I mean, on the cost curve also, we’ve been able to do a lot there.

 

But I do want to caution that Megapack deployments are a bit lumpy.

So yes, we had a great quarter this period.

 

But depending upon where we are trying to deploy that product in different markets, you would see periods where there would be downward pressure on deployment because of us trying to get the product to that base way…



Unidentified Company Representative

Yes, product in transit.

 

Yes.



Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.

 



Martin Viecha

Okay.

 

Thank you very much.

Let’s go to Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.

 



Rod Lache

Really nice to see the rate of vehicle cost improvement despite the downtime that you took.

 

You’ve taken now about $2,000 out of the average vehicle costs over the past year.

Can you give us maybe a sense of the rate of improvement that you see from the changes that you alluded to, the factory changes you alluded to?

 

Is there a way maybe to convey the speed of improvement on your existing product from here?

And then related to that, can you share the timing of your next-gen -- the lower-priced product that you talked about earlier this year?

 



Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.

 

So just in terms of product margins, there are lots of puts and takes when you look at this.

There are certain things which we control, and there are certain things which we don’t control.

 

We get -- we expect that we’ll get some benefits from our cost reduction efforts, which are all underway.

So on the other hand, we just finished our factory upgrades late in Q3.

 

Some of these factories are still in the early ramp phase in Q4.

We’re still not up to where we want those factories to be.

 

So, they will impact in the near term.

Plus, like Elon mentioned, we’re going to be ramping Cybertruck, which is going to be another headwind, which we will be dealing with.

 

On top of all that, there’s overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which even makes it harder to predict precisely as to where we land.

But yes, this is something which -- it’s an evolving thing which we’re observing every day and reacting to it on a daily basis.

 



Unidentified Company Representative

I would just say that on the cost reduction efforts, like we are not -- we are unflagging in our pursuit of additional cost downs for 2024.

 

We do have a good pipeline of them and work on both the engineering side and the factory operations side.

And our intention is to like maintain or exceed the trend that you saw, trying as hard as we possibly can.

 



Rod Lache

The timing of the next-gen product, can you share that?

 



Elon Musk

Not at this time.

 



Rod Lache

Okay.

 

And just as a follow-up, obviously, price is also a driver of demand, but that’s obviously not happening in a vacuum.

And you mentioned that -- I think you mentioned that at some point during this call that you’re also maybe hitting the law of large numbers on some of your products.

 

Can you just share how you’re thinking about price elasticity just at this point in this macro environment?

And any thoughts along those lines?

 



Elon Musk

I think that there’s very significant price elasticity.

 

I mean, to be totally frank, if our car costs the same as a RAV4, nobody would buy a RAV4 or at least they’re very unlikely to.

It’s worth noting that a lot of these incentives, like the tax credit and whatnot, they’re actually very difficult for the average person to access because they -- most people do not have $10,000 or even $7,500, burning a hole in their bank account.

 

A lot of -- a large number of people are living paycheck to paycheck, and with a lot of debt.

They’ve got credit card debt, mortgage debt.

 

So, that’s reality for most people.

It’s sometimes difficult for people who are high income and I’d say high to be like someone who’s earning over $200,000 a year to understand what life is like for someone who is earning $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a year, which is most people.

 

So like for a lot of people, like this tax credit just -- they can’t front $7,500 for 18 months or even 6 months to get -- for the tax credit, and they actually don’t, in some case, even have that $7,500 in taxes.

So, it’s really just the best regard to people is how much money do they have to pay immediately and how much per month.

 

That’s it.

I think you stop right there.

 

And our car is still much more expensive than a RAV4 when you look at it that way.



Vaibhav Taneja

Now one other thing which I’ll add, when you look at car buying in general, we’re trying to get to the next set of EV adapters.

 



Elon Musk

Not an EV adapter.

 

Just who wants a great car.



Vaibhav Taneja

Exactly.

 



Elon Musk

It’s not -- so now you get things like -- honestly, I would say it’s like -- somewhat correlates with why doesn’t everyone work from home crowd.

 

I’m like -- I mean this is like some real Marie Antoinette vibes from people who say why is there no work from home.

Like what about all the people that have to come to the factory and fill the cars or that all people that have to go to the restaurant and make your food and deliver your food.

 

It’s like what are you talking about, you -- I mean, how detached from reality does the work from home crowd have to be?

While they take advantage of all those who do -- who cannot work from home.

 

So, I mean, you have to say like why did I sleep in the factory so many times, because it mattered.

So I just can’t emphasize again how important cost is.

 

It’s not an optional thing for most people, it is a necessary thing.

We have to make our cars more affordable that people can buy it.

 

And I keep harping on this interest thing, but I mean it just raises the cost of the car.

I mean, we’re looking an internal analysis, which we think is more or less on track that when you look at the cost -- or the price reductions we’ve made in, say, the Model Y and you compare that to how much people’s monthly payment has risen due to interest rates, the price of the Model Y is almost unchanged.

 



Vaibhav Taneja

If you factor in the...

 



Elon Musk

Yes, which is what I’m trying to say.

 

The thing that matters is the monthly -- it’s how much money do they have to put down and do they literally have that in their bank account or their check balance and then what is the monthly payment.

And it doesn’t matter how -- if that monthly payment is principal interest or whatever, it’s just a number, and that number has to not cause their bank account to go negative.

 

That’s it.

So going from near zero interest rates to kind of the current very high interest rates, the actual monthly payment is basically the same.

 

It’s just a bunch more of it is going to interest.

And there are some incremental challenges beyond that, which is the difficulty of getting credit at all has increased.

 

And so, the number of people who simply cannot get credit, period, even if they’ve got a job and everything is solid, the banks are a little gun-shy on handing out credit given that a bunch of them kicked the bucket earlier this year.



Unidentified Company Representative

There’s also just fewer options, even if they planned out credit, there’s fewer banks to go there.

 



Elon Musk

Digital banks still exist.

 

Well, if your bank does not exist, you have to establish a relationship with a new bank.

And so a lot of regional banks are died, and I mean even Credit Suisse, I mean, geez, that was a shocker.

 

A 160-year-old-ish Swiss institution, it doesn’t exist anymore.

That’s mind blowing.

 

And I think there’s still quite a few shoes to drop on the bad credit situation.

I mean, commercial real estate obviously is in terrible shape.

 

Credit card debt has been rising significantly.

The credit card interest rates are usurious.

 

It’s over 20% interest rates, meaning like -- which over time is just it becomes obviously extremely punishing because if somebody’s paying 20% interest on their credit cards, means they cannot pay them off.

If you can’t pay them off and you’re still accruing interest of 20%, you’re at best headed to a bad place.

 



Martin Viecha

Thank you.

 

Let’s go to next question from George from Canaccord.



George Gianarikas

Just to focus on the cost per vehicle coming down in future quarters as you discussed in your written remarks.

 

I’m curious as to what the levers of that could be.

Is it more scale, more factory utilization?

 

Is it material cost reductions?

Are there things like gigacasting?

 

I mean, can you just kind of give us some data points to give us confidence if that’s going to come down over time.

And if I can sneak one in, please, there are press reports -- and I know how perilous it is to believe some of these.

 

But, they say that you’ve included radar as an option in some Model Ys in China.

And I’m just here to ask if that’s true.

 

And if so, why?



Elon Musk

We’ve not included radar.

 

We have radar as -- a Tesla designed radar is an experiment in Model S and X.

That’s it.

 

We’ll see whether that experiment is worth it, but there are no plans to integrate radar into 3 and Y.

Just as humans drive well, and in fact, an excellent human driver can drive with amazing safety simply with their eyes, the car will far exceed the average human safety just with vision, far, far, far because, I mean, the car is looking at all directions all at once.

 

We don’t have eyes at the back of our head.

And the computer never gets tired and never gets distracted, get drunk, hopefully.

 

And so, radar is -- what really matters is how much does it affect the probability of an accident.

And in order for the radar to be effective, you have to be able to do radar-only braking -- you have to do actions that are radar-only.

 

Otherwise, you get this disambiguation problem between vision and radar.

That’s why we actually turned off the radar in cars historically that we had shipped, all 3 and Y used to have radar, but we turned it off because the radar actually generated more noise than signal.

 

Now the Tesla designed radar is a high-resolution radar that has some potential to be useful, but the jury is still very much out on whether that is in fact the case.



Unidentified Company Representative

On the cost question, I guess, from the vehicle side, like as Drew mentioned earlier, we are always trying to engineer our products to be cheaper to make and more efficient to make.

 

That comes obviously on the engineering side as we come up with new innovations but as well on the supply chain side.

With our partners, we work with them to automate some of their lines and move their bottlenecks and their high cost as well.

 

On the logistics side, getting parts to the factory, it’s not like a one thing that -- you have to check cost everywhere and we do it ruthlessly at all times.



Unidentified Company Representative

Operations efficiency.

 

All of the above.



Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.

 

I would say there’s a whole laundry list of things, which we are chasing.

We internally call it the cost attack, where we’re literally going line by line and saying how can we make it better.

 

And it’s a grind.



Elon Musk

It’s a grind.

 

It’s like Game of Thrones but pennies.

I mean first approximation, if you’ve got a $40,000 car, and roughly 10,000 items in that car, that means each thing, on average, costs $4.

 

So in order to get the cost down, say, by 10%, you have to get $0.40 out of each part on average.

It is a game of pennies.

 



Unidentified Company Representative

We play it.

 



Elon Musk

Willingly, yes.

 

We’ve done it many, many times.

And even something as simple as like a sticker, like there’s too many stickers internally in the car that nobody ever sees.

 

There’s something as simple as a QR code.

You may think, well, putting a QR code on a part.

 

Why don’t just put them on there, it’s like, well, are we actually going to use that QR code?



Unidentified Company Representative

That’s a penny.

 



Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.

 

And then inevitably, sometimes the QR code doesn’t go on properly or you can’t read it properly, and it stops the line.



Unidentified Company Representative

More than a penny.

 



Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.

 

So chipping away, with -- I mean it is trying to -- it does feel like digging a tunnel with a spoon at times.



Unidentified Company Representative

Very much escaping prison.

 



Vaibhav Taneja

On top of it, like we said, we did some factory upgrades, so we expect volume to go up.

 

That would also bring some savings from higher production.

But then on the flip side, we’re going to be ramping a new product like Cybertruck, which we talked about.

 

So, yes, so those are the real puts and takes what we are working for.



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

But there’s not like some accidently some brick of gold that we go left in the car, unfortunately.

And it’s -- we’re trying to be very rigorous about improving the quality and capability of the car because it’s like any fool can reduce the cost of a car by making it worse and just deleting functionality and capability and that’s how I call this sort of any fool -- like if you want to like lose weight and you’d say, well, I need to lose over 15 pounds right away, well, you could chop your arm off, but then you’re sitting with one arm.

 

You’re still fat.

So sort of like yes, you actually have to eat less food and work out.

 

That’s the actual way.

It’s not super fun because food is delicious.

 

And personally, I’m not -- I don’t love working out.

I wish I did, but I don’t.

 

Unless moving the mouse consists of working out, in which case, I love moving the mouse.



Martin Viecha

All right.

 

Let’s go to Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.



Colin Langan

You said in the commentary that you’re not going full tilt on the plant in Mexico until there are signs that the economy is strong.

 

Can you continue at a 50% CAGR without that plant?

And where would that come from?

 

And any color on what you mean sort of not going full tilt?

Could that plant get delayed indefinitely, or what are you are kind of talking about?

 



Elon Musk

No, we’re definitely making the factory in Mexico.

 

We feel very good about that.

We put a lot of effort into looking at different locations, and we feel very good about that location, and we are going to build a factory there, and it’s going to be great.

 

The question is really just one of timing.

And there’s going to be a broken record on the interest front.

 

It’s just the interest rates have to come down.

Like, if interest rates keep rising, you just fundamentally reduce affordability.

 

It is just the same as increasing the price of the car.

So I just don’t have visibility into it.

 

If you can tell me what the interest rates are, I can tell you when we should build the factory.

We’re going to build it.

 

And I mean think we’ll start the initial phases of construction next year.

But I am still somewhat scarred by 2009 when General Motors and Chrysler went bankrupt.

 

While that’s now 14 years ago, it’s -- that is seared into my mind with a branding iron because Tesla was just hanging on by a thread during that entire time and with -- I mean, we closed a financing round in 2008 at 6 p.m.

December 24th, Christmas Eve.

 

And if we had not closed that financing round, we would have bounced payroll two days after Christmas.

So we actually closed that around the last hour, the last day that it was possible, stressful to say the least, and then barely made it through 2009.

 

So, I’m like -- I want to just -- I don’t want to be going at top speed into uncertainty.

A lot of wars going on in the world obviously as well, so -- and we have room here.

 



Unidentified Company Representative

Like in Giga Texas.

 

You said we still have room in this building.

It’s not full with Cybertruck and the line.

 

There’s plenty of growth opportunities still to have inside the building where our team already is.



Elon Musk

We also have 2,000 acres here.

 



Unidentified Company Representative

There’s also…

 



Elon Musk

We’re actually only occupying a tiny corner of the land that we have.

 

We could technically do all the scaling, research just here.

So, personnel is our biggest challenge and the greater Austin area only has -- generously the greater Austin area only has 2 million people.

 

So people are moving here and they’re willing to move here, but there is somewhat of a housing crisis.

They got to live somewhere.

 

So I don’t know.

I mean, I’m just curious.

 

Like I just -- I’m not saying things will be bad.

I’m just saying they might be.

 

And I think like Tesla is an incredibly capable ship, but we need to make sure like as -- if the macroeconomic conditions are stormy, even if the best ship is still going to have tough times, the weaker ships will sink.

We’re not going to sink.

 

But even a great ship in a storm has challenges.

Now that storm will apply to everyone, not just to us and not just to auto industry.

 

It will apply to everyone, I think.

So apart from necessary sort of staples, like food and stuff.

 

So I just -- I don’t know.

If interest rates start coming down, we will accelerate.

 



Martin Viecha

All right.

 



Elon Musk

If anybody’s got any guesses on this, I’d love to be less wrong.

 

And I apologize if I’m perhaps more paranoid than I should be because that might also be the case because I am -- I have PTSD from 2009, big time.

And in 2017 through 2019 were not a picnic either.

 

That was very tough going.

So the auto industry is also somewhat cyclic because people hesitate to buy a new car if there’s uncertainty in the economy.

 

So it’s car companies do very well in good economic times, and they don’t do as well in tough economic times.

So, it’s just -- whereas if somebody is selling bread, then I think that people still eat bread.

 

Yes, we need bread.

We need food all time.

 

But new car, you don’t have to have...



Vaibhav Taneja

Especially if there are wars going on and then that impacts your sentiment.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

I mean people are reading about wars all over the world.

Buying a new car tends to not be front of mind.

 



Martin Viecha

All right.

 

Unfortunately, that’s all the time we have today.

Thank you very much for all of your good questions, and we’ll see you again in three months.

 

Thank you very much.","Operator

All information in this presentation is as of today's date, November 1, 2023.

 

We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Alex.

 



Alex Chriss

Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon.

 

It is a pleasure to speak with you all on today's call, my first as President and CEO of PayPal.

Before I dive in, I'd like to take a moment to thank my predecessor, Dan Schulman, for his diligence and professionalism and handing over the reins and helping me onboard quickly.

 

Additionally, I'm very excited to welcome Jamie Miller to PayPal as the company's next Chief Financial Officer.

Jamie will officially be joining PayPal on November 6.

 

Jamie is a world-class CFO who joins us with decades of experience in both senior finance and operations roles at a number of different Fortune 100 and private companies, including GE and Cargill, and was most recently, CFO of EY.

Jamie is a vital addition to our team.

 

Under Jamie's leadership, I have no doubt that we will drive the financial discipline, necessary efficiencies and operational excellence our company requires.

I look forward to introducing Jamie to you over the coming months and you will also hear from her, of course, on our next earnings call.

 

As excited as we are to welcome Jamie, I also want to take a moment to express my sincere thanks to Gabrielle for all of her hard work, dedication and passion as interim and then acting CFO.

She has helped to drive the company forward and has been instrumental in helping me get up to speed over the past couple of months.

 

I truly appreciate her partnership as well as her commitment to PayPal and look forward to working with her during this next chapter of PayPal's journey.

Okay.

 

Let's jump in.

When I was asked by the Board to take on the CEO role, I was so energized by the possibilities of the impact PayPal can have on the world.

 

I've dedicated the last 19 years of my career to fighting for the underdog, helping consumers and small businesses around the world, achieve their dreams interact with each other and build a better life.

PayPal takes that mission to a whole new level.

 

The assets, the data, the scale and the brand, the full foundation of what PayPal sits on today is unrivaled.

And for me, that is the opportunity of a lifetime.

 

I am also walking in eyes wide open.

There are clearly challenges to tackle.

 

I am someone who speaks plainly and transparently.

If we are doing things well, I will highlight them.

 

If there are things we can do better and need to fix, then I will have no hesitation in calling those out too.

Our innovation activity has accelerated.

 

But we still have work to do on maximizing our impact for our customers and results.

Competition and complexity have increased and the company's focus has not been clear.

 

We are doing a lot of things, but are refocused enough with our resource allocation.

Are we executing with excellence behind the most important work to provide customers with a compelling and differentiated value proposition?

 

Are we partnering with customers in a way that brings them deep value, but also rewards the PayPal shareholder?

These are questions I am maniacally focused on answering with the team and doing a better job of executing across the board.

 

But let me be clear, notwithstanding those realities, this is a growth company with great prospects.

Even within the first month on the job, I'm more energized and have more conviction and clarity than I expected over how we win.

 

We have significant opportunities for growth and impact, the foundation is strong, and the value pools and growth vectors are there.

We must simply execute better and with higher velocity, and we will.

 

I'd now like to share with you all my onboarding process, and what I've learned and observed so far, then I will describe changes you will see going forward, and lastly, I'll set expectations for what you will see from us over the next few quarters.

While I've only been here a little over four weeks, I've been conducting in-depth conversations with internal and external stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners and investors, and diving into the business with our products and go-to-market teams.

 

The feedback has been encouraging, exciting, revealing and very clear.

There are two lenses I've had in synthesizing the input.

 

First, how do we differentiate in solving the most critical customer problems.

Second, what are our unique growth vectors and how do we accelerate our impact for customers and shareholders.

 

Before I run through my thoughts after 30 days, first, let me say, I've been surprised and delighted with how consistent and clear the answers to the previous questions have become.

We are not searching for ideas for tremendous growth.

 

Our assets and our position in the market are incredible.

We know exactly what needs to be done.

 

We simply must execute.

To give you some additional context, here are a few of my initial observations.

 

On our employees.

Our people are kind, caring, dynamic, innovative and engaged.

 

They care deeply about our customers and one another, and are energized by our mission.

My focus is to clearly define our mission, vision and purpose and unleash this team to execute a clearly defined and durable strategy.

 

We will establish and refocus systems and processes to galvanize the entire organization behind our purpose and growth outcomes.

On our customers and innovation, I generally see our customers falling into three categories: consumers; small businesses; and large enterprises.

 

When looking at our customers through this lens, each segment has unique assets and a multitude of growth opportunities.

I've been encouraged by how much innovation our teams are delivering, but we have an opportunity to, a, focus our teams on what's most important to these customers, and, b, package our innovation in a way that is clear and differentiates us in the market.

 

Let me give you some examples.

For consumers, we have not only tremendous breadth, mind share and wallet share of our consumers, but these are active and engaged users.

 

In the U.S.

alone, over 70% of the adult population has use PayPal in the past five years.

 

Let me say that again.

Over 70% of adults in the U.S.

 

have used PayPal in the past five years.

And with the recent launch of our Venmo Teen Account, we are now seeing adoption of our core products and services across the entire addressable market in the U.S.

 

Additionally, we've innovated with unique products and experiences for consumers that each on their own provide tremendous customer benefit.

For example, our PayPal Cashback Mastercard provides 3% cashback on PayPal purchases as well as cashback on all other purchases.

 

Customers with this card make on average 56 more purchases with PayPal in the year after they adopt the product than they did the year before.

Over 25 million consumers have used PayPal Rewards in the past 12 months, and we've put more than $200 million back in our customers' pockets, with cashback and savings during that time.

 

But even more interesting, through our Rewards product, we have an active database of over 300 million SKUs of inventory from our merchant partners.

These data points can help us use AI to power a robust shopping recommendation engine to provide more relevant rewards and savings back to our customers.

 

We've just begun and already rolled-out passkeys to more than 10 million consumers globally to reduce friction in the sign-in experience.

We've added additional security features by providing fraud alerts for all your cards in the PayPal Wallet.

 

We're gaining ubiquity both online and in-person as our PayPal and Venmo branded credit and debit cards can now be added in the Apple and Google Wallets.

And we've launched the first regulated stablecoin by a global payments company in PYUSD, connecting our PayPal and Venmo ecosystems together and creating one of the most robust peer-to-peer networks in the world.

 

Individually, these are each incredible innovations.

But we have not yet brought them altogether into a cohesive, integrated and seamless customer experience and value proposition.

 

As I've said at the beginning, we have brand awareness and reach consumers in most markets around the world.

They know PayPal and they are rooting for us.

 

It is our responsibility to now put together these innovations into a world-class seamless experience.

And that is exactly what we're going to do.

 

As an example, we have refocused our consumer product and go-to-market team to relaunch a brand new end-to-end consumer experience with Checkout at the center, that will bring value to consumers with every single purchase.

We will make it abundantly clear why choose PayPal.

 

This is the first core priority I've asked the teams to focus on.

Next, for small businesses.

 

The core customer problem we can solve is helping them get more customers.

From a breadth and depth perspective, we again have tremendous reach.

 

We serve approximately 35 million merchant accounts and the vast majorities are SMBs.

We have recently launched our new PayPal Complete Payments solution in the market.

 

This solution helps small businesses sell globally and accept a range of payments including PayPal, Venmo and PayPal Pay Later products to help drive checkout.

We provide SMBs the tools to transact globally and are innovating for them with critical services, such as package tracking.

 

Package tracking is now live with over 5,000 merchants on BigCommerce, WooCommerce and UltraCart.

Early results show merchants are experiencing an 80% decrease in item not received disputes, 40% higher dispute wins and 65% faster funds release.

 

This is a good start.

But what really gets me excited is how all of our profile and payment data comes together to empower each of our merchants to improve their conversion rates via our next-generation checkout, while making our consumers checkout experiences more efficient.

 

We just rolled this product out to a handful of pilot merchants.

And with the breadth of our consumer coverage, we are able to identify the majority of consumers that visit a merchant's site.

 

That means we can auto fill payment information for consumers and streamline guest checkout for our merchants.

To serve small businesses with our best-in-class product, we must get PayPal Complete Payments to scale globally.

 

This is the second core priority I've asked our product and go-to-market teams to rally behind.

And you will see us with a concerted push to dramatically improve the end-to-end PayPal Complete Payments product rollout and adoption in the next couple of quarters.

 

Once we've accomplished this, we will have earned the right to expand additional offerings to small businesses.

As someone with deep experience scaling products and services for the small business segment, we have the right to play and win in a number of meaningful and durable businesses that will solve core customer problems and delight our users.

 

Lastly, for our enterprise customers.

We have proven that we can win in the market and take share with Braintree, serving the largest enterprises, such as Adobe, Booking.com, DoorDash, Ticketmaster and Uber.

 

In the last 12 months, we processed over $450 billion in volume out of an estimated $4 trillion to $5 trillion of global large enterprise e-commerce.

That's approximately 10% flowing through us.

 

We now have a beachhead to build upon.

We will address additional customer needs, such as payouts, fraud management, charge-back automation, and FX.

 

These value-added services not only address specific customer pain points, but also help PayPal drive additional margin.

To be clear, our focus here will be continuing to improve performance, provide additional services and expand margin revenue.

 

And lastly, on our company as a whole.

Let me touch briefly on our evolution to operating as a platform company.

 

Our ability to seamlessly delight customers end-to-end is a function of the quality of our technology and data platforms, which are very strong.

But we have a significant and important opportunity to further become a platform company that builds company-wide capabilities, accelerates at scale and drives efficiencies across the organization.

 

Fully unlocking this will accelerate innovation, velocity in the market and value.

Further, our data and scale are key strengths.

 

Our machine learning capabilities combine hundreds of risk and fraud models with dozens of real-time analytics engines and petabytes of payments data to generate insights by learning users' behaviors, relationships, interests and spending habits.

This scale gives us a very unique advantage in the market.

 

Our ability to create meaningful profiles with the help of AI is exceptionally promising.

You will see us using our data and the advances in generative AI in responsible ways to further connect our merchants and consumers together in a tight flywheel.

 

This is essential.

We must build products and customer experiences that are strengthened by our unique two-sided network.

 

Harnessing an end-to-end data platform will help us drive network effects throughout our business.

In order to maximize this opportunity, it will require technology consolidation and automation across the company.

 

Simply put, our cost base remains too high, it is actually slowing us down.

As such, I am in the process of evaluating our most profitable growth priorities and aligning our resources to those priorities.

 

We will become leaner, more efficient and more effective, driving greater velocity, innovation and impact for customers.

To recap my observations and focus areas, our assets and breadth are unrivaled.

 

Our innovation is accelerating and will drive impact.

But we must focus and execute.

 

The weight of the organization will be squarely behind, one, reinventing our consumer experience to drive a clear and durable value proposition with checkout at the center; two, improving and scaling PayPal Complete Payments for small businesses globally; and three, driving margin expansion in Braintree and other products for large enterprises.

Additionally, we will invest in our company-wide platform, driving efficiency and acceleration of innovation, while rightsizing our expenses.

 

Now, I'd like to share what you can expect from me in terms of how we will communicate to all of you and the principles to which we will adhere.

You will see this starting with our next earnings call in terms of how we report our numbers and what we view as important metrics to our shareholders.

 

I believe in the last several years, it has been difficult to model our company consistently, because the company itself hasn't provided consistent metrics to allow you to do so.

That is going to change.

 

For our next earnings call, we will unpack for you the following.

First, we will be clear what our operating principles are and how these principles drive the growth opportunities we pursue and, in turn, drive capital allocation, technology allocation and talent allocation decisions across our business.

 

Second, we will be clear about what metrics matter the most to us and how we are managing the business.

I can tell you right now what I care about most is high-quality customer growth and profitable revenue growth.

 

Going forward, PayPal will be focused on generating real profit for the company.

I can't emphasize that last statement enough.

 

It is key to how I believe this company should be run, and it is how you should expect us to measure our performance.

Unprofitable growth is counterproductive to the long-term prospects of this or any other growth-oriented company.

 

Third, as a management team, we will be guided by margin-accretive revenue growth.

Over time, I believe we have a tremendous opportunity to grow revenue outside of purely transaction-related volume as we continue to serve our customers' core needs.

 

We are taking a closer look at how best to report our financial performance and which KPIs we will be focused on going forward.

Once we complete this review, we will consistently use the same metrics.

 

And it will be easy for you to model the business, judge our performance and hold us accountable.

Next, I want all stakeholders to be able to understand in a simple way how we do what we do and how we make money doing it.

 

This includes our customers as they are the lifeblood of our existence.

Lastly, I am laser-focused on operating leverage and making sure we manage our cost base with relentless attention and commitment.

 

As I've said before, I believe our cost base and complex structure is slowing us down.

We have opportunities to accelerate our revenue growth, while reducing our expenses, helping further drive operating leverage.

 

In terms of the timeline from here.

I can tell you that we are already hard at work, determining a comprehensive plan for 2024 and ensuring we are prepared to delivering.

 

There are teams stacked against the focus areas I mentioned earlier, and they are deep in execution mode.

Our core execution and fast-twitch operating muscles are building by the day.

 

In parallel, the leadership team and I are refreshing our strategic priorities and focus areas for 2024, and we'll be sharing them with you in our next earnings call in February.

I will unpack for you then the clarity of our strategic focus, our focused growth priorities and how we will achieve durable profitable growth, adjustments we will make to drive efficiencies across the organization, and guide what you can expect us to deliver in 2024.

 

It is clear to me that the things we need to do better aren't all going to be achieved overnight.

And, of course, business, like life, is not a straight line.

 

However, I can tell you one thing for sure.

We are going to move at lightning speed to get there as quickly as possible.

 

With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Gabrielle to take you through the Q3 results, and then we would be happy to take some questions.



A - Gabrielle Rabinovitch

Thanks, Alex.

 

It's great to have you on-board.

The past few weeks have been incredibly inspiring and invigorating.

 

There is renewed energy and excitement at PayPal, with you leading us forward.

I look forward to welcoming Jamie and working with you as we enter this new chapter of growth for PayPal.

 

I share Alex's enthusiasm for our increased pace of innovation and the outstanding opportunities we have given the power and scale of our global franchise.

And I agree that with increased focus and improved prioritization, accelerating our growth and delivering operating leverage are mutually reinforcing.

 

Importantly, we're committed to increase transparency and improve consistency in how we discuss our business and the ongoing enhancement of our disclosures.

I would also like to thank the entire PayPal team for their steadfast focus on delivering for our customers and executing our priorities.

 

First, several highlights from the quarter.

We're reporting 9% revenue growth on a currency neutral basis and 20% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share, both of which are ahead of our guidance.

 

In the third quarter, we again demonstrated strong expense discipline and our ability to operate our business with improved efficiencies.

In addition, we continue to make progress in the quarter across our long-term strategic initiatives, which are focused on driving more profitable growth.

 

Moving to our customers.

We're encouraged by new cohorts coming in.

 

Retention and active use based on product innovations are starting to pay off.

That said, during the quarter, active accounts declined by 2.8 million as we continue to flush out low-quality customers, predominantly in Latin America and Southeast Asia.

 

As a reminder, we said this would be a year where we churn off lower-quality actives and, in which, total accounts would decline.

Year-to-date, churn has been lower than our expectations.

 

Customer growth is a vital pillar of our growth agenda.

We're an organization focused on serving our customers and improving our value proposition, and we're positioning ourselves for a return to growth in our customer base.

 

Turning to volume growth.

We're reporting total payment volume of $387.7 billion, representing 15% growth at spot and 13% growth on a currency neutral basis, with that growth primarily driven by Braintree.

 

U.S.

TPV grew 10%.

 

International TPV grew 19% currency neutral, accelerating 5 points sequentially, primarily driven by strength in Europe as well as improvements in Asia.

I would now like to comment on our branded checkout performance.

 

PayPal's global branded checkout volumes grew approximately 6% in the quarter on a currency neutral basis, relative to 7.5% growth in Q3 last year.

Growth accelerated in July to 8%, but moderated as we moved through the quarter.

 

To date in Q4, branded trends have stabilized and are tracking in line with the first half of the year.

As I mentioned, revenue increased 9% on a currency neutral basis and 8% at spot to $7.4 billion.

 

Transaction revenue grew 7% to $6.7 billion, driven by Braintree and PayPal branded checkout.

Hedge gains for the quarter were $7 million, $149 million lower than Q3 last year.

 

In Q3 of last year, we also benefited from approximately $75 million in contractual compensation from merchants, which did not contribute to our revenue this year.

In addition, as we discussed last quarter, migrating and consolidating legacy PayPal payment services was also a drag on the growth in transaction revenue.

 

Other value-added services revenue grew 25% to $764 million, almost entirely driven by increased interest income on customer store balances.

In the third quarter, U.S.

 

revenue grew 7%.

International revenue increased 10% at spot and 11% on a currency neutral basis, accelerating sequentially and year-over-year.

 

As with TPV, we saw strengthening performance across Europe, which was most pronounced in the early to mid-summer, and in China, our seller business improved as well.

Transaction take rate declined 13 basis points to 1.72%.

 

Similar to our Q2 results, approximately 70% of this decline was driven by three factors: lower gains from foreign currency hedges, which are recorded as international transaction revenue; a decline in foreign exchange fees, in part driven by lower currency volatility; and the headwind from lapping elevated contractual compensation from merchants last year.

In addition, the mix of volumes from large merchants continued to pressure our branded checkout take rate.

 

Our total take rate declined 12 basis points to 1.91%, and was affected by the same factors as transaction take rate.

Transaction expense as a rate of TPV came in at 93 basis points, 4 basis points higher than Q3 last year.

 

This increase was primarily driven by Braintree volume growth and was partially offset by the geographic mix of PayPal volumes and rate benefits in Venmo.

Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was 8 basis points for the quarter, flat to last year.

 

Credit losses were $117 million or 3 basis points as a rate of TPV.

In the aggregate, volume-based expenses increased 21% in the third quarter.

 

Consistent with our expectations going into the quarter, Q3 saw a higher level of pressure on transaction margin dollar and rate performance due to several lapping and more transitory factors that we've discussed on past earnings calls.

Transaction margin dollars declined 3.5% to $3.4 billion, and transaction margin declined 558 basis points to 45.4%.

 

In the third quarter, we delivered 540 basis points of operating expense leverage.

Non-transaction related operating expenses declined 12%.

 

We've been actively managing our cost structure.

And in Q3, reductions across each of our principal operating expense categories contributed significant leverage.

 

Non-GAAP operating income grew 8% in the quarter to $1.6 billion.

Our non-GAAP operating margin declined 18 basis points to 22.2%, with operating expense leverage largely offsetting transaction margin compression.

 

For the third quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased 20% to $1.30, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.06.

We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $15 billion.

 

We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, which represents a 30% decline from the third quarter last year.

As a reminder, last quarter, we classified the European installment loans that we intended to sell to KKR as held-for-sale.

 

All loans subsequently originated in this portfolio are also classified as held-for-sale and are reflected as outflows within cash flow from operations.

In Q3, this dynamic reduced free cash flow by $810 million.

 

In future periods, we will recognize the cash from proceeds of sales as an offsetting inflow to cash flow from operations.

Adjusting for this temporary impact, free cash flow grew 21% to $1.9 billion.

 

Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation are competitive differentiators and provide us with significant optionality for value creation.

We have also made progress this year, executing a disciplined approach to capital allocation and managing our balance sheet.

 

In the third quarter, we completed an additional $1.4 billion in share repurchases.

Through September 30, we've now returned $4.4 billion to shareholders.

 

For the full year, we continue to expect to allocate approximately $5 billion to our share repurchase program.

Given our conviction in our business, relative to its valuation today, we've taken a more aggressive approach to our capital return program and have reduced our weighted average shares outstanding by 7% over the last eight quarters.

 

We believe that share repurchase remains an optimal use of capital, allowing us to retain the flexibility to continue investing opportunistically in our business.

In addition, as a result of our decision to sell our European Pay Later receivables to KKR, we ended Q3 with $5 billion in net credit receivables, a 16% decline year-over-year and a 9% decline sequentially.

 

Two weeks ago, we closed on the first step of this commitment, receiving approximately $1.4 billion in proceeds.

Later this month, we will close on the next tranche of our back book sale of credit receivables.

 

We are also maintaining a tightened origination strategy for the PayPal business loans portfolio.

Principal and interest receivables declined nearly 30% in the quarter, and this portfolio now represents approximately 12% of our overall credit receivables portfolio versus 21% 12 months ago.

 

As you heard from Alex, we're evaluating our growth priorities and aligning our resources to accelerate our velocity and [Technical Difficulty] with greater focus, we can be more effective.

Consistent with this approach, we're divesting Happy Returns.

 

In September, we entered into an agreement to sell Happy Returns to UPS for $465 million in cash, meaningfully higher than our acquisition price.

We're thrilled that following a rigorous process over many months, our team was able to find Happy Returns the right long-term home with UPS.

 

This sale, which is expected to close in the current quarter, will enable us to put even more focus on our core business and priorities.

I would now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year.

 

Relative to the plan laid out on our earnings call three months ago, branded checkout growth has been lower than expected.

As I mentioned earlier, after an acceleration in the summer, we've seen a return to growth that is more in line with trends throughout the first half of 2023.

 

We now expect fourth quarter revenue to grow between 7% and 8% on a currency neutral basis or approximately 6% to 7% at spot.

In addition, we expect non-GAAP EPS in Q4 to be approximately $1.36, representing 10% growth relative to 2022.

 

Our guidance contemplates a sequential improvement in transaction margin dollar performance.

That said, on a year-over-year basis, we now expect transaction margin dollars to decline.

 

In addition, we expect our non-GAAP operating margin to contract from the fourth quarter last year.

For 2023, we now expect revenue to grow approximately 8.5% on a currency-neutral basis and approximately 7.5% at spot.

 

The ongoing strength of Braintree volumes in conjunction with lower-than-expected branded checkout trends are resulting in incremental pressure on our non-GAAP operating margin.

Relative to the 100 basis points of expansion previously expected, we now expect approximately 75 basis points of margin expansion.

 

We're slightly increasing our expectations for full year 2023 non-GAAP EPS, which we now expect to be approximately $4.98, representing 21% growth from last year.

This increase reflects the benefit of Q3 outperformance and changes to our tax rate assumption.

 

In addition, we now expect free cash flow for 2023 to be at least $4.6 billion.

In closing, we believe that we're well positioned to navigate the road ahead.

 

As Alex noted in his comments, we're working on our plans to accelerate profitable growth, and we'll share our progress with you along the way with consistency and transparency.

We're committed to building PayPal for the future and guided by our relentless focus on creating the best possible experiences for our customers.

 

Backdrop continues to be complex.

We're taking an appropriately prudent approach to managing our business.

 

And with that, Alex and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from J.P.

 

Morgan.

Please go ahead.

 

Your line is open.



Tien-Tsin Huang

Hey.

 

Thanks so much.

And Alex, appreciate your observations and priorities here.

 

Can you maybe share a little bit more on your early impressions of the assets and the portfolio products at PayPal?

I'm -- just love to hear what surprised to the upside and maybe what assets could require more work to turn around than what you thought?

 

And if -- for example, Happy Returns being sold, as you called out last week, we see more sales, divestitures, replatforming, that kind of thing.

Thank you.

 



Alex Chriss

Yeah.

 

Thank you, Tien-Tsin, and good to hear from you.

It's been exciting to come in.

 

If I would be remiss if I didn't say it wasn't a surprise, but it's delighted me from an asset perspective.

The first I'd highlight is our employee base.

 

This is a tremendous team that is energized, has welcomed me to the team and is fired up to go tackle all the opportunities ahead of us.

If I then think about the different components, I've been really impressed with all the different pieces that we have to deliver for our consumers.

 

We have a ubiquitous platform that's globally recognized with PayPal.

Venmo is a verb, and it's something that is tremendous in the U.S.

 

and has opportunities beyond.

If I think about all the different core problems that we can solve with the assets that we have for customers, Rewards, Buy Now Pay Later, cashback cards, all of those are tremendous and within our grasp.

 

We just, as I mentioned earlier, just have to put them together into a core value proposition, and that's what the team is working towards right now.

On the merchant side, again, we have tremendous penetration into small businesses and enterprises.

 

We have a beachhead now with Braintree, which I'm really excited about.

And I think we've earned the right now to expand margin and make sure that we're really pricing to value and ensuring that we're delivering what we need to across the board.

 

And then, if I really think about the biggest surprise that I didn't realize before coming in is probably around the data.

When we look at the data that we have across this two-sided network, it allows us to do things that I think others just can't.

 

And when I think about how we can personalize branded checkout, how we can recognize people that checkout with our data and create an experience that is frictionless, that is personalized, that drives conversion for our merchants, I think we're just scratching the surface of the opportunity there.

And so, that is a big opportunity that gets me very excited.

 

In terms of opportunities where we have more work, I think you saw it with the Happy Returns divestiture.

And what I would say overall is we have lots of opportunities, but we're doing too many things.

 

We're spread too thin.

And we have an opportunity to focus the organization on what matters the most, on the most impactful opportunities to customers and to growing the business, and we'll be looking at that over time.

 



Tien-Tsin Huang

Great.

 

Thanks, Alex.

Thanks, Gabs.

Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays.

 

Please go ahead.

Your line is open.

 



Ramsey El-Assal

Hi, Alex and Gabrielle.

 

And I appreciate all the clarity you guys provided on your priorities.

You gave us some great detail also on your approach to the SMB side of the business, such as some commentary on PPCP.

 

I guess the question is, given your prior experience with SMBs, do you see SMB becoming a more important part of PayPal's strategy relative to the past?

And I guess which areas of the product or innovation roadmap get you most charged up at this point?

 



Alex Chriss

Yeah.

 

Thank you, Ramsey.

I -- small businesses are a passion of mine.

 

It has been for the last 19 years and it's very personal.

I used to run a small business, and so it's in my DNA and something that not only is important to PayPal and has been in the past, it's really been the lifeblood of the organization.

 

But it absolutely will be a priority going forward.

When I think about small businesses in general, there's two really core customer challenges that the small businesses have.

 

The first is getting customers and growing their business, and the second is managing cash flow.

On the getting customer side, we have a tremendous opportunity with PPCP to help them convert customers, to find customers, to drive new customer acquisition and really help them over time.

 

This is a data play.

It's a ubiquity play.

 

And with our two-sided network, it's where we're focused right now.

Once we do that, I think we earn the right to expand into their second challenge of cash flow.

 

Cash flow was all about money in, money out and access to capital.

We play in all three of those areas.

 

We just have to put together the assets that we have to be able to help small businesses, again, manage their cash flow in a way that helps them grow their business and get past any ups and downs in the market.

So, very excited about small businesses going forward.

 



Ramsey El-Assal

Fantastic.

 

Thank you so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research.

 

Please go ahead.

Your line is open.

 



Darrin Peller

Hey.

 

Thanks, guys.

Alex, congrats again on the new role, and Gabrielle, thanks for everything.

 

Obviously, we know you'll be missed by your investors.

Guys, I know you lowered your outlook a bit for revenue in the fourth quarter, and I think you said you continue to see a decrease in gross profit for fourth quarter.

 

Can you just give us a bit more color on what you're seeing in the environment on e-com, both U.S.

and perhaps globally?

 

And just if anything you're seeing in the trends is what led to a more cautious outlook either on the holidays or anything more broadly?

Thanks, guys.

 



Gabrielle Rabinovitch

Yeah, Darrin.

 

You bet.

Thanks for the question.

 

Overall, I'd say we're seeing very healthy trends in our checkout business.

We're heading into the heart of Q4, and we really see no meaningful shifts in our performance or our demand environment.

 

We have taken an appropriately prudent approach to planning for Q4, and obviously, we've contemplated a range of outcomes.

As you know, headed into Q3, we had expected to see branded checkout accelerate through the back half.

 

Branded did bump up in July.

And as I discussed a few minutes earlier, it moderated through Q3.

 

Overall, we've seen very solid performance in branded.

So, when we think about the sort of what we're seeing in the back half relative to the first half, very consistent performance in global branded checkout.

 

But it's just not as elevated as we planned and that's really what's informing the outlook.



Darrin Peller

Got it.

 

Thanks, Gab.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs.

 

Please go ahead.

Your line is open.

 



Michael Ng

Hey.

 

Good afternoon, and thanks for the question.

First, Alex, congratulations on the new role, and Gabrielle, thanks for everything.

 

I appreciate your comments around managing the cost base and it being too high.

Could you just talk a little bit about how you think about balancing the need for investment versus efficiency?

 

The company previously talked about the opportunity for OpEx to keep declining in the years ahead.

Is that how we should think -- still think about the future?

 

Thanks.



Alex Chriss

Yeah.

 

Thanks, Mike.

First, let me say, as I mentioned earlier, this is a growth company, and we are going to assess the focused priorities where we will invest in growth and we will make sure those are funded for success.

 

And so, I think about that separately, then also being able to manage OpEx.

On the expense side, we have an opportunity to continue to manage OpEx efficiently.

 

We have a lot of acquisitions that we've done over the past few years.

We have a lot of duplication and a lot of manual work that we have an opportunity to invest in automation.

 

We have an opportunity to invest in a platform that allows us to build services that can be reused and leveraged across the organization, which will, again, as I mentioned earlier, actually accelerate us and speed the company up.

So, I think about them differently.

 

We will absolutely invest in growth and make sure that the levers that we have to continue to delight customers and grow the business are funded for success.

And then, we will work on building a platform that drives automation and continues to drive down our cost base.

 



Michael Ng

Great.

 

Thank you for the thoughts.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America.

 

Please go ahead.

Your line is open.

 



Jason Kupferberg

Good afternoon, guys.

 

Alex, welcome.

Gabrielle, best of luck.

 

And I wanted to actually ask about the transaction profit dollar growth.

In Q4, will that year-over-year decline be more or less than it was in Q3?

 

And then, how should we think about the potential for this metric to see improved growth into 2024?

Maybe you can comment on which of the initiatives that are in place to offer more potential than others to move the needle on transaction profit dollar growth next year?

 

Thank you.



Gabrielle Rabinovitch

Yeah.

 

You bet, Jason.

Maybe I'll start.

 

Well, as you heard Alex discussed and I commented on it as well, our focus really is on driving profitable growth.

And we're putting the weight of the organization against initiatives consistent with that objective.

 

That said, we did see a decline in our Q3 transaction margin dollars.

We do expect them to decline again in Q4, but to a lesser extent.

 

So, I really view Q3 as the low point and we'd expect to see an improvement in the profile in Q4.

In addition, obviously, we're not guiding 2024 on this call.

 

Longer-term, our success will, in part, be determined by our ability to reaccelerate profitable growth in the business and we expect to be able to do that.

Alex, anything else you want to add?

 



Alex Chriss

I just -- I want to underscore, I know I've -- I said it in the comments and I just want to underscore it again.

 

We have every opportunity to drive profitable growth.

It's just a focus that -- and a discipline that we will bring to the organization.

 

And so, it will take time.

There will be a sequential performance improvement over a number of quarters.

 

But when we make it the focus of the organization, we have enough levers at our disposal to be able to deliver on that.



Jason Kupferberg

Thank you.

 
Operator

We have time for one more question.

 

James Faucette from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.

Your line is open.

 



James Faucette

Thank you so much for the question.

 

And I want to add my welcome to Alex and thanks to Gabrielle for all the work she's done in the CFO seat.

One of the assets that you talked about within that population of the U.S.

 

is Venmo.

And I'm wondering how you're thinking about expanding its acceptance and kind of the to-dos around that?

 

It seems like it's really important demographically.

You have at least a foothold at Amazon, but expansion of acceptance elsewhere online especially has been pretty slow.

 

So, just wondering how you're thinking about that as part of the asset pool and the to-do list there?

Thanks.

 



Alex Chriss

Yeah.

 

Thank you, James, for the question.

And it is pretty rare to be able to have an asset as powerful as Venmo.

 

When something, again, becomes a verb in language is a tremendous demographic.

And you saw with our launch of Venmo Teen, we continue to expand the opportunity set there.

 

As you mentioned, we're in early stages with Amazon.

That is going well and we expect that both from a customer demand perspective as well as a merchant demand perspective, we will continue to drive acceptance ubiquity for Venmo.

 

I think that is very important for us as well as just driving additional services that our customers are demanding for the Venmo app.

And so, again, we think about providing different services, expanding the opportunity for our customers to be delighted and use Venmo for all aspects of their spending and managing of money.

 

I think we're just, again, scratching the surface of what's possible with an app that is clearly loved in the market and has created viral growth.

So, very excited to accelerate investment there and see where we can take Venmo.

 



James Faucette

Thank you.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

I will now turn the conference over to Alex Chriss for closing remarks.



Alex Chriss

Great.

 

Thank you, Krista.

And thanks, everyone, for joining us today.

 

Hopefully, you can see how serious we are about growing and improving PayPal across the board as quickly as possible.

Before we close, I want to leave you with three thoughts.

 

You've heard in my voice today, both the confidence that we will make this company excel and the determination to do it as quickly and thoroughly as possible.

We have an excellent business, but it needs to execute better and with greater clarity and focus, and it will.

 

We will impact the go-to-market strategy and financial focus of the company in ways that are immediately impactful.

It won't happen overnight, but we will get PayPal to the kind of consistent growth profile we all expect.

 

As I've said it already, but it bears repeating one last time, what I care about is profitable growth.

That is going to be our true north and receive our total focus.

 

I've spent my entire career focusing on making sure we delight our customers and solve their most critical problems, but we must ensure we serve all our stakeholders.

And lastly, our employee base is fired up and motivated to win in the market.

 

In addition, you can also expect us to add additional senior talent to our team, who I believe can help significantly accelerate our growth trajectory.

We are future-proofing this business and we know what needs to be done.

 

We are playing to win.

In the weeks and months ahead, we are going to be moving with velocity to deliver for our customers and our business.

 

I look forward to talking to you all on our next call in February and laying out our clear plan to win.

Thank you, and have a great day.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

 

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call.

This call is being recorded.

 

Your line will be muted for the duration of the call.

We will now go live to the presentation.

 

Please standby.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum, and their Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon.

 

Mr.

Dimon, please go ahead.

 



Jamie Dimon

Hey, good morning, everybody.

 

Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call.

So before we get into the discussion about third-quarter earnings, I just want to say how deeply saddened that we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the resulting bloodshed and more.

 

Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all of our hearts here at JPMorgan Chase go out to all who are suffering.



Jeremy Barnum

Thanks, Jamie, and, of course, I very much echo this sentiment.

 

Now, let's turn to our first-quarter earnings results.

The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.

 

Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $13.2 billion, EPS of $4.33, and revenue of $40.7 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 22%.

These results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of Firmwide legal expense.

 

On Page 2, we have some more detail.

Similar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant.

 

For this quarter, First Republic contributed $2.2 billion of revenue, $858 million of expense, and $1.1 billion of net income.

Now, focusing on the Firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.5 billion was up $5 billion or 15% year-on-year.

 

NII, ex-Markets, was up $4.8 billion or 28%, driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in Card, partially offset by lower deposit balances.

NIR, ex-Markets, was up $374 million or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior year.

 

And Markets revenue was down $190 million or 3% year-on-year.

Expenses of $20.9 billion were up $1.7 billion or 9% year-on-year, primarily driven by ongoing growth and front office and technology staffing, as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense.

 

And credit costs were $1.4 billion, predominantly driven by net charge-offs in Card, and included a $102 million net reserve release, driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by card loan growth.

On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3.

 

We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.3%, up about 50 basis points versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI.

We had $2 billion of net share repurchases this quarter and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III endgame proposal.

 

In line with our capital hierarchy, we will continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge.

And on the topic of the Basel III endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it.

 

So, let's cover that now, starting on Page 4.

Given the significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry as well as households and businesses as end-users, we thought it was important to spend time discussing it.

 

And while we know there is interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular detail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by policymakers that banks are well-capitalized and well-positioned to deal with stress.

Given that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and there's a lot that does not make sense to us.

 

Starting with RWA, we've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by around 30% or $500 billion, which results in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion.

One immediate thing to point out is that at 4.5% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $22.5 billion of additional capital with no change in our systemic risk footprint.

 

We've been on the record for a long time that GSIB was conceptually flawed and miscalibrated originally.

Since implementation, the failure to address economic growth despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this problem at the outset has made matters worse.

 

And now all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA.

Our view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated GSIB buffer constant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges.

 

Another lens on the proposed increases is the introduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the stress capital Buffer.

Although there is limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk capital embedded in the SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose.

 

Once we capitalize for this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by around $30 billion without any change to our portfolio.

Now let's turn to Page 5, which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years.

 

Zooming out from the details of this most recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017.

Since then, SA-CCR and the stress capital buffer have been adopted and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 4.5%.

 

So assuming the Basel III endgame and GSIB proposals are finalized in their current form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point.

This illustrates again how overcalibrated these proposals are and it's not done yet.

 

We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the SCB.

And, of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB clause, it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite future.

 

And aside from those dynamics, there remains the long-standing issue of procyclicality in the overall capital [Technical Difficulty].

We think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here.

 

While it may technically be true that the proposal is Basel compliant, Basel compliant does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements.

Implementing the Basel III endgame consistently with how the Europeans have by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GSIB and SCB would have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary increase in capital requirements.

 

As you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond in a great deal of technical detail.

For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important broader plans about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time.

 

The current proposal exacerbates existing features that discourage beneficial scale and diversification.

If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers.

 

In addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market-making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic changes to the current operation of the US capital markets.

We believe that well-regulated market makers that are committed to deploying capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical building block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets, which is vital to the US economy.

 

So, caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude.

With that, let’s go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 6.

 

Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre-pandemic trends with nominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat year-on-year.

Cash buffers continue to normalize to pre-pandemic levels with lower-income groups normalizing faster.

 

Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic.

CCB reported net income of $5.3 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 19% year-on-year.

 

In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates.

End-of-period deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter.

 

We ranked number one in retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continue to solidify our leadership position in key markets.

Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows as we continue to capture yield-seeking flows from our consumer banking customers.

 

In Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year-on-year given a smaller market.

Originations of $10.3 billion were up slightly quarter-on-quarter, but they remain down 15% year-on-year.

 

Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income.

Card outstandings were up 16% year-on-year due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization [for both] (ph).

 

And in Auto, originations were $10.2 billion, up 36% year-on-year as we saw competitors pull back and regained market share.

Expenses of $8.5 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology.

 

In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, driven by net charge-offs, which were up $720 million year-on-year, predominantly due to continued normalization in Card.

The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card services, primarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending.

 

Next to CIB on page seven.

CIB reported net income of $3.1 billion and revenue of $11.7 billion.

 

Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 6% year-on-year.

IB fees were down 3% year-on-year and ranked number one with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.6%.

 

In advisory, fees were down 10%.

Underwriting fees were up 8% for debt and down 6% directly.

 

In terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeline going into the fourth quarter.

Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half, but year-to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will continue to be a headwind.

 

Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year.

Excluding equity investments, it was up 12%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances.

 

Moving to Markets.

Total revenue was $6.6 billion, down 3% year-on-year against a very strong third quarter last year.

 

Fixed income was up 1%, driven by an increase in financing and trading activity and securitized products, as well as improved performance in credit.

This was predominantly offset by currencies in emerging markets coming off a very strong quarter last year.

 

Equity Markets was down 10%, reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior-year quarter as activity was challenged by lower volatility.

Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances.

 

Expenses of $7.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher legal expense and wage inflation.

Credit costs were net benefit of $185 million, driven by a net reserve release of $230 million, reflecting the impact of net lending activity and net charge-offs of $45 million.

 

Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 8.

Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.7 billion.

 

Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 20% year-on-year with payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, and gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $821 million was up 8% year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume.

Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 15% year-on-year, largely driven by an increase in headcount including front-office and technology investments, as well as higher-volume related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition.

 

Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year, 5% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits as clients opt for higher-yielding alternatives.

Loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter.

 

C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization.

And CRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations of real-estate banking as well as lower pay-off activity.

 

Finally, credit costs were $64 million, including net charge-offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million.

Then to complete our lines of business, AWM, on Page 9.

 

Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pretax margin of 31%.

Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year-on-year as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII deposits.

 

Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 3% year-on-year, driven by continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the JPMorgan Asset Management China and Global Shares acquisitions.

For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by equities.

 

And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $40 billion.

AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 22% year-on-year and client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 21% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels.

 

Finally, loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 5%, driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client inflows.

Turning to Corporate on Page 10.

 

Corporate reported net income of $911 million.

Revenue was $1.5 billion, up $1.8 billion compared to last year.

 

NII was $2 billion, up $1.2 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates, and NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront.

Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year-on-year.

 

To finish, we have the outlook on Page 11.

We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex-Markets to be approximately $88.5 billion and $89 billion, respectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed.

 

Consistent with what we've been saying throughout the year, while we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable.

Our outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion.

 

And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, which excludes legal expense.

Also, remember, this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment.

 

And on Credit, we now expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.5%, mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent balanced growth.

So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results.

 

Throughout the year, we've been pointing out the various sources of significant uncertainty in all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment, deposit reprice and the impact of the Basel III endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past.

But as always, we continue to prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most.

 

And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Please stand by.

Our first question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.

 

You may proceed.



John McDonald

Hi, good morning.

 

Jeremy, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on what you're seeing so far on deposit reprice and migration, what's been better than expected so far on that front?

And how do you see higher for longer rates potentially impacting deposit reprice pressure?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Sure.

 

Thanks, John.

I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters.

 

So as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable.

And we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe with tiering or whatever at some point in the future.

 

And of course, that hasn't happened yet this year.

So that's one factor.

 

In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well.

We're getting -- continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion.

 

And so we're seeing -- the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration, but that's sort of working as we would have hoped.

And so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say.

 

In terms of higher for longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing, both from internal migration and possibly from other effects.

And at the end, as we always say, we're going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment.

 



John McDonald

And just as a follow-up, it seems like you've done some securities repositioning in the last couple of quarters.

 

How are you positioning the balance sheet in terms of cash in the securities portfolio, given your outlook for rates?



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

I think I would say that while we're not predicting higher rates, I'm sure Jamie will have something to say here, we believe in being prepared for it.

And that's been our position for some time.

 

And of course, that's produced good results, and we continue to try to position ourselves.

So neither significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large challenge to the company.

 

So probably at the margin, we're still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates.

But do keep in mind that when modeling the duration of the balance sheet, higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the deposit side.

 

So that can be a factor as well.



John McDonald

Okay.

 

Thanks.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.

You may proceed.

 



Steven Chubak

Hey, good morning.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Hey, Steve.

 



Steven Chubak

Jeremy, I was hoping to just inquire about capital market outlook.

 

You cited improved activity levels in September.

But given persistently higher rates, geopolitical tensions and just poor performance of recent IPOs, how you're thinking about the outlook over the near to medium term?

 

And how are you thinking about just the timing of an inflection in activity?



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah, good question.

 

I mean, as you know, obviously, the current levels in Investment Banking remain quite depressed, certainly relative to the very elevated levels that we saw during the pandemic but even relative to sort of 2019, which is what you might consider the last normal year.

We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing that by the time it happens, you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime.

 

And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated in mix and there are some headwinds, as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit.

And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter.

 

So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum, but obviously, significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds, given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulatory headwinds on that side.



Steven Chubak

Thanks for the color.

 

And just for my follow-up on some of the regulatory commentary you provided, certainly a lot of helpful color on the slide.

So thank you for that.

 

If the proposal were to go through as written, what proportion of the inflation do you believe can be mitigated over time?

And I was also hoping you could provide some context as to the quantum of how you think CECL inclusion could potentially impact the SCB and CCAR.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

Those are all good questions, Steve.

I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front.

 

If I start first with the Basel III endgame proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes, some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks.

But some of them are very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes on the proposal.

 

And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point.

I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is -- you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum.

 

And it's therefore, in some sense, non-optimizable.

So we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed.

 

Also, it depends on your definition of optimization.

There's what I -- sometimes I use the term costless optimization, where it's just technical fixes that don't affect revenue and don't require you to exit businesses.

 

I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past.

But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things.

 

And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that's shareholder value disruptive, but it won't be costless.

A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight, may no longer make sense.

 

Now that's one that we hope will be changed but is tricky because those are very long-duration assets.

So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet.

 

So sorry, a bit of a long answer.

But then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we've got to wait for that one because given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be.

 

We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher.



Steven Chubak

Very helpful color, Jeremy.

 

Thanks for taking my questions.



Jeremy Barnum

Yep.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.

You may proceed.

 



Ebrahim Poonawala

Hey, good morning.

 

Just first question, Jeremy, on credit.

I think you mentioned some of the reserve release was tied to the change in the central scenario.

 

Could you just talk to us, remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed?

And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like, where are you seeing softness either on the consumer or the commercial side?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team.

No, but in all seriousness, I think our US economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with, I think, two quarters of negative 0.5% of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year.

 

And that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth, I think, around 1% for a few quarters into 2024.

So just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted average basis than is in the central case outlook.

 

So that number we’ve sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter.

So it's really not much more complicated than that.

 

We're just kind of following the process.

And I think your other question was, where am I seeing softness in credit.

 

And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere roughly or certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning we continue to see the normalization story play out in consumer more or less exactly as expected.

And then, of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space.

 

You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank.

But the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there.

 



Ebrahim Poonawala

That's helpful.

 

And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel endgame.

Maybe on the philosophical side, I think Jamie was speaking last month said, doesn't -- we don't expect any changes.

 

But at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback.

Is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective?

 

Are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more towards the worst-case outcome play out?

Or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

So I'll let Jamie speak for himself on that point, but our job is to advocate.

We're not going to guess what the sentiment is in Washington.

 

It's a 1,000-page rule proposal as you know.

We've got a big team of very smart people studying it very closely.

 

Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like $1 billion of the Fed and their preamble, they forgot about $1 billion of operational risk RWA.

So it just highlights that there is a possibility or seem to have forgotten.

 

They simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees.

So anyway, the point is it's long, it's complicated, it's technical.

 

We do think there are probably some technical mistakes and they are going to forcefully advocate on all of those.

And while we disagree with a lot of this stuff, these are technical issues that should be, in some sense, resolved technically.

 

And hopefully, they'll listen.



Ebrahim Poonawala

Got it.

 

Thank you.



Jeremy Barnum

Sorry, I'm just getting a correction in the room.

 

I meant to say trillion.



Ebrahim Poonawala

Yeah, no, I got that.

 

I got the trillion dollars.

Yep.

 

[indiscernible] Thank you.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley.

You may proceed.

 



Ryan Kenny

Hey, good morning.

 

I want to dig in on the NII side.

So you raised the 2023 NII markets guidance by $2 billion for this year.

 

So I know your comments in the press release suggests JPMorgan's overearning.

So I just want to triangulate there.

 

What does normalized NII look like?

And do we get to normalize next year or later on?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah, a couple of things.

 

So let me do the timing question first.

So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when it's going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth.

 

So we're just really just trying to remind everyone not bank on the current run rate, which we just don't fundamentally think are sustainable.

You'll be aware that before Investor Day last -- earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like, and we put a sort of mid-70s type number out there.

 

And at Investor Day, we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to push that number up a little bit, although there were some overlaps and so on and so forth.

So anyway, with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of push us for that kind of what does that number now look like, we think it's probably closer to about 80 with all the obvious caveats that this is a guess and we don't know when.

 

But we're just trying to point out that it's a bit lower than the current run rate.



Ryan Kenny

Got it.

 



Jamie Dimon

Inside the company, some people think it will happen sooner, i.e., me.

 

Some people think it will happen later, i.e., Jen and Marianne and Jeremy.



Jeremy Barnum

There was no way that I was in that camp, actually, but I don't know.

 

I'm not sure I have an opinion on it.



Ryan Kenny

And then on the loan growth side, industry loan growth has slowed significantly this year.

 

What demand are you seeing for loan growth across the different categories?

And I know it might be too early to talk about next year, but directionally, how should we think about loan growth, given where we are in the cycle and the higher capital requirements coming?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah, sure.

 

So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year.

So we were seeing very robust loan growth in Card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization of revolving balances.

 

As we look forward, we're still optimistic about that, but it will probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period.

In Auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates.

 

And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now.

And generally, the supply chain situation is better.

 

So that's been supported.

As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted.

 

And I think generally in wholesale, the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment.

So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no lending, we have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth, but in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted.

 

And of course, Home Lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions.

But also, and I think this is true across the board, we will be managing things actively as mentioned in light of Basel III, which may not change originations, but it will change what we retain.

 



Ryan Kenny

Thank you.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

You may proceed.

 



Gerard Cassidy

Good morning, Jeremy.

 

How are you?



Jeremy Barnum

Hey, Gerard.

 



Gerard Cassidy

Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTC number of 22% for the quarter.

 

And when you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex-First Republic ROE in Consumer and Community Banking.

I know you and Jamie have talked about your over-earning on credit, we get that.

 

But in view of all of these fintechs and all these other non-bank competitors that were all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here.

What's the drivers behind an ROE, even when you take that credit over-earning out, what's driving this business profitability at such high levels?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah, Gerard, I'd say a couple of things there.

 

So first, it's not just credit, it's also deposit margin, right?

So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the consumer franchise for all the reasons that we've talked about.

 

But I would also point out, sometimes we don't like the word overearning because right now, customers are happy, and they're doing CDs.

And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to compete effectively really comes back to a decade, two-decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches and the app and all the online services and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise, which drives engagement and customer loyalty.

 

And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent.

The competition is still there, the fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value.

 

And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment means that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.



Gerard Cassidy

Very good.

 

And then as a follow-up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments, you and Jamie, about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side.

Your noninterest-bearing deposits, I think, are around 28% of total deposits, which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic.

 

Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the noninterest-bearing deposits going to interest-bearing or is it just the repricing of interest-bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?



Jeremy Barnum

That’s a good question, Gerard.

 

I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that.

And I'm not sure.

 

I get your question.

It's a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, noninterest-bearing split is the best one to look at this through for a couple of reasons.

 

So first, like between wholesale and retail, we've got some amount of noninterest-bearing in wholesale that's sort of the ECR product, and so you see some dynamics there that play out.

And in consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low rate paid across checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now.

 

But then, of course, even within consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances.

So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings, to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and wholesale.

 

And then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product-level reprice that may or may not happen at the moment in the future.



Gerard Cassidy

Great.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.

You may proceed.

 



Erika Najarian

Hi, good morning.

 

Jeremy, my first question is for you.

Again, sort of maybe re-asking the question a different way.

 

Your new guide for net interest income for this year would imply an exit run-rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter.

As we think about the dynamics in higher for longer, on one hand, your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice.

 

On the other, you've been asked a lot about the deposit dynamics that could continue to creep higher.

How do you think about those puts and takes as we think about that relative to that exit rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

So, Erika, I think the simple answer to your question is those -- I believe that fourth quarter exit number equates to a $90 billion run rate ex-Markets.

And we're kind of saying that…

 



Jamie Dimon

It was [$2.5 billion] (ph).

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yes, it's not what I meant to say.

 



Jamie Dimon

She said $22.9 billion.

 



Jeremy Barnum

I didn't hear that.

 

Okay.

Anyway, so call it $90 billion run rate on an exit rate basis, and we're saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer to $80 billion.

 

So that's one building block.

Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume is a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother.

 

So when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product-level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall.

So it will be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now.

 

And we think we can manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise.

And we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships, and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle.

 

We're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us.



Jamie Dimon

And I would just say quantitative tightening there.

 

That will be a large number, and we don't exactly know the effect where wholesale, consumer -- remember also the Fed has the RRP program, which is also sucking money into the Fed directly reducing deposits.

That's still [$1 trillion, too] (ph).

 



Erika Najarian

Thank you.

 

And my second question is on maybe zooming out on the Basel III endgame impacts.

It's clearly complex, overly complex.

 

And I completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward-looking.

I guess what is not complex is the fact that you generated 75 basis points of CET1 this quarter while your RWAs are down.

 

And I guess my question here is, is that, I understand that we're in the public advocacy process.

I hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital markets.

 

But for JPMorgan, has this changed your natural return profile of 17%?

Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14% when you were at Barclays in September.

 

But at the end of the day, it feels like for your -- for the portfolio managers that own JPMorgan through the cycle, this Basel III endgame really harm your natural earnings power and returns.



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

Okay.

That's a good question, Erika.

 

I think there's a couple of pieces in there.

So let me take the most important piece first, which is the 17% through the cycle target.

 

Are we keeping that or not in light of the Basel III endgame proposal?

So short answer is we're not going to change that number today.

 

But when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, it's not -- you have to start by acknowledging that, that is a major headwind to returns.

In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right?

 

We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator, denominator here.

Okay.

 

So say the numerator doesn't change, if you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number.

I would say that, that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III endgame for a couple of reasons.

 

One is we are hoping for changes.

Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can.

 

And that will be different in consumer and in wholesale.

Some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level.

 

But that hopefully can mitigate some of it.

But of course, the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy, and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending.

 

There may be some opportunities for costless optimization.

I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we surprised ourselves on those points in the past.

 

So we'll see.

And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things, and we may exit things.

 

But I wouldn't necessarily assume that, that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%.

That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder disruptive but not necessarily producing much higher returns if you know what I mean.

 

So that's that.

And then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation, and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements.

 

Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine.

And we're building a lot of capital, and we were managing capital conservatively.

 

And we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do.

But that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impact on the real economy.

 



Erika Najarian

Got it.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.

You may proceed.

 



Glenn Schorr

Hi, thank you.

 

So I very much appreciate the comments in the release on the big picture things of what's going on in the world and the potential impact on markets, on crude market, global trade, everything that you mentioned.

And sadly, agree about the most dangerous time in decades.

 

The question I have is, does it surprise you that markets are hanging in that you yourself have green shoots or still green shoots type of mindset about banking while that's going on?

And then maybe more importantly, if you believe what -- obviously, what you wrote, what are you doing about it?

 

How do you manage yourself conservatively?

How do you prepare for tougher times?

 



Jamie Dimon

Yes.

 

Go ahead, Jeremy.

Do you want to start?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Okay.

 

So I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious.

I mean, there is momentum.

 

I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were.

But obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently.

 

So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here.

We are coming on off a very low base.

 

And so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement.

And of course, the overall economic picture, at least currently, looks solid.

 

The sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening.

So those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution.

 



Jamie Dimon

So I would add caution.

 

There has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system.

And you can't look at -- and of course, it can drive markets and sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but it can't stay like this forever.

 

Between Q2, if you've never had, and how much the fiscal stimulus is going to continue at this rate before you have kind of [indiscernible] kind of factors.

So I just -- I think you have to be very cautious.

 

And of course, the dealer policies, I think, is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with.

How do you prepare the company for that?

 

We do 100 stress tests a week.

And we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems or interest rate problems.

 

But usually, geopolitics presents itself as usually as a deep recession or a mild recession, a recession part of the world or markets going down a lot.

And because markets do well is not a reason ever to say they're going to continue to do well.

 

If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points.

I just -- but my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there.

 

You just got to be very cautious [what you’re] (ph) facing.

And like I said, the other thing about the green shoots regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out with better products and better services, securely, safely and all those things.

 

And that's the ultimate goal.

We know there are going to be bad times.

 

That's not a surprise as there are going to be bad times.

We don't always know how they're coming and where they're coming from, but we keep on serving clients, doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns.

 

That's a slightly different issue at this point.

But we'll deal with that, too, when we figure out what to do.

 



Glenn Schorr

Thank you for all that.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Thanks, Glenn.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

You may proceed.

 



Mike Mayo

Hi.

 

I understand the NII strategy benefited from First Republic asset sensitivity, TD strategy, money in motion.

And I'm curious to how much is the NII increase and the deposit benefits a function of the 67 million digital banking customers.

 

Do you have more digital banking customers and branch customers now?

If you can just refresh that?

 

And then a more general question, I guess, the first one for Jeremy, and the second one for Jamie.

You have record tech spend.

 

What's the benefit of having record tech spend?

If you can kind of mark to market your thoughts there as it relates to AI as it relates to maybe wasted spending, your outlook for next year?

 

And does it really help to be the biggest tech spender of the banking industry?



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

Let me do digital banking, Mike.

I spent some time on this actually a couple of weeks ago.

 

And it's interesting to note the sort of extent to which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts, meaning that we're continuing to increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged.

And it sort of goes back to my prior point about...

 



Jamie Dimon

The percent who are digital-only is much lower than that.

 



Jeremy Barnum

For sure, for sure, which actually links to the broader point that what -- in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current NII story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic, through the cycle, multi-channel, fully engaged customer strategy, which requires a lot of investment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts.

 

So in many ways, you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment, but that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously.

So I guess that's part of the answer.

 

And I guess, your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender.

I just think like it's sort of mandatory right?

 

I mean, we're big and very technology-centric business, and the world is competitive.

And everything is changing.

 

Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot.

And otherwise, we risk getting severely disrupted.

 

So I don't know if Jamie wants to add anything.



Jamie Dimon

And just the competition, we look at it as, it’s Wells.

 

It was coming back, which I'm happy for you guys.

It's obviously [Marcus, it's Apple.

 

It's Chime, it's Dave] (ph).

There’s a lot of people coming up with these businesses in different ways.

 

Some have been quite successful, like Stripe in payments.

And so we want to be very good and very competitive.

 

Some of that tech spending is things which are almost a sine qua non, which is cybersecurity, data center resiliency, regulatory requirements and things like that, which we simply are going to do and be very, very good at to protect the company.



Mike Mayo

As it relates to AI specifically, which is the talk of the town, I guess the consensus among people outside the banking industry is that banks will not win that battle, including JPMorgan.

 

You won't control the front end.

What are you doing with AI to make a difference now?

 

Or is this simply a moonshot?



Jamie Dimon

Well, I don't agree with that statement.

 

Banks have an extraordinary amount of proprietary data in addition to when you do like a large language model, that's public data.

It's looking at everything in the Internet or everything that's ever been published or something like that.

 

But AI is an extraordinarily good tool to use.

We just put a woman who is running at our table.

 

So it's data analytics, AI, et cetera.

And there are multiple types of AI.

 

So we use AI for risk, fraud, marketing, prospecting.

And the management team is getting better and better and say, how can we use data to do a better job to reduce errors, to serve clients better, to have a salesperson have co-pilots.

 

They know why even the clients calling us something like that.

And so we simply have to do it.

 

Does it create opportunity for disruptors to come in?

Yeah, of course.

 

That’s always been true with technology and -- but we'll be quite good at it.



Mike Mayo

And then lastly, I think you had made a mention at a conference about investment spend or tech spend over the next year.

 

Where do you stand on that?



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

No, because you did ask a little bit about the expense outlook for next year.

So I think at the conference, we said I think the consensus was $88 billion, but we're still going through budget process, et cetera, et cetera.

 

So that's still true.

I think we're still kind of in the ballpark, but I would say at the margin, there's going to be a little bit of upward...

 



Jamie Dimon

First Republic too, or no?

 



Jeremy Barnum

This is all now including First Republic.

 

And I think there'll be a little bit of upward pressure on that as we sort of do our usual thing and look at all the opportunities that we see and the investments that we want to make.

So no surprise in that sense that we're going to invest prudently.

 

Nothing dramatic, but probably a little bit of upward pressure on the margin.



Mike Mayo

All right.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.

You may proceed.

 



Jim Mitchell

Hey, good morning.

 

Jeremy, do you think there's any receptivity among regulators regarding the double counting, not only of operational risk, but I think you alluded to this earlier in the Markets business, but there's clearly double counting and market risk in the trading book.

Is there any receptivity?

 



Jamie Dimon

Can I just answer real quickly?

 

We don't really know.

It's a one-sided conversation generally.

 

They say put in your comments.

So everyone's going to put in extensive comments kind of like you heard from Jeremy, and we don't really know.

 

We don't really know what's going on inside the Fed, how many people get involved.

In my view, it's become a very politicized process as opposed to the technical analysis, I think that’s required to do it exactly right.

 

So we'll see.



Jim Mitchell

Okay.

 

And then if it weren't to change, and you talked about the potential impact on liquidity in the Markets business, specifically, is that a JPM pulling out of certain business type of event?

Or is that -- is it more a comment that there'll be fewer providers of liquidity as less scaled players exit?

 

And maybe that's all else equal, a market share gain opportunity for JPMorgan in a smaller business?



Jamie Dimon

I think -- so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think, 60% increase in capital.

 

And if you look at it, you can do that by product, for some products it worth it than for others.

But generally, it's bad across all products.

 

And market make -- but the really important thing is market making is a critical function.

And if you look at the world, only so many large market makers who can make markets for governments, hospitals, cities, schools, states, IMF, World Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone and all those various things to buy and sell for their clients in size, and market makers have a different function than hedge funds.

 

And I don't know what the real intent was with this, this is another one, I think, needs to be really thought through.

What are you trying to accomplish?

 

We do market making quite safe.

We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market [shock] (ph) or something like that.

 

But the other thing about market making, I do agree it could actually force some people out.

It will force lower positions, which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation.

 

And so clients, since they need it so much, there may be consolidation in unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints for the LCR, SLR, capital, et cetera, you will constantly be up against limitations on what you can do.



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

And I think that last point of Jamie's is particularly important because, sure, if you want, you can construct as what I would consider a very optimistic argument that the higher cost of doing business will lead smaller-scale players to exit, and that's a share gain opportunity for us.

But I refer back to the comments about the disincentives to beneficial diversification and scale.

 

Getting bigger, especially in Markets, it's quite expensive from, for example, a GSIB perspective.

And so you wind up kind of hemmed in on all sides, which is one of the reasons why we're sort of highlighting that it does seem like the only way out sometimes when you look at the cumulative effect of everything that's happened in Markets over the last 15 years is a fundamentally very different system.

 

And well, obviously...



Jamie Dimon

Great opportunity for European market makers.

 

I mean, a great opportunity.

Like they can do repo and FX and swaps and credit and stuff with 30% less capital.

 

That is a big difference in that kind of business.



Jim Mitchell

Great.

 

That’s helpful.

Thanks.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our last question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.

Your line is open.

 



Matt O’Connor

Hi, good morning.

 

You talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question, but just how do you think about cost control overall looking at the medium term?

The outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest income, fees might help.

 

But the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple of few years.

So I know you always say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control in the next few years?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework, but in some fundamental sense, we just don't agree with the framework, in the sense that -- and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right?

In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you see these very significant fluctuations in capital markets.

 

We saw that 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control.

And while, of course, there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term, directly sensitive to the revenue environment, and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes.

 

But other things are much more structural.

And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through cycle returns are.

 

So we're always very focused on cost.

You can be rest assured of that.

 

That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle, but they're long-term plays.

And you really shouldn't expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower cost in response to a lower revenue environment, where we didn't balloon the cost when the revenue became, as we've argued, unsustainably high.

 



Matt O’Connor

Yeah.

 

Fair enough.

And then if I could just squeeze in on First Republic.

 

Obviously, the contribution there is coming in at multiples higher than expected.

How do you think about the puts and takes in terms of -- I think there's probably some runoff of loans still to come, but also opportunities to deepen the relationships there?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yeah.

 

So you're right about the contribution and about the runoff of loans and it is notable, the net income, the First Republic-related net income that we printed this quarter.

So the first thing to say is that we don't think that, that First Republic-related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate.

 

Some of the same dynamics that we just talked about, in particular, overearning on deposits or sort of above-normal deposit margins also apply to First Republic franchise to some degree.

So we would expect that to normalize.

 

And probably more significantly, as I think you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull-to-par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition.

And so that's a short-term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters.

 

And yeah, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus.

And I think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing.

 

And yeah, I think, as I said, I think, on the press call, things are going well, arguably a little bit better than we had sort of modeled as part of the acquisition, and we're happy to see that.



Matt O’Connor

Okay.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Block Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call.

 

Today's call is being recorded.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speakers' remarks will be a question-and-answer session.

 

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Nikhil Dixit, Head of Investor Relations.

Please go ahead.

 



Nikhil Dixit

Hi, everyone.

 

Thanks for joining our third quarter 2023 earnings call.

We have Jack and Amrita with us today.

 

We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions.

During Q&A, we will take questions from conference call participants.

 

We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call.

All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed to be forward-looking.

 

These forward-looking statements include discussions of our outlook and guidance, as well as our long-term targets and goals, and we may decide to shift our priorities or move away from these targets and goals at any time.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.

 

Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements.

Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.

 

Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ.

Also note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date.

 

We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.

During this call, we will provide a preliminary estimate of performance for the month of October.

 

This represents our current estimate for October performance as we have not yet finalized our financial statements for the month of October, and our monthly results are not subject to interim review by our auditors.

As a result, actual October results may differ from this estimate and may not be reflective of performance for the full fourth quarter.

 

Moreover, this financial information has been prepared solely on the basis of currently available information by, and is the responsibility of, management.

This preliminary financial information has not been reviewed or audited by our independent public accounting firm.

 

This preliminary financial information is not a comprehensive statement of our financial results for October or the fourth quarter.

Within these remarks, we will also discuss metrics related to our investment framework, including Rule of 40.

 

With Rule of 40, we are evaluating the sum of our gross profit growth and adjusted operating income margins.

Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call.

 

Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the Shareholder Letter, Historical Financial Information spreadsheet, and Investor Day materials on our Investor Relations website.

These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.

 

Finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast on our Investor Relations website.

An audio replay of this call and the transcript for Jack and Amrita's opening remarks will be available on the website shortly.

 

With that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.

One moment.

 

We're just getting Jack to reconnect.



Jack Dorsey

I'm sorry, I was on mute.

 

So, we're going to do something a little bit different this year.

Thank you all for joining us.

 

We wrote -- I wrote a shareholder letter to you all, which you'll find on our website, and we're going to focus our call to maximize questions.

So, we're going to start with Amrita providing more detail into what I wrote, most notably, reaching our Rule of 40 goal in 2026 and authorizing a repurchase of $1 billion in shares to offset a portion of dilution from share-based compensation.

 

If you haven't yet, please read that letter for all the details and what I'm focused on going forward.

And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Amrita.

 



Amrita Ahuja

Thanks, Jack.

 

There are four topics I'd like to cover.

First, our strong performance in the third quarter and increased profitability expectations for the remainder of the year.

 

Second, a preliminary view of 2024 and where we're demonstrating discipline on our investments to drive margin improvement.

Third, our path to achieving Rule of 40 in 2026.

 

And lastly, our capital allocation strategy to deliver value for shareholders.

In the third quarter, gross profit was $1.90 billion, up 21% year-over-year.

 

We delivered our highest-ever quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $477 million, or 25% margin on gross profit.

Adjusted operating income, which as a reminder includes expenses related to stock-based compensation and depreciation, was $90 million and 5% margin on gross profit, compared to $32 million a year ago.

 

Our strong profitability during the quarter demonstrates our focus on efficiency in pursuit of our investment framework.

Cash flow generation has also been strong and improving.

 

Adjusted free cash flow was $427 million in the quarter compared to $88 million in the prior period.

For the last 12 months, adjusted free cash flow was $945 million, up from negative $99 million in the prior period.

 

Let's get into Square and Cash App.

Square generated $899 million in gross profit, up 15% year-over-year.

 

Square GPV grew 11% year-over-year, or 12% on a constant currency basis.

We're committed to serving sellers locally and through our banking products.

 

In the third quarter, we experienced strong growth from our vertical points of sale products with gross profit up 29% year-over-year and our banking products up 20% year-over-year.

Cash App generated $984 million in gross profit, an increase of 27% year-over-year.

 

Looking at the components of the inflows framework, as of September, there were 55 million monthly transacting actives, up 11% year-over-year, with growth driven by our peer-to-peer network.

Inflows per transacting active averaged $1,132 in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year, and relatively stable compared to the first half of the year.

 

Monetization rate, which excludes gross profit contributions from our Buy Now Pay Later platform, was 1.43%, up 8 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by pricing changes over the past year and relatively flat quarter-over-quarter.

Turning to our BNPL platform, which contributed $94 million of gross profit to each of Square and Cash App in the third quarter.

 

GMV from our BNPL platform was $6.7 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 24% year-over-year.

Losses on consumer receivables were 0.84% of GMV, an improvement quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.

 

As Jack noted in his letter, in the fourth quarter, we restructured our commerce efforts, moving our BNPL platform into Cash App, as we believe combining the two ecosystems enables us to provide consumer experiences others can't, especially for commerce.

From a financial reporting perspective moving forward, we will no longer split 50% of our BNPL platform into each of Cash App and Square.

 

Instead, to reflect the recent organizational change, we'll include 100% of our BNPL platform in Cash App's results beginning in the fourth quarter.

During the quarter, we experienced an outage to our services across Block, which impacted both Square and Cash App systems.

 

We know the reliability of our systems is crucial for our customers and are working hard to rebuild trust.

The outage lasted about 15 hours on certain products and we estimate it impacted gross profit by less than 1% during the quarter.

 

Our offline capabilities for Square and Cash App enabled our customers to continue to process some transactions during this time.

Looking ahead, we are accelerating our efforts to expand offline capabilities to all of our Square products, so sellers won't be worried about missing a sale and are prioritizing building our technical infrastructure with greater redundancy and resilience.

 

Turning now to the fourth quarter of 2023.

We are shifting away from monthly trend disclosures in favor of reinstating quarterly and annual gross profit and profit guidance.

 

We expect to continue with this updated approach until we achieve and sustain the Rule of 40.

We expect to deliver between $1.96 billion and $1.98 billion in gross profit or 19% growth at the midpoint.

 

For Square, we expect gross profit growth to improve from the third quarter's 15% growth rate as we lap more favorable comparisons from the prior year, and we get the first full quarter benefit from pricing changes on Square Invoices we implemented in the third quarter.

For the month of October, we estimate Square GPV was up 9% year-over-year.

 

Our growth has moderated due to both GPV per seller and lower contributions from new cohorts of sellers.

We believe GPV per seller has been impacted by macro trends, in discretionary verticals, which continued through October.

 

Although we've achieved positive customer acquisition through the first three quarters of the year, gross profit from seller cohorts onboarded over the past two years are not contributing as much to growth as anticipated, and we're focused on evolving our go-to-market strategy to improve this.

For Cash App, we expect gross profit growth to moderate on a year-over-year basis from the third quarter's 27% as we lap stronger growth from the prior year.

 

We continue to expect all three components of the inflows framework to grow on a year-over-year basis in 2023.

From a product perspective, we've seen particular strengths in Cash App Card and Borrow, as we drive continued growth in our financial services products.

 

While we've experienced softness in growth from Cash for Business accounts and expect Cash App Business GPV to decline in the fourth quarter.

Compared to our prior expectations, growth in the fourth quarter was primarily impacted by expectations for our BNPL platform and, to a lesser extent, Cash App Business GPV and Square GPV.

 

Looking at profitability, we expect to deliver $430 million to $450 million in adjusted EBITDA, and $40 million to $60 million in adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter.

And we are raising our full year 2023 profit guide.

 

We expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.66 billion to $1.68 billion, and adjusted operating income of $205 million to $225 million.

These are increases of $170 million and $190 million, respectively, at the midpoint compared to our prior guide.

 

For the full year 2023, the midpoint of our guidance implies gross profit growth of 24%, and adjusted operating income margins of 3%, leading to Rule of 27 this year.

This reflects meaningful margin expansion in 2023, with the midpoint of our guide reflecting 5 points of adjusted operating income margin improvement and 6 points of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement compared to 2022.

 

Turning now to our path to achieving Rule of 40 in 2026.

As a company, we remain focused on balancing growth and profitability.

 

As we look longer term, we're bringing a renewed focus to efficiency, exercising discipline with our expenses, and thinking critically about how we operate to drive leverage.

We're going to do all this while also focusing on how we can continue strong top-line growth to capture more of our addressable market.

 

We introduced our investment framework at the beginning of the year and, today, we want to provide more context on when and how we expect to reach our goal.

As Jack shared in his Shareholder Letter, we plan to reach Rule of 40 in 2026 with an at least mid-teens gross profit growth and approximately mid-20% adjusted operating income margin.

 

This guidance is based on current trends in our business and does not factor in changes to the macro environment.

As we learn more and trends change, our expected mix of growth and profitability may change over time as well.

 

We will continue to monitor trends as we periodically update this view.

We see a long runway for continued growth ahead, and in our long-term planning, we've refined our priorities for each of our Square and Cash App ecosystems, which are captured in Jack's Shareholder Letter.

 

We believe we are still less than 5% penetrated against our $200 billion total addressable markets, one which we will work to expand over time in a disciplined way with new products and audiences.

In balance with our growth priorities, what you're hearing from us today is a significant commitment to profitability and efficiency across three key initiatives.

 

The first area is through the efficiency of our teams.

As Jack outlined in his letter, we are implementing an absolute cap on the number of people we have at our company.

 

We expect to be a smaller team by the end of 2024 compared to where we are today.

Our cap of 12,000 people compares to our current size of just over 13,000 people as of the end of the third quarter.

 

We believe constraining team size will enable us to be more effective in how we drive performance and service of our customers and accountability on our business strategies.

We expect to reach this cap by the end of 2024 with steps towards this goal throughout the year through a combination of performance management, centralizing teams and functions to reduce duplication, and strict prioritization of our scope, aligned with the priorities outlined in Jack's letter.

 

We expect to hold firm at 12,000 people until we feel the growth of the business has meaningfully outpaced the growth of the company.

With greater constraints on team size, we expect to drive meaningful leverage on stock-based compensation as a percentage of gross profit in the years to come, starting in 2024.

 

Second, we are also in the midst of a broad-based effort to reduce our spend across corporate overhead areas.

We've identified a number of areas where we expect to find savings such as real estate, process improvements using automation, discretionary spend areas like T&E, and certain vendor relationships across software, data, cloud, consultants, and contractors.

 

Third, within our ecosystems, as we've shared in the past, we've been identifying opportunities to continue improving our cost structure as we optimize unit economics and partnerships by leveraging our scale.

Moving to our initial outlook for profitability in 2024, which we expect to be our strongest year of profitability yet.

 

While we are still in the planning process for next year, we expect significant margin expansion as we implement these constraints.

We expect to achieve profitability on a GAAP operating income basis in 2024 and to deliver $875 million in adjusted operating income, up approximately 4 times compared to our 2023 guide.

 

We expect to deliver $2.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA, an increase of more than 40% relative to our 2023 guide, and to deliver strong adjusted free cash flow growth next year as well.

We plan to share more about our gross profit growth expectations for 2024 during our fourth quarter earnings call in February.

 

Lastly, I wanted to touch on capital allocation and our focus on prioritizing shareholder return.

As we progress towards Rule of 40 in the coming years, we expect our margin profile and free cash flow generation to improve, which means we can return more to shareholders over time.

 

Today, we are announcing an initial share repurchase program of $1 billion, which will offset a portion of dilution from share-based compensation and allow us to act opportunistically when we believe our shares are undervalued.

We consider share-based compensation in our financial targets as we measure our progress towards Rule of 40, and we want to be responsible in managing the impact of dilution as our company grows.

 

What you hear from us today is an increased commitment to delivering value to our customers and to our shareholders as we execute on the opportunity ahead of us.

And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.



Tien-Tsin Huang

Hey, thanks so much.

 

Really appreciate the cost discipline comments here.

Jack, question for you.

 

Just with all this cost framework now laid out, do you think there's still room here for innovation and outsized growth that we've come to know from Block for quite some time?

Especially with all the changes and the focus, can we see gross profit growth accelerate between now and 2026?

 

Love to hear your thoughts.

Thanks.

 



Jack Dorsey

Yeah, I think there's even more room for innovation and invention and growth.

 

To be very frank, I believe we're getting in our own way throughout the company.

As I've dug in through both the lens of Square and also our investment framework, I just found a lot of silos, a lot of redundancy, a lot of kind of a lack of desire for teams to work together.

 

So, I think a lot of what's been holding us back is cultural in that we need to reinvest in why we're building an ecosystem of ecosystem model and how powerful that is.

And then number two is around just our structure.

 

We had unclear decision-making throughout the company which led to a lot of slowness especially on the Square side.

So, we've been spending the past few weeks just looking at all of that and looking at all of our intersections with our foundational teams, that's our HR and council and financial teams, and making sure that we approach that work very lightly so that we can focus a lot more on getting products and features to our sellers and to our Cash App customers much, much faster.

 

So, I believe we're about to enter a phase of re-acceleration as we look to really hit our goals in R40.

And I want to maintain that we're looking to really focus on our customer and retaining our customers as well.

 

So that will always be a checkpoint on all the moves that we make and ultimately how we think about shifting and iterating and experimenting much more.



Amrita Ahuja

Tien-Tsin, I'd just add that, in many ways, we think constraints can make us stronger.

 

I think that's what you're hearing from Jack.

And this people cap, the absolute number cap on the number of people we have is meant to address and enable these key decisions around our priorities, around our structures, centralizing teams to reduce redundancies in places, enable faster decision-making with clearer accountability, and help us create higher-performing teams across our ecosystem.

 

We'll release the team size cap constraint when we feel it constrains growth of our customers or our business or when the growth -- when our top-line growth outstrips the growth of these teams.

We're not there today.

 

Our focus also is on cost areas outside of the personnel costs that don't touch customers, such as with corporate overhead.

And we think there's lots of opportunity here to address, to streamline our operations without impacting the customer experience.

 

And then finally, just a word from me on our planning process.

We have more to do.

 

So far, during our planning process, I think we've been appropriately focused on cost efficiency opportunities, but we have so many opportunities from a growth perspective across our ecosystems as well, some of which from a strategic prioritization perspective, Jack outlines in the letter.

So, what you see here with 2026 growth, what we've shared so far really is based on our current run rate trends.

 

And of course, we'll periodically update this as we learn more, whether it's from a macro perspective or based on our own execution and ability to accelerate.

And relative to that current view of at least mid-teens growth, we'd expect Cash App's growth to be slightly above that and Square's growth slightly below.

 

But our focus is on exploring new growth initiatives, and then we'll incorporate those as appropriate into our outlook over time.

We have a history here of unlocking new innovation on products and across new audiences to continue driving outsized growth and we'll continue that work.

 



Tien-Tsin Huang

Great.

 

Thanks for the candid reflection.

Thanks.

 
Operator

We'll take our next question from Timothy Chiodo with UBS.

 



Timothy Chiodo

Great, thank you.

 

I want to touch on some of the local sales efforts and the move up markets for the Square ecosystem.

In the context of the 12,000 headcount cap, do you feel that there is ample room to show meaningful leverage on both product development and G&A, but at the same time, again, leaving that room to really lean into sales and marketing and specifically in building out some of those local in-market sales teams to help drive seller up market?

 



Jack Dorsey

Yeah, I do think there's room.

 

I do think there's a lot of areas that we can make more efficient within Square.

And I think where we've been lacking on the go-to-market is much more experimentation, and experimentation driven by AI tools as well.

 

We put a focus, as you saw in the letter, it's our number three priority is to utilize and grow with AI.

For us, that means increasing the probability of positive outcomes for sales, customer service, which is focused a lot on retention and sales within the ecosystem, and also marketing to make all of those efforts much more efficient in terms of reaching sellers where they are.

 

And it allows us with those efficiencies to experiment a lot more.

So, we made a really good move with verticalization of our sales force.

 

We're going to prioritize two verticals in particular, food and beverage, and also services such as beauty.

They're inherently local.

 

Our strength is in local.

And when we have that in-person strength, whether that be an upmarket seller or a small seller, we can expand our ecosystem through that relationship.

 

So, we're going to continue to focus on that strength.

And then, through all those efficiencies that we create with these new AI tools, we'll continue to roll out to our sales staff, to our support staff, and to marketing.

 

I do believe we can experiment and experiment with new things that we haven't tried yet, such as field sales, and learn from them quickly so we can iterate to really good answers.



Timothy Chiodo

Thank you, Jack.

 
Operator

We'll take our next question from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.

 



Darrin Peller

Hey, thanks, guys.

 

It's great to see the outlook going all the way into the Rule of 40 in '26.

But really for now, we get a lot of questions on the sustainability of your Square, the seller business, really just understanding the drivers to the double-digit growth we hope to see.

 

International verticalization, software services, cross-sell, just give us a sense of what the building blocks are to keep that up to those rates?

And then also just an add-on to that would be to touch on where you see the success.

 

I know, Jack, you alluded to the company's culture working on the ecosystem.

But I guess we'd love to hear more about where you see the success on ecosystem potentially kicking in, where you can see the benefit of that?

 

Thanks, guys.



Jack Dorsey

Yeah.

 

So, I think first and foremost, this goes back to the prioritization that we laid out.

So, my first two weeks with Square, again, running Square was focused on like what are we working on and why, and doing a significant stack rank so that we -- as an organization, we know what's most important, why it's most important, and how it's going to impact.

 

But the platform that we're building is critical, not only for enabling new features that have left us out of the conversation for some sellers and not market sellers, but also to make sure that we're realizing our ecosystem of ecosystem strategy and especially around our third-party developers so that they can continue to build where we've left off and we have more information on what we can partner with and build next as well.

So, the platform is going to be, I believe, a huge unlock for us, and we're going to be seeing a lot of those unlocks next year -- into next year.

 

And then I do believe that the focus on these local efforts, whether that be local merchants, local sales, is going to bear a lot of fruit for us.

We have a very compelling product, but we've been hampered a bit in the past around experimenting with more novel approaches to sales that we see in our competitors.

 

We're removing those constraints so that we can learn much faster and invest more deeply into the things that do actually work.

I think a lot of what's holding us back from a product side is actually onboarding.

 

We still get a pretty significant chunk of sellers from self-serve and those are of all sizes, whether that be going to our website or buying hardware from an Amazon channel, for instance.

And our flow, our onboarding flow, it just takes way too much time, hence, we're taking time away from our sellers completely.

 

So, those will be significant focus areas for us and something that I think we'll provide pretty quick results over the next year.

AI, I talked about in the last question.

 

The final thing I want to point on that really sets us apart is banking.

We have a number of products for sellers within banking out there, and we've seen banking -- we see banking today as more retaining our customers and when someone comes into the Square ecosystem, signing up for a loan or a card, a debit card or credit card or savings account, helps keep them.

 

In the future, we do believe that this will become more and more an acquisition channel for us as well.

And I think it's one of our strongest differentiators.

 

And one I think we'll look back at as being the most proud of.

And we have some pretty unique advantages in how we approach people banking with Square and how we enable sellers and how that ultimately positively reinforces our ecosystem and also the Cash App ecosystem.

 

So, in terms of bringing these ecosystems together, I think the place to look at is going to be commerce.

And the most notable within commerce is how we really bring in local commerce, especially within a Cash App view.

 

That is our superpower.

And I think the world is going to want more local experiences.

 

A lot of retail is becoming more and more monotone on the internet, and people are looking for more unique experiences and that's where we fit in and that's where our strength is, and those connections will be coming to bear more and more -- especially early next year, so you will be able to see something early next year.

And there's an obvious intersection between Cash for Business and also Square.

 

And you can see that potentially as a graduation task, for instance.

But people may want to start simpler and smaller and utilize Cash.

 

And then as they grow, Square is there to grow with them.



Darrin Peller

All right.

 

Very helpful.

Thanks, Jack.

 
Operator

We'll take our next question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.

 



Ramsey El-Assal

Hi.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

And this question dovetails a little bit with a couple of the prior ones, but I wanted to ask about Square Go and the progress you're sort of making connecting consumers to merchants on the platform.

 

If you can kind of talk about the progress you're making on this theme more broadly and what other ways you're exploring to create that sort of consumer demand within the app and ecosystem?



Jack Dorsey

Yeah, I mean, it's great you brought up this question because this is exactly how we're thinking about crossing the two ecosystems between Cash App and Square.

 

So, for those of you who are not aware, Square Go is -- right now focused on services.

It's focused a lot on beauty.

 

It allows you to open up, download an app, on Square Go, open it up in your local city, and this is mainly in the U.S.

right now, and see all the services around you and book an appointment and then get all the information that would be critical for your appointment in real-time.

 

So, we're seeing it as a way to provide discovery, because we've had to start it organically and market it as such and get people to download it.

We have actually seen a very strong start, surprisingly, which points to the intent and the desire.

 

Now, if you imagine what that might look like in a much larger canvas with a much larger audience, such as Cash App, those are the questions that we want to explore more.

And that's where we think our strength really lies is when we look across these ecosystems for the use case specifically that go is going after, which is discovery, hence, discovery of merchants around you and building up a resilient and retentive relationship for a seller and their customer.

 

We think we can amplify that especially with everything that we've learned with Square Go being in the market thus far.



Ramsey El-Assal

Great, thank you.

 
Operator

We'll take our next question from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein.

 



Harshita Rawat

Good afternoon.

 

Jack, I want to ask about Square leadership.

You recently took over the leadership of that business after Alyssa's departure.

 

How you thinking about that going forward?

Are you looking for a replacement for Alyssa, or should we expect you to continue to lead?

 

Thank you.



Jack Dorsey

Thank you for the question.

 

I'm going to lead Square until we hit some milestones.

I want to see a significant return to growth, number one.

 

I want to see us be a lot more innovative and inventive, and I want to see us connect our ecosystems better, not just with Cash, but also with TIDAL and TBD.

TBD is going to enable us to go more global faster, both Square and Cash App.

 

And with TIDAL, we do believe that there's parallels between what a musician faces and what a small seller just starting out faces.

And a lot of the same tools are going to be useful.

 

So I'm thinking about more -- I'm thinking about this more from a milestone perspective.

And I'll know when it's time and when Square is set up in a way that we look to find a dedicated lead.

 

But this move has enabled me to see a lot of the problems, not just within Square, but across the company, and work to fix them very, very quickly.

So, our pace of addressing some of the issues that we've had for quite some time, but maybe ignored, the lack of collaboration between ecosystems, the silos that we built in the past, all those are a thing of the past, and we're immediately moving to something that is much stronger and is going to deliver a whole lot more value for our customers, and everything else will follow from that.

 



Harshita Rawat

Okay.

 

Thank you.
Operator

We'll take our next question from Trevor Williams with Jefferies.

 



Trevor Williams

Great.

 

Thanks a lot.

I wanted to ask on the path forward for Cash App gross profit and the monetization rate specifically.

 

I think within the guidance for Q4, if we back out Afterpay, it looks like it's embedding a pretty big step-up just in the pace of quarter-over-quarter gross profit dollar growth for Cash App.

Amrita, if you could unpack where that improvement is coming from?

 

And then, on the monetization rate, how we should think about its progression over the next year or so?

And if there's anything you're able to share on product pipeline specifically there would be great.

 

Thanks a lot.



Amrita Ahuja

Sure.

 

Thanks for the question.

On monetization rate, what we've said in the past, which we've reiterated today as well, is that we are now lapping some of the pricing adjustments that we made last year.

 

So, we expect to see greater stability in the monetization rate in Q4 relative to Q3.

And as we said from a Q4 guide perspective, we also expect to see a moderation in Cash App's growth rate in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter as we're lapping, again, some of those more difficult comparisons from last year.

 

This is on the back though of strong results in the third quarter with -- if you look across our inflows framework, strong growth across each of the three aspects of Cash App's inflows, whether it's active, which grew 11% year-over-year to 55 million on the back of continued viral growth in our peer-to-peer network mechanisms, or it's inflows per active, which were $1,132 in the quarter, and we're up 8% year-over-year, relatively stable with the first half of the year.

Again, this one is really a factor of both our customers' spending power, as well as their adoption of our products and engagement with our platform.

 

And you see with products like Cash App Card and Cash App Borrow that we've been able to build awareness and deepen engagement with those products over time with now 22 million customers on Cash App Cards and strong spend on a year-over-year basis with Cash App Card as well.

And then thirdly, monetization rate as you know, which was 1.43% in the third quarter and that was up 8 basis points year-over-year, relatively stable from a quarter-over-quarter standpoint, which, as you noted, that monetization rate excludes the gross profit from our BNPL platform.

 

We do expect, as I noted earlier, that monetization rate to stabilize as we lap the pricing changes over the past year.



Trevor Williams

Got it.

 

Thank you.
Operator

We'll take our next question from Alex Markgraff with KBCM.

 



Alex Markgraff

Hey.

 

Thanks for taking my question and all the kind of financial targets provided in the Shareholder Letter.

Outside of the more explicit Rule of 40 targets, just curious, how we should evaluate some of the progress you're making on the product side of things and kind of tying the ecosystem together as you've laid out priorities in the letter.

 

Is there a north star to kind of orient folks around to kind of follow along with that progress?



Jack Dorsey

I think the biggest one to look at is going to be commerce and it's going to be through the lens of Cash App that we spent the past few months looking deeply at the Afterpay integration restructuring, that team moving things to Cash App.

 

Because a lot of the value is going to be created there, especially as we bring commerce opportunities, both internet-based and e-commerce-based to local, right to the surface.

So that's probably going to be the most notable in terms of connecting these ecosystems.

 

And as I mentioned before, the second one will be the intersection between Cash App for Business and the Square ecosystem.

There're some obvious connection points there, especially as Cash App for Business customers grow and how they utilize our tools.

 

And I think a big theme between both ecosystems is going to be around banking use cases, both on the on the Square side and the Cash App side, actually throughout our entire ecosystem and all our business units.

But those would be the three that I'd point to watch.

 



Alex Markgraff

Thanks.

 
Operator

We'll take our next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.

 



Bryan Keane

Hi, good afternoon.

 

Thanks for taking the question.

I guess, Jack, my question is just when you assess the seller volumes, how much do you feel like it's pure economic volume that discretionary spend that's slowing some of the volume versus maybe a competitive pressure from the market that you guys can do a better job at?

 

And then I guess going forward, as the comps get easier, do you factor in a little bit more of an economic slowdown in the fourth quarter if that's in the guidance?

Thank you.

 



Jack Dorsey

I'll take the first part of the question.

 

I do believe that by focusing more on the product or features and also getting to parity on particular verticals especially within food and beverage and services, will unlock a lot more growth.

There's been certain features that just blocked us out of conversations from restaurants, for instance.

 

And a lot of those will be unlocked soon with our focus on the platform.

And I do believe that we can be much smarter and more efficient with our go-to-market.

 

Most importantly, as we've made this move to verticalization, looking for more opportunities to automate through AI, but also to experiment more.

I want to make sure that we're experimenting with things that we had not tried before, smaller scale, so we can see what works, and then make better informed decisions about investing more fully in them.

 

I think there's a lot of room there.

And that of course has to match what we're doing when a seller no matter the size gets to our website, gets to our dashboard, and they find something simple, intuitive, and they, most importantly, find all the other products that we offer them, not just the one that came on board for.

 

So, the combination of that I think gets us back to a place of growth that we'll be very proud of.



Amrita Ahuja

And Bryan, I can help fill in just some of the numbers that we're seeing in real-time and kind of what's embedded in our Q4 guide.

 

So, if we look at Square GPV in the third quarter, we grew 11% year-over-year.

And again, based on our estimates, we believe excluding the impact from the outage, growth would have been more in line with the second quarter's growth rate of 12%.

 

Looking at October, we estimate GPV to grow 9% year-over-year.

This is obviously -- that's lower than our 11% from the third quarter.

 

This primarily driven from the U.S., as international markets have been more stable.

But looking at some of the drivers, if we think about the three high-level components of Square's growth, customer acquisition, churn, and same-store growth.

 

We've seen stability in churn through this period, but ultimately, our growth is moderated due to both same-store growth and lower contribution from new cohorts of customers.

Now we think same-store growth, the slow down there, is relatively in line with broader macro trends across discretionary verticals.

 

And that, as Jack has noted, we have work to do to shift our customer acquisition trends, which the team is laser-focused on.

Just to provide maybe a little bit more granularity on the same store growth, when you look at GPV per seller, this is where we believe the recent moderation we've seen has been macro-related.

 

Processing volumes at existing sellers were lower in the third quarter compared to the prior year.

We believe it's macro-driven as the recent results that track directionally with other third-party spend indicators that we measure when we adjust for our mix of verticals given our greater mix of discretionary spend.

 

For instance, we don't serve grocery or gas as an example.

And in October, we saw broad-based softness in consumer spending trends in those discretionary verticals, food and drink and retail.

 

So, we're watchful here, and these trends are factored into our Q4 guide.

Ultimately, a lot of the work that we're doing to close feature gaps and iterate and experiment and move quickly on our go-to-market is where we expect to see opportunities for growth in the future.

 



Bryan Keane

Great.

 

Thanks for the color.
Operator

We'll take our next question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.

 



James Faucette

Thank you so much.

 

I wanted to follow-up on kind of Cash App and the intention to grow there and provide more of banking-type services per the letter, et cetera.

How do you think about like the life cycle of a typical customer, a, that you're onboarding, and clearly you're able to deliver peer-to-peer, and that seems like the easiest first thing, but then bank card or debit card, but -- and you've got some other products.

 

But walk us through like how you think about the evolution of other products that those customers need and how to evolve with them, and as particularly as they increase their own spending capacity?



Jack Dorsey

Yeah.

 

So, as I said in the letter, Cash App is interesting.

It sits at this intersection of three very distinct use cases, which are financial services, community-based transactions, which is effectively peer-to-peer, as you mentioned, and commerce.

 

And our approach is ultimately to bring these three together in a very seamless way, define an entirely new product category which reinvents banking for customers.

So, a lot of -- what we started obviously was peer-to-peer and it has inherent network effects and that you're receiving money from friends and sending money to families.

 

So, it is inherently social and inherently has this incredible word of mouth factor.

But as you get into it, as you receive money and you see that you can also get a card, that you can use that card in ATM, that you can invest in Bitcoin or stocks, you start seeing it more and more as a bigger part of your financial spend, in your financial activity and financial life.

 

And our goal now, as we mentioned, is to win more of a banking use case relationship with our existing customers.

And what that means is ultimately getting to direct deposit and winning a majority of their direct deposit, because that really indicates that they're seeing this as a financial home for them and they're able to use it in entirely new ways that they weren't be able to in the past.

 

So everything that we've built, again, goes back to this concept of an ecosystem where these tools positively reinforce one another, either through new use cases or through retention or through entirely new features that they can't find elsewhere, and that helps not only drive new customers but also helps us keep them.

I think that as I said before earlier in this call, I think the one that we're really excited about because it is fundamentally new to us is around commerce.

 

And as we really deliver against these three financial services, community-based, peer-to-peer transactions and commerce, we have something that I believe is very, very powerful and very unique in the world and continues to build on our strengths, and lends itself to add strength to our other ecosystems, most notably Square.



Amrita Ahuja

And I'll just add, James, as we see customers taking on more products within our ecosystem, within Cash App, we see a multiplier effect on the amount of inflows that they bring into Cash App.

 

Whether they start as peer-to-peer and then they take on a Cash App Card, maybe they participate on our free stock investing program or Bitcoin investing, and then eventually getting them to direct deposit their paycheck, which is a significant opportunity from a primary banking relationship standpoint.

And that's been a big driver of the growth that we've seen in inflows per transacting active over time as we bring customers greater awareness around the broader set of financial services and commerce products across the ecosystem.

 

What we saw in the third quarter was continued to drive growth in these newer inflow channels.

Customers received more than $8 billion in direct deposits into their Cash App accounts in the third quarter, and more than $2 billion of paper money deposits in the third quarter.

 

Both grew approximately 40% year-over-year, which is nearly 2 times as fast as the growth of overall inflows into Cash App.

So obviously, more opportunity for us to do here as we see the direct deposit attached still in that sort of 10% range to Cash App Card monthly actives through September, although we've obviously continued to grow our Cash App Card attached through this period of time, we think we have an opportunity to improve both attach rates to Cash App Card as well as direct deposit and this broadening ecosystem of financial services products for Cash App.

We'll take our next question from Dan Dolev with Mizuho.

 



Dan Dolev

Hey, guys.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

Maybe more for Jack.

 

I think that the Analyst Day and, obviously, you're very prominent talking about Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is now having a renaissance.

 

What is kind of the role of Bitcoin right now in terms of your vision of connecting the ecosystem, the holy grail, and specifically the Cash App?

I'm really interested in hearing your views on that.

 

Thank you.



Jack Dorsey

The reason we have a focus on Bitcoin is because we believe the internet will have a native currency.

 

We believe the internet needs a native currency to enable micro payments globally.

And we started very simply by providing an exchange for people to buy and sell Bitcoin.

 

But ultimately over time, we do believe there's a significant market and significant opportunity and remittance using Bitcoin.

And that's exactly what TBD is focused on.

 

Not only is it a really incredible business that's quite large, but it enables our other ecosystems, Square and Cash App, to move much faster globally as we build out that functionality and as we build out the primitives we're working on for developers.

So I do -- I believe that Bitcoin will continue to increase in value, not just in monetary value, but in use case value to the world.

 

And I do believe that it will be a big part of the future of commerce.

And since we have such an early lead and understanding on it, we'll be set up for success.

 

We always knew that this was going to be a long-term play and it still will be, but there's no doubt that the internet will have a native currency and there's no doubt right now that Bitcoin is the best candidate for them.

Now, I'll just add, Dan, that -- I'll just add that, obviously, you've heard from us today an increasing focus on not only our aspirations and growth for the business, but also discipline in how we operate our business.

 

And similarly, we'll be disciplined around our Bitcoin initiatives, holding our emerging initiatives to a specific investment envelope and will track progress relative to those key milestones on a recurring basis.



Dan Dolev

Great.

 

Really good results, and I love the long-term vision.

Thank you.

 
Operator

We'll take our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.

 



Jason Kupferberg

Thanks, guys.

 

I wanted to come back to the vertical point of sale in Square.

You had the gross profit of 29% there.

 

Is that growth rate sustainable over the next few quarters?

And I'm curious what percent of Square's total gross profit is now coming from vertical point of sale?

 

And then separately, if you could just make a quick comment on what you're expecting for stock-based comp expense both this year and next year?

Thank you.

 



Amrita Ahuja

So, Jason, I can start.

 

So, in the third quarter, yes, we had a strong growth in our vertical point of sale and developer solutions, where gross profit from our vertical point of sale products across retail, restaurants, and appointments was up 29% year-over-year, and gross profit growth from our developer tools also outpaced overall Square gross profit growth.

As we said last quarter, each of our vertical point of sale products delivered gross profit of over $100 million on an annualized basis during the third quarter as well.

 

And there'll be key pieces of how we optimize our go-to-market strategy, improving onboarding flows and experimenting with new channels.

I won't give you a specific number for vertical point of sale going forward, but we did note that we expect Square gross profit growth from the Q4 perspective to improve relative to Q3, partly because of the more favorable comparisons as well as the full quarter of a pricing movement that we take on -- we took on Square Invoices during the third quarter.

 

And your second question was related to stock-based compensation?



Jason Kupferberg

Right, for 2023 and 2024, just in the context of the AOI targets?

 



Amrita Ahuja

Sure.

 

So, stock-based compensation in the fourth quarter, we expect to be relatively flat relative -- on an absolute dollar basis relative to the third quarter.

And as I said on the call earlier, we expect to drive meaningful leverage on SBC over time starting in 2024.

 

And here we'd measure it as stock-based compensation as a percentage of gross profit as we implement the absolute number cap on the number of people that we have at the company and look to drive operational leverage and efficiencies across our business.

This is a key focus area for us.

 

Obviously, SBC is an important tool for us in how employees, our shareholders align our incentives as owners of the business, but it's one that we're very mindful of and have deliberately included in our financial targets and adjusted operating income to be measuring and watchful of the amount of dilution.

That's also part of the reason that we've got our $1 billion buyback that we've announced today is an intention to offset a portion of dilution moving forward.

 



Jason Kupferberg

Thanks, Amrita.

 
Operator

We'll take our next question from Pete Christensen with Citi.

 



Pete Christensen

Good evening.

 

Thanks for the question.

Jack, I wanted to dig a little bit into the go-to-market on the Square side.

 

Connecting a few dots from earlier questions, conversations, sounds like Square may be more interested in participating with the [ISO] (ph) channel to distribute Square products.

Is that something on the roadmap?

 

Is that something where you've experimented before?

Do you believe that Square needs to embrace the ISO channel more to scale against competitors?

 

Thank you.



Jack Dorsey

We have experimented with it before from a financial partnership perspective.

 

Specifically, we had a partnership with JPMorgan Chase and gave out score readers at all of their branches as a distribution point.

Not [indiscernible].

 

I think the most important thing is like we need to experiment more and we need to experiment with different models.

I think the answer is not going to be generalized, it's going to be specific to the vertical.

 

This looks different in terms of distribution for a restaurant than it does for services and beauty and then that's completely different from retail.

So, I think the most important point to take away is like we want to be open to a lot more experimentation that's on a smaller scale for a bit of time so that we can see what's working and then invest in a much heavier way.

 

We are looking more deeply at just some immediate experiments such as contracts, which we're seeing some early success from some local campaigns, more partnerships and specifically referrals, which we think there's a lot to it.

It kind of hearkens back to our earliest day in terms of how Square spread, which was entirely by word of mouth referrals, helps push that even more.

 

And then, just making sure that we're focused on the experience the sellers have when they get in to the service or when they go to our website.

So those I think are the biggest drivers.

 



Pete Christensen

Thank you.

 

That's helpful.

A lot of good stuff here.

 

Thank you.



Jack Dorsey

Thank you.

 
Operator

And we'll take one more question.

 

And we'll take that question from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.



Andrew Jeffrey

Thanks.

 

I appreciate you sneaking me in here at the end.

Amrita, the Cash App monetization framework has always been really helpful.

 

Could you unpack a little bit sources of monetization within Cash App?

I'm thinking specifically about Instant Deposit versus Interchange, and how that's changed over time?

 

And how you think about the Instant Deposit product in particular in a real-time payments world?



Amrita Ahuja

Sure.

 

Thanks for the question, Andrew.

We've had a growing set of products across Cash App, and some of which are free and some of which are monetized, and have grown the pace of monetization of some of the products outside of Instant Deposit even faster than Instant Deposit.

 

So, the mix of the business relying on Instant Deposit has declined over time, despite the fact that that continues to be a growing product for us and has unique use cases around customer utility.

Of course, our focus is as much as possible delivering value within our ecosystem across a number of products.

 

And that's where you've seen the strong growth of things like Cash App Card with 22 million, 40% attached to our 55 million monthly active base, and where we've seen strong growth from per-active spend perspective, which continues into the third quarter with growth on a year-over-year basis there.

So -- and along with greater utility around obviously peer-to-peer within the broader ecosystem of Cash App, the ability to deposit paper money deposits, the ability to receive your direct deposit, the ability to extract money through an ATM, the ability to invest money, the ability now to save money within Cash App.

 

And all of these provide a greater utility for -- a lot of these inflows that are staying within the Cash App ecosystem are moving throughout the Cash App ecosystem.

Now what we've seen historically when we look outside at other countries where instant rails are available, for instance, in the UK where Square also has an Instant Transfer product, as the attach rate in those areas for that product continue to be strong, and generally about as strong as what we see in the U.S., meaning that people are willing to pay for seamless integrated product experiences that provide them with value.

 

So obviously this is one that we'll continue to watch, but even pleased with the continued growth of Instant Deposit, but even more pleased with the growth of the other products across Cash App.



Andrew Jeffrey

Appreciate that.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Thank you.

 

And that does conclude Block's third quarter earnings call.

Thank you for your participation.

 "
3,2024_Q2,"


Suhasini Chandramouli

Good Afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q2 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

 

My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations.

Today's call is being recorded.

 

Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri.

After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.

 

Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations.

These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast.

 

For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.

 

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.



Tim Cook

Thank you, Suhasini.

 

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call.

Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $90.8 billion and an EPS record of $1.53 for the March quarter.

 

We set revenue records in more than a dozen countries and regions.

These include, among others, March quarter records in Latin-America and the Middle East, as well as Canada, India, Spain and Turkey.

 

We also achieved an all-time revenue record in Indonesia, one of the many markets where we continue to see so much potential.

In services, we set an all-time revenue record, up 14% over the past year.

 

Keep in mind, as we described on the last call, in the March quarter a year-ago, we were able to replenish iPhone channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the December quarter COVID-related supply disruptions on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max.

We estimate this one-time impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter revenue last year.

 

If we remove this from last year's results, our March quarter total company revenue this year would have grown.

Despite this impact, we were still able to deliver the records I described.

 

Of course, this past quarter, we were thrilled to launch Apple Vision Pro and it has been so wonderful to hear from people who now get to experience the magic of spatial computing.

They describe the impossible becoming possible right before their eyes and they share their amazement and their emotions about what they can do now, whether it's reliving their most treasured memories or having a movie theater experience right in their living room.

 

It's also great to see the enthusiasm from the enterprise market.

For example, more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought Apple Vision Pro units and are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren't possible before, and this is just the beginning.

 

Looking ahead, we're getting ready for an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love.

And next month, we have our Worldwide Developers Conference, which has generated enormous enthusiasm from our developers.

 

We can't wait to reveal what we have in-store.

We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in Generative AI.

 

We are making significant investments, and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon.

We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple's silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create.

 

As we push innovation forward, we continue to manage thoughtfully and deliberately through an uneven macroeconomic environment and remain focused on putting our users at the center of everything we do.

Now let's turn to our results for the March quarter across each product category, beginning with iPhone.

 

iPhone revenue for the March quarter was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year.

We faced a difficult compare over the previous year due to the $5 billion impact that I mentioned earlier.

 

However, we still saw growth on iPhone in some markets, including Mainland China, and according to Kantar during the quarter, the two best-selling smartphones in Urban China were the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max.

I was in China recently where I had the chance to meet with developers and creators who are doing remarkable things with iPhone.

 

And just a couple of weeks ago, I visited Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore, where it was incredible to see all the ways customers and communities are using our products and services to do amazing things.

Everywhere I travel, people have such a great affinity for Apple, and it's one of the many reasons I'm so optimistic about the future.

 

Turning to Mac.

March quarter revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% from a year ago.

 

We had an amazing launch in early March with the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air.

The world's most popular laptop is the best consumer laptop for AI with breakthrough performance of the M3 chip and it’s even more powerful neural engine.

 

Whether it's an entrepreneur starting a new business or a college student finishing their degree, users depend on the power and portability of MacBook Air to take them places they couldn't have gone without it.

In iPad, revenue for the March quarter was $5.6 billion, 17% lower year-over-year, due to a difficult compare with the momentum following the launch of M2 iPad Pro and the 10th Generation iPad last fiscal year.

 

iPad continues to stand apart for its versatility, power and performance.

For video editors, music makers and creatives of all kinds, iPad is empowering users to do more than they ever could with a tablet.

 

Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, March quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% from a year-ago due to a difficult launch compare on Watch and AirPods.

Apple Watch is helping runners go the extra mile on their wellness journeys, keeping hikers on course with the latest navigation capabilities in watchOS 10, and enabling users of all fitness levels to live a healthier day.

 

Across our watch lineup, we're harnessing AI and machine-learning to power lifesaving features like a regular rhythm notifications and fall detection.

I often hear about how much these features mean to users and their loved ones and I'm thankful that so many people are able to get help in their time of greatest need.

 

As I shared earlier, we set an all-time revenue record in services with $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year.

We also achieved all-time revenue records across several categories and geographic segments.

 

Audiences are tuning in on screens large, small and spatial and are enjoying Apple TV+ Originals like Palm Royale and Sugar.

And we have some incredible theatrical releases coming this year, including Wolves, which reunites George Clooney and Brad Pitt.

 

Apple TV+ productions continue to be celebrated as major awards contenders.

Since launch, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,100 award nominations and 480 wins.

 

Meanwhile, we're enhancing the live sports experience with a new iPhone app, Apple Sports.

This free app allows fans to follow their favorite teams and leagues with real-time scores, stats and more.

 

Apple Sports is the perfect companion for MLS Season Pass subscribers.

Turning to retail, our stores continued to be vital spaces for connection and innovation.

 

I was delighted to be in Shanghai for the opening of our latest flagship store.

The energy and enthusiasm from our customers was truly something to behold.

 

And across the United States, our incredible retail teams have been sharing Vision Pro demos with customers, delighting them with a profound and emotional experience of using it for the very first time.

Everywhere we operate and everything we do, we're guided by our mission to enrich users' lives and lead the world better than we found it, whether we're making Apple podcasts more accessible with a new transcripts feature or helping to safeguard iMessage users' privacy with new protections that can defend against advances in quantum computing.

 

Our environmental work is another great example of how innovation and our values come together.

As we work toward our goal of being carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030, we are proud of how we've been able to innovate and do more for our customers while taking less from the planet.

 

Since 2015, Apple has cut our overall emissions by more than half, while revenue grew nearly 65% during that same time period.

And we're now using more recycled materials in our products than ever before.

 

Earlier this spring, we launched our first-ever product to use 50% recycled materials with a new M3-powered MacBook Air.

We're also investing in new solar and wind power in the U.S.

 

and Europe, both to power our growing operations and our users' devices.

And we're working with partners in India and the U.S.

 

to replenish 100% of the water we use in places that need it most with the goal of delivering billions of gallons of water benefits over the next two decades.

Through our Restore Fund, Apple has committed $200 million to nature-based carbon removal projects.

 

And last month, we welcomed two supplier partners as new investors, who will together invest up to an additional $80 million in the fund.

Whether we're enriching lives of users across the globe or doing our part to be a force for good in the world, we do everything with a deep sense of purpose at Apple.

 

And I'm proud of the impact we've already made at the halfway point in a year of unprecedented innovation.

I couldn't be more excited for the future we have ahead of us, driven by the imagination and innovation of our teams and the enduring importance of our products and services in people's lives.

 

With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.



Luca Maestri

Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone.

 

Revenue for the March quarter was $90.8 billion, down 4% from last year.

Foreign exchange had a negative year-over-year impact of 140 basis points on our results.

 

Products revenue was $66.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to the challenging compare on iPhone that Tim described earlier, which was partially offset by strength from Mac.

And thanks to our unparalleled customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments.

 

Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year with record performance in both developed and emerging markets.

Company gross margin was 46.6%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix to services, partially offset by leverage.

 

Products gross margin was 36.6%, down 280 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs.

Services gross margin was 74.6%, up 180 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix.

 

Operating expenses of $14.4 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 5% year-over-year.

Net income was $23.6 billion, diluted EPS was $1.53 and a March quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $22.7 billion.

 

Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories.

iPhone revenue was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year, due to the almost $5 billion impact from a year ago that Tim described earlier.

 

Adjusting for this one-time impact, iPhone revenue would be roughly flat to last year.

Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment.

 

And during the March quarter, we saw many iPhone models as the top-selling smartphones around the world.

In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, an iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, Australia, the U.K., France, Germany and Japan.

 

And the iPhone 15 family continues to be very popular with customers.

451 Research recently measured customer satisfaction at 99% in the U.S.

 

Mac revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our new MacBook Air, powered by the M3 chip.

Customers are loving the incredible AI performance of the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models.

 

And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of our MacBook Air buyers during the quarter being new to Mac.

Also customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the U.S.

 

iPad generated $5.6 billion in revenue, down 17% year-over-year.

iPad continued to face a challenging compare against the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation from last year.

 

At the same time, the iPad installed base has continued to grow and is at an all-time high as over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product.

In addition, the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for iPad in the US.

 

Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to a difficult launch compare.

Last year, we had the continued benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro second-generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra.

 

Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch installed base to a new all-time high and customer satisfaction was recently measured at 95% in the U.S.

In services, as I mentioned, total revenue reached an all-time record of $23.9 billion, growing 14% year-over-year with our installed-base of active devices continuing to grow at a nice pace.

 

This provides a strong foundation for the future growth of the services business as we continued to see increased customer engagement with our ecosystem.

Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year.

 

And paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth.

We have well over $1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago.

 

We continued to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from creating new games on Arcade and great new shows on TV+ to launching additional countries and partners for Apple Pay.

Turning to enterprise, our customers continued to invest in Apple products to drive productivity and innovation.

 

We see more and more enterprise customers embracing the Mac.

In Healthcare, Epic Systems, the world's largest electronic medical record provider, recently launched its native app for the Mac, making it easier for healthcare organizations like Emory Health to transition thousands of PCs to the Mac for clinical use.

 

And since the launch of Vision Pro last quarter, many leading enterprise customers have been investing in this amazing new product to bring spatial computing apps and experiences to life.

We are seeing so many compelling use cases from aircraft engine maintenance training at KLM Airlines to real-time team collaboration for racing at Porsche to immersive kitchen design at Lowe's.

 

We couldn't be more excited about the spatial computing opportunity in enterprise.

Taking a quick step back, when we look at our performance during the first-half of our fiscal year, total company revenue was roughly flat to the prior year in spite of having one less week of sales during the period and some foreign exchange headwinds.

 

We were particularly pleased with our strong momentum in emerging markets, as we set first-half revenue records in several countries and regions, including Latin-America, the Middle East, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey.

These results, coupled with double-digit growth in services and strong levels of gross margin, drove a first half diluted EPS record of $3.71, up 9% from last year.

 

Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program.

We ended the quarter with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities.

 

We repaid $3.2 billion in maturing debt and commercial paper was unchanged sequentially, leaving us with total debt of $105 billion.

As a result, net cash was $58 billion at the end of the quarter.

 

During the quarter, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.5 billion through open-market repurchases of $130 million Apple's shares.

Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, our Board has authorized today an additional $110 billion for share repurchases, as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash-neutral over time.

 

We are also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.25 per share of common stock, and we continued to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward as we've done for the last 12 years.

This cash dividend will be payable on May 16, 2024 to shareholders of record as of May 13, 2024.

 

As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call.

The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.

 

We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low-single-digits year-over-year in spite of a foreign exchange headwind of about 2.5 percentage points.

We expect our services business to grow double-digits at a rate similar to the growth we reported for the first-half of the fiscal year.

 

And we expect iPad revenue to grow double-digits.

We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% to -- and 46.5%.

 

We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion.

We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.

 

With that, let's open the call to questions.



Suhasini Chandramouli

Thank you, Luca.

 

We ask that you limit yourself to two questions.

Operator, may we have the first question, please?

 
Operator

Certainly.

 

We will go ahead and take our first question from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs.

Please go ahead.

 



Mike Ng

Hey, good afternoon.

 

Thank you very much for the question.

I have two, first, I'll ask about the June quarter guidance.

 

The revenue outlook for low-single digits growth, I was wondering if you could run through some of the product assumptions, iPhone, like what kind of gives you confidence around that?

And then on the service momentum, what was better than expected in the quarter?

 

And then I just have a quick follow-up.



Luca Maestri

Hey, Mike.

 

It's Luca.

On the outlook, what we said is we expect to grow low-single-digits in total for the company.

 

We expect services to grow double-digits at a rate that is similar to what we've done in the first-half of our fiscal year.

And we've also mentioned that iPad should grow double-digits.

 

This is the color that we're providing for the June quarter.

In services, we've seen a very strong performance across the board.

 

We've mentioned, we've had records in several categories, in several geographic segments.

It's very broad based, our subscription business is going well.

 

Transacting accounts and paid accounts are growing double-digits.

And also we've seen a really strong performance both in developed and emerging markets.

 

So very pleased with the way the services business is going.



Mike Ng

Great.

 

Thank you.

And I wanted to ask about, as Apple leans more into AI and Generative AI, should we expect any changes to the historical CapEx cadence that we've seen in the last few years of about $10 billion to $11 billion per year or any changes to, you know, how we may have historically thought about the split between tooling, data center and facilities?

 

Thank you very much.



Luca Maestri

Yes.

 

We are obviously very excited about the opportunity with Gen AI.

We obviously are pushing very hard on innovation on every front and we've been doing that for many, many years.

 

Just during the last five years, we spent more than a $100 billion in research and development.

As you know, on the CapEx front, we have a bit of a hybrid model where we make some of the investments ourselves.

 

In other cases, we share them with our suppliers and partners on the manufacturing side, we purchased some of the tools and manufacturing equipment.

In some of the cases, our suppliers make the investment.

 

On the -- and we do something similar on the data center side.

We have our own data center capacity and then we use capacity from third parties.

 

It's a model that has worked well for us historically and we plan to continue along the same lines going forward.



Mike Ng

Excellent.

 

Thank you very much.



Suhasini Chandramouli

Awesome.

 

Thank you, Mike.

Operator, can we have the next question, please?

 
Operator

Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.

 

Please go ahead.



Wamsi Mohan

Yes, thank you so much.

 

Tim, can you talk about the implications to Apple from the changes driven by EU DMA?

You've had to open up third-party app stores, clearly disposes some security risks on the one-hand, which can dilute the experience, but also lower payments from developers to Apple.

 

What are you seeing developers choose in these early days and consumers choose in terms of these third-party app stores?

And I have a follow-up.

 



Tim Cook

It's really too early to answer the question.

 

We just implemented in March, as you probably know, in the European Union, the alternate app stores and alternate billing, et cetera.

So we're focused on complying while mitigating the impacts to user privacy and security that you mentioned.

 

And so that's our focus.



Wamsi Mohan

Okay.

 

Thank you, Tim.

And Luca, I was wondering if you could comment a bit on the product gross margins, the sequential step down.

 

You noted both mix and leverage.

Any more color on the mix, if you could share if customers are at all starting to mix down across product lines or is this more a mix across product lines?

 

Just trying to get some color on customer behavior given some of the broader inflationary pressures.

Thank you so much.

 



Luca Maestri

On a sequential basis, yes, we were down.

 

It's primarily the fact that we had a slightly different mix of products than the previous one.

Obviously, leverage plays a big role as we move from the holiday quarter into the -- into, you know, a more typical quarter.

 

So I would say primarily leverage in a different mix of products.

I mean, we haven't seen anything different in terms within the product categories, we haven't seen anything particular.

 



Wamsi Mohan

Thank you so much.

 



Suhasini Chandramouli

Thanks, Wamsi.

 

We'll take the next question, please.
Operator

Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.

 

Please go ahead.



Erik Woodring

Great.

 

Thanks so much for taking my questions.

Maybe my first one, Tim, you've obviously mentioned your excitement around Generative AI multiple times.

 

I'm just curious how Apple is thinking about the different ways in which you can monetize this technology because historically software upgrades haven't been a big factor in driving product cycles.

And so could AI be potentially different?

 

And how could that impact replacement cycles?

Is there any services angle you'd be thinking?

 

Any early color that you can share on that?

And then I have a follow up, please.

 

Thanks.



Tim Cook

I don't want to get in front of our announcements, obviously.

 

I would just say that we see Generative AI as a very key opportunity across our products.

And we believe that we have advantages that set us apart there.

 

And we'll be talking more about it in as we go through the weeks ahead.



Erik Woodring

Okay.

 

Very fair.

Thank you.

 

And then Luca, maybe to just follow up on Wamsi's comments or question.

There's a broad concern about the headwind that rising commodity costs have on your product gross margins.

 

Wondering if you could just clarify for us if we take a step back and look at all of the components and commodities that go into your products kind of collectively, are we -- are you seeing these costs rising?

Are they falling?

 

What tools do you have to try to help and mitigate some rising costs if at all, rising input costs if at all?

Thank you so much.

 



Luca Maestri

Yes.

 

I mean during the last quarter, commodity costs, and in general, component costs have behaved favorably to us.

On the memory front, prices are starting to go up.

 

They've gone up slightly during the March quarter.

But in general, I think it's been a period not only this quarter, but the last several quarters where, you know, commodities have behaved well for us.

 

Commodities going cycles and so there's obviously always that possibility.

Keep in mind that we are starting from a very high level of gross margins.

 

We reported 46.6%, which is something that we haven't seen in our company in decades.

And so we're starting from a good point.

 

As you know, we try to buy ahead when the cycles are favorable to us.

And so we will try to mitigate if there are headwinds.

 

But in general, we feel particularly for this cycle, we are in good shape.



Erik Woodring

Thank you so much.

 



Suhasini Chandramouli

Great.

 

Thank you, Erik.

Operator, we'll take the next question, please.

 
Operator

Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius.

 

Please go ahead.



Ben Reitzes

Hey, thanks for the question.

 

And hey, Tim, I was wondering if I could ask the China question again.

Is there any more color from your visit there that gives you confidence that you've reached a bottom there and that it's turning?

 

And I know you've been -- you've continued to be confident there in the long-term.

Just wondering if there was any color as to when you think that the tide turns there?

 

Thanks a lot.

And I have a follow-up.

 



Tim Cook

Yes, Ben, if you look at our results in Q2 for Greater China, we were down 8%.

 

That's an acceleration from the previous quarter in Q1.

And the primary driver of the acceleration was iPhone.

 

And if you then look at iPhone within Mainland China, we grew on a reported basis.

That's before any kind of normalization for the supply disruption that we mentioned earlier.

 

And if you look at the top-selling smartphones, the Top 2 in Urban China are iPhones.

And while I was there, it was a great visit and we opened a new store in Shanghai and the reception was very warm and highly energetic, and so I left there having a fantastic trip and enjoyed being there.

 

And so I maintain a great view of China in the long-term.

I don't know how each and every quarter goes and each and every week.

 

But over the long haul, I have a very positive viewpoint.



Ben Reitzes

Okay.

 

Hey, thanks, Tim.

And then my follow-up, I want to ask this carefully though.

 

It's a -- there's a fear out there that, you may lose some traffic acquisition revenue.

And I was wondering if you thought AI from big picture and it doesn't have to be on a long-term basis, I mean from a big picture, if AI is an opportunity for you to continue to monetize your mobile real estate, just how you -- how maybe investors can think about that from a big picture, just given that's been one of the concerns that's potentially been an overhang, of course, due to, you know, a lot of the news and the media around some of the legal cases?

 

And I was wondering if there's just a big-picture color you could give that makes us kind of think about it better and your ability to sort of continue to monetize that real estate?

Thanks a lot.

 



Tim Cook

I think AI, Generative AI and AI, both are big opportunities for us across our products.

 

And we'll talk more about it in the coming weeks.

I think there are numerous ways there that are great for us.

 

And we think that we're well-positioned.



Ben Reitzes

Thanks, Tim.

 



Tim Cook

Yes.

 



Suhasini Chandramouli

Thanks, Ben.

 

Can we have the next question, please?
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.

Please go ahead.

 



Krish Sankar

Yes, hi.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

Again, sorry to beat the AI haul.

 

But Tim, I know you don't want to like reveal a lot.

But I'm just kind of curious, because last quarter you spoke about how you're getting traction in enterprise.

 

Is the AI strategy going to be both consumer and enterprise or is it going to be one after the other?

Any color would be helpful?

 

And then, I have a follow-up for Luca.



Tim Cook

Our focus on enterprise has been and you know through the quarter and the quarters that preceded it on selling iPhones and iPads and Macs and we recently added Vision Pro to that.

 

And we're thrilled with what we see there in terms of interest from big companies buying some to explore ways they can use it.

And so I see enormous opportunity in the enterprise.

 

I wouldn't want to cabin that to AI only.

I think there's a great opportunity for us around the world in the enterprise.

 



Krish Sankar

Got it.

 

Very helpful.

And then for Luca, you know, I'm kind of curious on -- given the macro-environment, on the hardware side, are you seeing a bias towards like standard iPhone versus the Pro model?

 

The reason I'm asking the question is that there's a weaker consumer spending environment, yet your services business is still growing and has amazing gross margins.

So I'm just trying to like square the circle over there.

 

Thank you.



Luca Maestri

I'm not sure I fully understand the question, but in general, what we are seeing on the product side, we continued to see a lot of interest at the top of the range of our products.

 

And I think it's a combination of consumers wanting to purchase the best product that we offer in the different categories and our ability to make those purchases more affordable over time.

We've introduced several financing solutions from installment plans to trading programs that reduce the affordability threshold and therefore, customers tend to buy -- want to buy at the top of the range that is very valuable for us in developed markets, but particularly in emerging markets where the affordability issues are more pronounced.

 

But in general, over the last several years and that is also reflected in our gross margins, over the last several years, we've seen this trend, which we think is pretty sustainable.



Krish Sankar

Got it.

 

Thank you very much, Luca, and thanks, Tim.



Suhasini Chandramouli

Thank you, Krish.

 

Operator, we'll have the next question, please.
Operator

Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.

 

Please go ahead.



Amit Daryanani

Thanks for taking my question.

 

I have two as well.

You know, I guess, first off on capital allocation, you folks have about $58 billion of net cash right now.

 

As you think about eventually getting to this net cash-neutral target, do you think at some point, Apple would be open to taking on leverage on the balance sheet and continuing the buyback program?

Or is it more like once you get to this neutral position, it's going to be about returning free cash flow back to shareholders?

 

I'm just wondering, how do you think about leverage on your balance sheet over time and what sort of leverage do you think you'd be comfortable taking on?



Luca Maestri

Hey, Amit.

 

This is Luca.

I would say one step at a time, we have put out this target of getting to net cash-neutral several years ago and we're working very hard to get there.

 

Our free cash flow generation has been very strong over the years, particularly in the last few years.

And so as you've seen this year, we've increased the amount that we're allocating to the buyback.

 

For the last couple of years, we were doing $90 billion, now we're doing $110 billion.

So let's get there first.

 

It's going to take a while still.

And then when we are there, we're going to reassess and see what is the optimal capital structure for the company at that point in time.

 

Obviously, there's going to be a number of considerations that we will need to look at when we get there.



Amit Daryanani

Fair enough.

 

I figure it's worth trying anyway.

If I go back to this China discussion a bit and, you know, Tim, I think your comments around growth in iPhones in Mainland China is really notable.

 

Could you step back, I mean, these numbers are still declining at least Greater China on a year-over-year basis in aggregate.

Maybe just talk about what are you seeing from a macro basis in China and then at least annual decline -- or year-over-year declines that we're seeing.

 

Do you think it's more macro driven or more competitive driven over there?

That would be helpful.

 



Tim Cook

Yes, I can only tell you what we're seeing.

 

And so I don't want to present myself as a economist.

So I'll steer clear of that.

 

From what we saw was an acceleration from Q1, and it was driven by iPhone and iPhone in Mainland China before we adjust for this $5 billion impact that we talked about earlier did grow.

That means the other products didn't fare as well.

 

And so we clearly have work there to do.

I think it has been and is through last quarter, the most competitive market in the world.

 

And I -- so I, you know, wouldn't say anything other than that.

I've said that before, and I believe that it was last quarter as well.

 

And -- but if you step back from the 90-day cycle, what I see is a lot of people moving into the middle class, a -- we try to serve customers very well there and have a lot of happy customers and you can kind of see that in the latest store opening over there.

And so I continue to feel very optimistic.

 



Amit Daryanani

Great.

 

Thank you.



Suhasini Chandramouli

Thanks, Amit.

 

Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator

Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS.

 

Please go ahead.



David Vogt

Great.

 

Thanks guys for taking my question.

I'm going to roll the two together, so you guys have them both.

 

So Luca obviously, I'm trying to parse through the outlook for the June quarter.

And just based on the quick math, it looks like all things being equal, given what you said, the iPhone business is going to be down mid-single-digits again in the June quarter.

 

And if that's the case and maybe this is for Tim obviously, how are you thinking about the competitive landscape in the context of what you just said maybe outside of China and what changes sort of, the consumer demand or receptivity to new devices because we've been in this malaise for a while.

Is it really this AI initiative that a lot of companies are pursuing?

 

And do you think that changes sort of the demand drivers going forward?

Or is it just really more of a timing issue in terms of the replacement cycle is a little bit long in the tooth, and we see a bit of an upgrade cycle at some point, maybe later this year into next year?

 

Thanks.



Tim Cook

I do see a key opportunity, as I've mentioned before with Generative AI with all of our devices or the vast majority of our devices.

 

And so I think that if you look out that that's not within the next quarter or so and we don't guide at the product level, but I'm extremely optimistic.

And so that -- that's kind of how I view it.

 

In terms of the -- I'll let Luca comment on the outlook portion of it.

I think if you step back on iPhone though and you make this adjustment from the previous year, our Q2 results would be flattish on iPhone.

 

And so that's how we performed in Q2.



Luca Maestri

Yes, David, on the outlook, I'll only repeat what we said before, and this is the color that we're providing for the quarter.

 

We do expect to grow in total, low-single-digits.

And we do expect services to grow double-digits, and we expect iPad to grow double-digits for the rest.

 

I'll let you make assumptions and then we will report three months from now.



David Vogt

Great.

 

Thanks guys.

I'll get back in the queue.

 



Suhasini Chandramouli

Thanks, David.

 

Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator

Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

 

Please go ahead.



Samik Chatterjee

Hi, thanks for taking my question, and I have a couple as well.

 

Maybe for the first one, your services growth accelerated from 11% growth to 14%.

If you can sort of dig into the drivers of where or which parts of services did you really see that acceleration?

 

And why it isn't a bit more sustainable as we think about the next quarter?

Because I believe you're guiding more to sort of averaging out the first half of the year for the next quarter.

 

So just curious what were the drivers and why not have it a bit more sustainably sort of improve as we go through the remainder of the year?

And I have a quick follow-up.

 

Thank you.



Luca Maestri

So a number of things on services.

 

First of all, the overall performance was very strong.

As I said earlier, all-time records in both developed and emerging markets.

 

So we see our services do well across the world.

Records in many of our services categories.

 

There are some categories that are growing very fast also because they are relatively smaller in the scheme of our services business like cloud, video, payment services.

You know, those all set all-time revenue records.

 

And so we feel very good about the progress that we're making in services.

As we go forward, I'll just point out that if you look at our growth rates a year ago, they improved during the course of the fiscal year last year.

 

So the comps for the services business become a bit more challenging as we go through the year.

But in general, as I mentioned, we still expect to grow double-digits in the June quarter at a rate that is very similar to what we've done in the first half.

 



Samik Chatterjee

Got it.

 

Got it.

And for my follow up, if I can ask you more specifically about the India market.

 

Obviously, you continue to make new records in terms of revenue in that market.

How much of the momentum you're seeing would you associate with your sort of retail strategy in that market, retail expansion relative to maybe some of the supply change or the sort of manufacturing changes or strategy you've undergone or taken in that market itself.

 

Any thoughts around that would be helpful?



Tim Cook

Sure.

 

We did grow strong double-digit.

And so we were very, very pleased about it.

 

It was a new March quarter revenue record for us.

As you know, as I've said before, I see it as an incredibly exciting market and it's a major focus for us.

 

In terms of the operational side or supply chain side, we are producing there, from a pragmatic point of view, you need to produce there to be competitive.

And so yes, there the two things are linked from that point of view.

 

But we have both operational things going on and we have go-to-market, and initiatives going on.

We just opened a couple of stores as last year, as you know, and we see enormous opportunity there.

 

We're continuing to expand our channels, and also working on the developer ecosystem as well.

And we've been very pleased that there is a rapidly-growing base of developers there.

 

And so, we're working all of the entire ecosystem from developer to the market to operations, the whole thing.

And I just -- I could not be more excited and enthusiastic about it.

 



Samik Chatterjee

Got it.

 

Thank you.

Thanks for that.

 



Tim Cook

Yes.

 



Suhasini Chandramouli

Thank you, Samik.

 

Operator, we'll have the next question, please.
Operator

Our next question is from.

 

Please go ahead.



Aaron Rakers

Yes, thanks for taking the questions, and I think I have to have two as well like everybody else.

 

I guess, I'm going to go back to the China question.

I guess, at a high level, the simple question is, when we look at the data points that have been repeatedly reported throughout the course of this quarter, I'm curious, Tim, you know, what are we missing?

 

Like where do you think people are missing, Apple's iPhone traction within the China market, just at a high level, you know, given the data points that were reported throughout this course of the last quarter?



Tim Cook

I can't address the data points.

 

I can only address what our results are.

And we did accelerate last quarter, and the iPhone grew in Mainland China.

 

So that's what the results were.

I can't bridge to numbers we didn't come up with.

 



Aaron Rakers

Okay.

 

And then as a quick follow-up, I know you guys haven't talked about this, you know, quantified it in quite some time.

But I'm curious how we would characterize the channel inventory dynamics for iPhone?

 



Tim Cook

Sure.

 

The -- for the March quarter, we decreased channel inventory during the quarter.

We usually decreased channel inventory during the Q2 timeframe.

 

So that's not unusual.

And we're very comfortable with the overall channel inventory.

 



Aaron Rakers

Thank you.

 



Tim Cook

Yes.

 



Suhasini Chandramouli

Thank you, Aaron.

 

Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator

Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.

 

Please go ahead.



Richard Kramer

Thanks very much.

 

I'm not going to ask about China, but you regularly call out all the rapid growth in many other emerging markets.

So is Apple approaching a point where all of those other emerging markets in aggregate might crossover to become larger than your current $70 billion Greater China segments, and maybe investors could look at that for driving growth for the wider business?

 

And then I have a follow-up for Luca.

Thanks.

 



Luca Maestri

I think, Richard, you're asking a really interesting question.

 

We were looking at something similar recently.

Obviously, China is by far the largest emerging market that we have.

 

But when we started looking at places like India, like Saudi, like Mexico, Turkey, of course, Brazil and Mexico and Indonesia, the numbers are getting large, and we're very happy because these are markets where our market share is low, the populations are large and growing.

And our products are really making a lot of progress with the -- in those markets.

 

The level of excitement for the brand is very high.

Tim was in Southeast Asia recently, and the level of excitement is incredibly high.

 

So it is very good for us.

And then -- and certainly, the numbers are getting larger all the time.

 

And so the gap as you compare it to the numbers in China is reducing, and hopefully, that trajectory continues for a long time.



Richard Kramer

Okay.

 

And then as a follow-up, maybe for either of you, I mean, you're coming up on four years from what was incredibly popular iPhone 12 cycle.

And, you know, given you're struggling to reduce your net -- your -- reach your net neutral cash position and your margins are sort of near highs, do you see ways to deploy capital more to spur replacement demand in your installed base either with greater device financing, more investment in marketing, more promotions.

 

I mean, do you feel like you needed to produce those sort of margins or is it a more important to spur growth with replacement?

Thanks.

 



Tim Cook

I think innovation spurs the upgrade cycle, and as one thing, of course, there's economic factors as well that play in there.

 

And what kind of offerings there are from our carrier partners and so forth.

And so there's a number of variables in there.

 

But we work all of those, and you know, we price our products for the value that we're delivering.

And so that's how we look at it.

 



Luca Maestri

And if I can add to Tim's comments, Richard, one of the things that when you look over the long arc of time that maybe is not fully understood is that we've gone through a long period of very strong dollar.

 

And what that means given that our company sells more than 60% of our revenue is outside the United States.

The demand for our products in those markets is stronger than the results that we report just because of the translation of those local currencies into dollars, right?

 

And so that is something to keep in mind as you look at our results, right?

And so we are making all the investments that are needed and Tim has talked about innovation.

 

Obviously, we made a lot of progress with financing solutions, with trading programs and so on, and we will continue to make all those investments.



Richard Kramer

Okay.

 

Super.

Thanks, guys.

 



Suhasini Chandramouli

Thank you, Richard.

 

Operator, can we take our last question, please.
Operator

Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.

 

Please go ahead.



Atif Malik

Hi.

 

Thank you for taking my questions, and I have two questions as well.

First for Tim, for enterprise, specifically, what are some of the top two or three use cases on Vision Pro you're hearing most excitement?

 

And then I have a follow-up for Luca.



Tim Cook

Yes, the great thing is, I'm hearing about so many of them.

 

I wouldn't say that one has emerged as the top, right now.

The most impressive thing is that similar to the way people use a Mac, you use it for everything.

 

People are using it for many different things in enterprise, and that varies from field service to training to healthcare related things like preparing a doctor for pre-op surgery or advanced imaging.

And so the -- it commands control centers.

 

And so it's an enormous number of different verticals.

And you know our focus is on -- is growing that ecosystem and getting more apps and more and more enterprises engaged.

 

And the event that we had recently, I can't overstate the enthusiasm in the room.

It was extraordinary.

 

And so we're off to a good start, I think, with the enterprise.



Atif Malik

Great.

 

And then Luca, I believe you mentioned that for the March quarter, the commodity pricing environment was favorable.

Can you talk about what you're assuming for commodity pricing on memory and et cetera for the June quarter and maybe for the full-year?

 



Luca Maestri

Yes, we provide guidance just for the current quarter.

 

So I'll tell you about the, you know, the guidance.

We're guiding to again to a very high level of gross margins, 45.5% to 46.5%.

 

Within that guidance, we expect memory to be a slight headwind, not a very large one, but a slight headwind.

And the same applies for foreign exchange.

 

Foreign exchange will have a negative impact sequentially of about 30 basis points.



Atif Malik

Thank you.

 



Suhasini Chandramouli

And with that, let me turn the call over to Colette.

 



Colette Kress

Thanks, Simona.

 

We had an exceptional quarter.

Record Q2 revenue of $13.51 billion was up 88% sequentially and up 101% year-on-year, and above our outlook of $11 billion.

 

Let me first start with Data Center.

Record revenue of $10.32 billion was up 141% sequentially and up 171% year-on-year.

 

Data Center compute revenue nearly tripled year-on-year, driven primarily by accelerating demand from cloud service providers and large consumer Internet companies for HGX platform, the engine of generative AI and large language models.

Major companies, including AWS, Google Cloud, Meta, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud as well as a growing number of GPU cloud providers are deploying, in volume, HGX systems based on our Hopper and Ampere architecture Tensor Core GPUs.

 

Networking revenue almost doubled year-on-year, driven by our end-to-end InfiniBand networking platform, the gold standard for AI.

There is tremendous demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI platforms.

 

Our supply partners have been exceptional in ramping capacity to support our needs.

Our data center supply chain, including HGX with 35,000 parts and highly complex networking has been built up over the past decade.

 

We have also developed and qualified additional capacity and suppliers for key steps in the manufacturing process such as [indiscernible] packaging.

We expect supply to increase each quarter through next year.

 

By geography, data center growth was strongest in the U.S.

as customers direct their capital investments to AI and accelerated computing.

 

China demand was within the historical range of 20% to 25% of our Data Center revenue, including compute and networking solutions.

At this time, let me take a moment to address recent reports on the potential for increased regulations on our exports to China.

 

We believe the current regulation is achieving the intended results.

Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our Data Center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact to our financial results.

 

However, over the long term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our Data Center GPUs to China, if implemented, will result in a permanent loss and opportunity for the U.S.

industry to compete and lead in one of the world's largest markets.

 

Our cloud service providers drove exceptional strong demand for HGX systems in the quarter, as they undertake a generational transition to upgrade their data center infrastructure for the new era of accelerated computing and AI.

The NVIDIA HGX platform is culminating of nearly two decades of full stack innovation across silicon, systems, interconnects, networking, software and algorithms.

 

Instances powered by the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs are now generally available at AWS, Microsoft Azure and several GPU cloud providers, with others on the way shortly.

Consumer Internet companies also drove the very strong demand.

 

Their investments in data center infrastructure purpose-built for AI are already generating significant returns.

For example, Meta, recently highlighted that since launching Reels, AI recommendations have driven a more than 24% increase in time spent on Instagram.

 

Enterprises are also racing to deploy generative AI, driving strong consumption of NVIDIA powered instances in the cloud as well as demand for on-premise infrastructure.

Whether we serve customers in the cloud or on-prem through partners or direct, their applications can run seamlessly on NVIDIA AI enterprise software with access to our acceleration libraries, pre-trained models and APIs.

 

We announced a partnership with Snowflake to provide enterprises with accelerated path to create customized generative AI applications using their own proprietary data, all securely within the Snowflake Data Cloud.

With the NVIDIA NeMo platform for developing large language models, enterprises will be able to make custom LLMs for advanced AI services, including chatbot, search and summarization, right from the Snowflake Data Cloud.

 

Virtually, every industry can benefit from generative AI.

For example, AI Copilot such as those just announced by Microsoft can boost the productivity of over 1 billion office workers and tens of millions of software engineers.

 

Billions of professionals in legal services, sales, customer support and education will be available to leverage AI systems trained in their field.

AI Copilot and assistants are set to create new multi-hundred billion dollar market opportunities for our customers.

 

We are seeing some of the earliest applications of generative AI in marketing, media and entertainment.

WPP, the world's largest marketing and communication services organization, is developing a content engine using NVIDIA Omniverse to enable artists and designers to integrate generative AI into 3D content creation.

 

WPP designers can create images from text prompts while responsibly trained generative AI tools and content from NVIDIA partners such as Adobe and Getty Images using NVIDIA Picasso, a foundry for custom generative AI models for visual design.

Visual content provider Shutterstock is also using NVIDIA Picasso to build tools and services that enables users to create 3D scene background with the help of generative AI.

 

We've partnered with ServiceNow and Accenture to launch the AI Lighthouse program, fast tracking the development of enterprise AI capabilities.

AI Lighthouse unites the ServiceNow enterprise automation platform and engine with NVIDIA accelerated computing and with Accenture consulting and deployment services.

 

We are collaborating also with Hugging Face to simplify the creation of new and custom AI models for enterprises.

Hugging Face will offer a new service for enterprises to train and tune advanced AI models powered by NVIDIA HGX cloud.

 

And just yesterday, VMware and NVIDIA announced a major new enterprise offering called VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA, a fully integrated platform featuring AI software and accelerated computing from NVIDIA with multi-cloud software for enterprises running VMware.

VMware's hundreds of thousands of enterprise customers will have access to the infrastructure, AI and cloud management software needed to customize models and run generative AI applications such as intelligent chatbot, assistants, search and summarization.

 

We also announced new NVIDIA AI enterprise-ready servers featuring the new NVIDIA L40S GPU built for the industry standard data center server ecosystem and BlueField-3 DPU data center infrastructure processor.

L40S is not limited by [indiscernible] supply and is shipping to the world's leading server system makers (ph).

 

L40S is a universal data center processor designed for high volume data center standing out to accelerate the most compute-intensive applications, including AI training and inventing through the designing, visualization, video processing and NVIDIA Omniverse industrial digitalization.

NVIDIA AI enterprise ready servers are fully optimized for VMware, Cloud Foundation and Private AI Foundation.

 

Nearly 100 configurations of NVIDIA AI enterprise ready servers will soon be available from the world's leading enterprise IT computing companies, including Dell, HP and Lenovo.

The GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip which combines our ARM-based Grace CPU with Hopper GPU entered full production and will be available this quarter in OEM servers.

 

It is also shipping to multiple supercomputing customers, including Atmos (ph), National Labs and the Swiss National Computing Center.

And NVIDIA and SoftBank are collaborating on a platform based on GH200 for generative AI and 5G/6G applications.

 

The second generation version of our Grace Hopper Superchip with the latest HBM3e memory will be available in Q2 of calendar 2024.

We announced the DGX GH200, a new class of large memory AI supercomputer for giant AI language model, recommendator systems and data analytics.

 

This is the first use of the new NVIDIA [indiscernible] switch system, enabling all of its 256 Grace Hopper Superchips to work together as one, a huge jump compared to our prior generation connecting just eight GPUs over [indiscernible].

DGX GH200 systems are expected to be available by the end of the year, Google Cloud, Meta and Microsoft among the first to gain access.

 

Strong networking growth was driven primarily by InfiniBand infrastructure to connect HGX GPU systems.

Thanks to its end-to-end optimization and in-network computing capabilities, InfiniBand delivers more than double the performance of traditional Ethernet for AI.

 

For billions of dollar AI infrastructures, the value from the increased throughput of InfiniBand is worth hundreds of [indiscernible] and pays for the network.

In addition, only InfiniBand can scale to hundreds of thousands of GPUs.

 

It is the network of choice for leading AI practitioners.

For Ethernet-based cloud data centers that seek to optimize their AI performance, we announced NVIDIA Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform designed to optimize Ethernet for AI workloads.

 

Spectrum-X couples the Spectrum or Ethernet switch with the BlueField-3 DPU, achieving 1.5x better overall AI performance and power efficiency versus traditional Ethernet.

BlueField-3 DPU is a major success.

 

It is in qualification with major OEMs and ramping across multiple CSPs and consumer Internet companies.

Now moving to gaming.

 

Gaming revenue of $2.49 billion was up 11% sequentially and 22% year-on-year.

Growth was fueled by GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for laptops and desktop.

 

End customer demand was solid and consistent with seasonality.

We believe global end demand has returned to growth after last year's slowdown.

 

We have a large upgrade opportunity ahead of us.

Just 47% of our installed base have upgraded to RTX and about 20% of the GPU with an RTX 3060 or higher performance.

 

Laptop GPUs posted strong growth in the key back-to-school season, led by RTX 4060 GPUs.

NVIDIA's GPU-powered laptops have gained in popularity, and their shipments are now outpacing desktop GPUs from several regions around the world.

 

This is likely to shift the reality of our overall gaming revenue a bit, with Q2 and Q3 as the stronger quarters of the year, reflecting the back-to-school and holiday build schedules for laptops.

In desktop, we launched the GeForce RTX 4060 and the GeForce RTX 4060 TI GPUs, bringing the Ada Lovelace architecture down to price points as low as $299.

 

The ecosystem of RTX and DLSS games continue to expand.

35 new games added to DLSS support, including blockbusters such as Diablo IV and Baldur’s Gate 3.

 

There's now over 330 RTX accelerated games and apps.

We are bringing generative AI to gaming.

 

At COMPUTEX, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine or ACE for games, a custom AI model foundry service.

Developers can use this service to bring intelligence to non-player characters.

 

And it harnesses a number of NVIDIA Omniverse and AI technologies, including NeMo, Riva and Audio2Face.

Now moving to Professional Visualization.

 

Revenue of $375 million was up 28% sequentially and down 24% year-on-year.

The Ada architecture ramp drove strong growth in Q2, rolling out initially in laptop workstations with a refresh of desktop workstations coming in Q3.

 

These will include powerful new RTX systems with up to 4 NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs, providing more than 5,800 teraflops of AI performance and 192 gigabytes of GPU memory.

They can be configured with NVIDIA AI enterprise or NVIDIA Omniverse inside.

 

We also announced three new desktop workstation GPUs based on the Ada generation.

The NVIDIA RTX 5000, 4500 and 4000, offering up to 2x the RT core throughput and up to 2x faster AI training performance compared to the previous generation.

 

In addition to traditional workloads such as 3D design and content creation, new workloads in generative AI, large language model development and data science are expanding the opportunity in pro visualization for our RTX technology.

One of the key themes in Jensen's keynote [indiscernible] earlier this month was the conversion of graphics and AI.

 

This is where NVIDIA Omniverse is positioned.

Omniverse is OpenUSD's native platform.

 

OpenUSD is a universal interchange that is quickly becoming the standard for the 3D world, much like HTML is the universal language for the 2D [indiscernible].

Together, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, Pixar and NVIDIA form the Alliance for OpenUSD.

 

Our mission is to accelerate OpenUSD's development and adoption.

We announced new and upcoming Omniverse cloud APIs, including RunUSD and ChatUSD to bring generative AI to OpenUSD workload.

 

Moving to automotive.

Revenue was $253 million, down 15% sequentially and up 15% year-on-year.

 

Solid year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving platforms based on [indiscernible] or associated with a number of new energy vehicle makers.

The sequential decline reflects lower overall automotive demand, particularly in China.

 

We announced a partnership with MediaTek to bring drivers and passengers new experiences inside the car.

MediaTek will develop automotive SoCs and integrate a new product line of NVIDIA's GPU chiplet.

 

The partnership covers a wide range of vehicle segments from luxury to entry level.

Moving to the rest of the P&L.

 

GAAP gross margins expanded to 70.1% and non-GAAP gross margin to 71.2%, driven by higher data center sales.

Our Data Center products include a significant amount of software and complexity, which is also helping drive our gross margin.

 

Sequential GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 5%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefits.

We returned approximately $3.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends.

 

Our Board of Directors has just approved an additional $25 billion in stock repurchases to add to our remaining $4 billion of authorization as of the end of Q2.

Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

 

Demand for our Data Center platform where AI is tremendous and broad-based across industries on customers.

Our demand visibility extends into next year.

 

Our supply over the next several quarters will continue to ramp as we lower cycle times and work with our supply partners to add capacity.

Additionally, the new L40S GPU will help address the growing demand for many types of workloads from cloud to enterprise.

 

For Q3, total revenue is expected to be $16 billion, plus or minus 2%.

We expect sequential growth to be driven largely by Data Center with gaming and ProViz also contributing.

 

GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.5% and 72.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.

GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.95 billion and $2 billion, respectively.

 

GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $100 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments.

GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.

 

Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.

In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community.

 

We will attend the Jefferies Tech Summit on August 30 in Chicago, the Goldman Sachs Conference on September 5 in San Francisco, the Evercore Semiconductor Conference on September 6 as well as the Citi Tech Conference on September 7, both in New York.

And the BofA Virtual AI conference on September 11.

 

Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Tuesday, November 21.

Operator, we will now open the call for questions.

 

Could you please poll for questions for us?

Thank you.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen.

Your line is now open.

 



Matt Ramsay

Yes.

 

Thank you very much.

Good afternoon.

 

Obviously, remarkable results.

Jensen, I wanted to ask a question of you regarding the really quickly emerging application of large model inference.

 

So I think it's pretty well understood by the majority of investors that you guys have very much a lockdown share of the training market.

A lot of the smaller market -- smaller model inference workloads have been done on ASICs or CPUs in the past.

 

And with many of these GPT and other really large models, there's this new workload that's accelerating super-duper quickly on large model inference.

And I think your Grace Hopper Superchip products and others are pretty well aligned for that.

 

But could you maybe talk to us about how you're seeing the inference market segment between small model inference and large model inference and how your product portfolio is positioned for that?

Thanks.

 



Jensen Huang

Yeah.

 

Thanks a lot.

So let's take a quick step back.

 

These large language models are fairly -- are pretty phenomenal.

It does several things, of course.

 

It has the ability to understand unstructured language.

But at its core, what it has learned is the structure of human language.

 

And it has encoded or within it -- compressed within it a large amount of human knowledge that it has learned by the corpuses that it studied.

What happens is, you create these large language models and you create as large as you can, and then you derive from it smaller versions of the model, essentially teacher-student models.

 

It's a process called distillation.

And so when you see these smaller models, it's very likely the case that they were derived from or distilled from or learned from larger models, just as you have professors and teachers and students and so on and so forth.

 

And you're going to see this going forward.

And so you start from a very large model and it has a large amount of generality and generalization and what's called zero-shot capability.

 

And so for a lot of applications and questions or skills that you haven't trained it specifically on, these large language models miraculously has the capability to perform them.

That's what makes it so magical.

 

On the other hand, you would like to have these capabilities in all kinds of computing devices, and so what you do is you distill them down.

These smaller models might have excellent capabilities on a particular skill, but they don't generalize as well.

 

They don't have what is called as good zero-shot capabilities.

And so they all have their own unique capabilities, but you start from very large models.

 
Operator

Okay.

 

Next, we'll go to Vivek Arya with BofA Securities.

Your line is now open.

 



Vivek Arya

Thank you.

 

Just had a quick clarification and a question.

Colette, if you could please clarify how much incremental supply do you expect to come online in the next year?

 

You think it's up 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%?

So just any sense of how much supply because you said it's growing every quarter.

 

And then Jensen, the question for you is, when we look at the overall hyperscaler spending, that buy is not really growing that much.

So what is giving you the confidence that they can continue to carve out more of that pie for generative AI?

 

Just give us your sense of how sustainable is this demand as we look over the next one to two years?

So if I take your implied Q3 outlook of Data Center, $12 billion, $13 billion, what does that say about how many servers are already AI accelerated?

 

Where is that going?

So just give some confidence that the growth that you are seeing is sustainable into the next one to two years.

 



Colette Kress

So thanks for that question regarding our supply.

 

Yes, we do expect to continue increasing ramping our supply over the next quarters as well as into next fiscal year.

In terms of percent, it's not something that we have here.

 

It is a work across so many different suppliers, so many different parts of building an HGX and many of our other new products that are coming to market.

But we are very pleased with both the support that we have with our suppliers and the long time that we have spent with them improving their supply.

 



Jensen Huang

The world has something along the lines of about $1 trillion worth of data centers installed, in the cloud, in enterprise and otherwise.

 

And that $1 trillion of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI.

We're seeing two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time.

 

One is accelerated computing.

And the reason for that is because it's the most cost-effective, most energy effective and the most performant way of doing computing now.

 

So what you're seeing, and then all of a sudden, enabled by generative AI, enabled by accelerated compute and generative AI came along.

And this incredible application now gives everyone two reasons to transition to do a platform shift from general purpose computing, the classical way of doing computing, to this new way of doing computing, accelerated computing.

 

It's about $1 trillion worth of data centers, call it, $0.25 trillion of capital spend each year.

You're seeing the data centers around the world are taking that capital spend and focusing it on the two most important trends of computing today, accelerated computing and generative AI.

 

And so I think this is not a near-term thing.

This is a long-term industry transition and we're seeing these two platform shifts happening at the same time.

 
Operator

Next, we go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.

 

Your line is open.



Stacy Rasgon

Hi, guys.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

I was wondering, Colette, if you could tell me like how much of Data Center in the quarter, maybe even the guide is like systems versus GPU, like DGX versus just the H100?

 

What I'm really trying to get at is, how much is like pricing or content or however you want to define that [indiscernible] versus units actually driving the growth going forward.

Can you give us any color around that?

 



Colette Kress

Sure, Stacy.

 

Let me help.

Within the quarter, our HGX systems were a very significant part of our Data Center as well as our Data Center growth that we had seen.

 

Those systems include our HGX of our Hopper architecture, but also our Ampere architecture.

Yes, we are still selling both of these architectures in the market.

 

Now when you think about that, what does that mean from both the systems as a unit, of course, is growing quite substantially, and that is driving in terms of the revenue increases.

So both of these things are the drivers of the revenue inside Data Center.

 

Our DGXs are always a portion of additional systems that we will sell.

Those are great opportunities for enterprise customers and many other different types of customers that we're seeing even in our consumer Internet companies.

 

The importance there is also coming together with software that we sell with our DGXs, but that's a portion of our sales that we're doing.

The rest of the GPUs, we have new GPUs coming to market that we talk about the L40S, and they will add continued growth going forward.

 

But again, the largest driver of our revenue within this last quarter was definitely the HGX system.



Jensen Huang

And Stacy, if I could just add something.

 

You say it’s H100 and I know you know what your mental image in your mind.

But the H100 is 35,000 parts, 70 pounds, nearly 1 trillion transistors in combination.

 

Takes a robot to build – well, many robots to build because it’s 70 pounds to lift.

And it takes a supercomputer to test a supercomputer.

 

And so these things are technology marvels, and the manufacturing of them is really intensive.

And so I think we call it H100 as if it’s a chip that comes off of a fab, but H100s go out really as HGXs sent to the world’s hyperscalers and they’re really, really quite large system components, if you will.

 
Operator

Next, we go to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.

 

Your line is now open.



Mark Lipacis

Hi.

 

Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the success.

Jensen, it seems like a key part of the success -- your success in the market is delivering the software ecosystem along with the chip and the hardware platform.

 

And I had a two-part question on this.

I was wondering if you could just help us understand the evolution of your software ecosystem, the critical elements.

 

And is there a way to quantify your lead on this dimension like how many person years you've invested in building it?

And then part two, I was wondering if you would care to share with us your view on the -- what percentage of the value of the NVIDIA platform is hardware differentiation versus software differentiation?

 

Thank you.



A – Jensen Huang

Yeah, Mark, I really appreciate the question.

 

Let me see if I could use some metrics, so we have a run time called AI Enterprise.

This is one part of our software stack.

 

And this is, if you will, the run time that just about every company uses for the end-to-end of machine learning from data processing, the training of any model that you like to do on any framework you'd like to do, the inference and the deployment, the scaling it out into a data center.

It could be a scale-out for a hyperscale data center.

 

It could be a scale-out for enterprise data center, for example, on VMware.

You can do this on any of our GPUs.

 

We have hundreds of millions of GPUs in the field and millions of GPUs in the cloud and just about every single cloud.

And it runs in a single GPU configuration as well as multi-GPU per compute or multi-node.

 

It also has multiple sessions or multiple computing instances per GPU.

So from multiple instances per GPU to multiple GPUs, multiple nodes to entire data center scale.

 

So this run time called NVIDIA AI enterprise has something like 4,500 software packages, software libraries and has something like 10,000 dependencies among each other.

And that run time is, as I mentioned, continuously updated and optimized for our installed base for our stack.

 

And that's just one example of what it would take to get accelerated computing to work.

The number of code combinations and type of application combinations is really quite insane.

 

And it's taken us two decades to get here.

But what I would characterize as probably our -- the elements of our company, if you will, are several.

 

I would say number 1 is architecture.

The flexibility, the versatility and the performance of our architecture makes it possible for us to do all the things that I just said, from data processing to training to inference, for preprocessing of the data before you do the inference to the post processing of the data, tokenizing of languages so that you could then train with it.

 

The amount of -- the workflow is much more intense than just training or inference.

But anyways, that's where we'll focus and it's fine.

 

But when people actually use these computing systems, it's quite -- requires a lot of applications.

And so the combination of our architecture makes it possible for us to deliver the lowest cost ownership.

 

And the reason for that is because we accelerate so many different things.

The second characteristic of our company is the installed base.

 

You have to ask yourself, why is it that all the software developers come to our platform?

And the reason for that is because software developers seek a large installed base so that they can reach the largest number of end users, so that they could build a business or get a return on the investments that they make.

 

And then the third characteristic is reach.

We're in the cloud today, both for public cloud, public-facing cloud because we have so many customers that use -- so many developers and customers that use our platform.

 

CSPs are delighted to put it up in the cloud.

They use it for internal consumption to develop and train and to operate recommender systems or search or data processing engines and whatnot all the way to training and inference.

 

And so we're in the cloud, we're in enterprise.

Yesterday, we had a very big announcement.

 

It's really worthwhile to take a look at that.

VMware is the operating system of the world's enterprise.

 

And we've been working together for several years now, and we're going to bring together -- together, we're going to bring generative AI to the world's enterprises all the way out to the edge.

And so reach is another reason.

 

And because of reach, all of the world's system makers are anxious to put NVIDIA's platform in their systems.

And so we have a very broad distribution from all of the world's OEMs and ODMs and so on and so forth because of our reach.

 

And then lastly, because of our scale and velocity, we were able to sustain this really complex stack of software and hardware, networking and compute and across all of these different usage models and different computing environments.

And we're able to do all this while accelerating the velocity of our engineering.

 

It seems like we're introducing a new architecture every two years.

Now we're introducing a new architecture, a new product just about every six months.

 

And so these properties make it possible for the ecosystem to build their company and their business on top of us.

And so those in combination makes us special.

 
Operator

Next, we'll go to Atif Malik with Citi.

 

Your line is open.



Atif Malik

Hi.

 

Thank you for taking my question.

Great job on results and outlook.

 

Colette, I have a question on the core L40S that you guys talked about.

Any idea how much of the supply tightness can L40S help with?

 

And if you can talk about the incremental profitability or gross margin contribution from this product?

Thank you.

 



Jensen Huang

Yeah, Atif.

 

Let me take that for you.

The L40S is really designed for a different type of application.

 

H100 is designed for large-scale language models and processing just very large models and a great deal of data.

And so that's not L40S' focus.

 

L40S' focus is to be able to fine-tune models, fine-tune pretrained models, and it'll do that incredibly well.

It has a transform engine.

 

It's got a lot of performance.

You can get multiple GPUs in a server.

 

It's designed for hyperscale scale-out, meaning it's easy to install L40S servers into the world's hyperscale data centers.

It comes in a standard rack, standard server, and everything about it is standard and so it's easy to install.

 

L40S also is with the software stack around it and along with BlueField-3 and all the work that we did with VMware and the work that we did with Snowflakes and ServiceNow and so many other enterprise partners.

L40S is designed for the world's enterprise IT systems.

 

And that's the reason why HPE, Dell, and Lenovo and some 20 other system makers building about 100 different configurations of enterprise servers are going to work with us to take generative AI to the world's enterprise.

And so L40S is really designed for a different type of scale-out, if you will.

 

It's, of course, large language models.

It's, of course, generative AI, but it's a different use case.

 

And so the L40S is going to -- is off to a great start and the world's enterprise and hyperscalers are really clamoring to get L40S deployed.
Operator

Next, we'll go to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

 

Your line is open.



Joseph Moore

Great.

 

Thank you.

I guess the thing about these numbers that's so remarkable to me is the amount of demand that remains unfulfilled, talking to some of your customers.

 

As good as these numbers are, you sort of more than tripled your revenue in a couple of quarters.

There's a demand, in some cases, for multiples of what people are getting.

 

So can you talk about that?

How much unfulfilled demand do you think there is?

 

And you talked about visibility extending into next year.

Do you have line of sight into when you get to see supply-demand equilibrium here?

 



Jensen Huang

Yeah.

 

We have excellent visibility through the year and into next year.

And we're already planning the next-generation infrastructure with the leading CSPs and data center builders.

 

The demand – easiest way to think about the demand, the world is transitioning from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing.

That's the easiest way to think about the demand.

 

The best way for companies to increase their throughput, improve their energy efficiency, improve their cost efficiency is to divert their capital budget to accelerated computing and generative AI.

Because by doing that, you're going to offload so much workload off of the CPUs, but the available CPUs is -- in your data center will get boosted.

 

And so what you're seeing companies do now is recognizing this -- the tipping point here, recognizing the beginning of this transition and diverting their capital investment to accelerated computing and generative AI.

And so that's probably the easiest way to think about the opportunity ahead of us.

 

This isn't a singular application that is driving the demand, but this is a new computing platform, if you will, a new computing transition that's happening.

And data centers all over the world are responding to this and shifting in a broad-based way.

 
Operator

Next, we go to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.

 

Your line is now open.



Toshiya Hari

Hi.

 

Thank you for taking the question.

I had one quick clarification question for Colette and then another one for Jensen.

 

Colette, I think last quarter, you had said CSPs were about 40% of your Data Center revenue, consumer Internet at 30%, enterprise 30%.

Based on your remarks, it sounded like CSPs and consumer Internet may have been a larger percentage of your business.

 

If you can kind of clarify that or confirm that, that would be super helpful.

And then Jensen, a question for you.

 

Given your position as the key enabler of AI, the breadth of engagements and the visibility you have into customer projects, I'm curious how confident you are that there will be enough applications or use cases for your customers to generate a reasonable return on their investments.

I guess I ask the question because there is a concern out there that there could be a bit of a pause in your demand profile in the out years.

 

Curious if there's enough breadth and depth there to support a sustained increase in your Data Center business going forward.

Thank you.

 



Colette Kress

Okay.

 

So thank you, Toshiya, on the question regarding our types of customers that we have in our Data Center business.

And we look at it in terms of combining our compute as well as our networking together.

 

Our CSPs, our large CSPs are contributing a little bit more than 50% of our revenue within Q2.

And the next largest category will be our consumer Internet companies.

 

And then the last piece of that will be our enterprise and high performance computing.



Jensen Huang

Toshi, I'm reluctant to guess about the future and so I'll answer the question from the first principle of computer science perspective.

 

It is recognized for some time now that general purpose computing is just not and brute forcing general purpose computing.

Using general purpose computing at scale is no longer the best way to go forward.

 

It's too energy costly, it's too expensive, and the performance of the applications are too slow.

And finally, the world has a new way of doing it.

 

It's called accelerated computing and what kicked it into turbocharge is generative AI.

But accelerated computing could be used for all kinds of different applications that's already in the data center.

 

And by using it, you offload the CPUs.

You save a ton of money in order of magnitude, in cost and order of magnitude and energy and the throughput is higher and that's what the industry is really responding to.

 

Going forward, the best way to invest in the data center is to divert the capital investment from general purpose computing and focus it on generative AI and accelerated computing.

Generative AI provides a new way of generating productivity, a new way of generating new services to offer to your customers, and accelerated computing helps you save money and save power.

 

And the number of applications is, well, tons.

Lots of developers, lots of applications, lots of libraries.

 

It's ready to be deployed.

And so I think the data centers around the world recognize this, that this is the best way to deploy resources, deploy capital going forward for data centers.

 

This is true for the world's clouds and you're seeing a whole crop of new GPU specialty -- GPU specialized cloud service providers.

One of the famous ones is CoreWeave and they're doing incredibly well.

 

But you're seeing the regional GPU specialist service providers all over the world now.

And it's because they all recognize the same thing, that the best way to invest their capital going forward is to put it into accelerated computing and generative AI.

 

We're also seeing that enterprises want to do that.

But in order for enterprises to do it, you have to support the management system, the operating system, the security and software-defined data center approach of enterprises, and that's all VMware.

 

And we've been working several years with VMware to make it possible for VMware to support not just the virtualization of CPUs but a virtualization of GPUs as well as the distributed computing capabilities of GPUs, supporting NVIDIA's BlueField for high-performance networking.

And all of the generative AI libraries that we've been working on is now going to be offered as a special SKU by VMware's sales force, which is, as we all know, quite large because they reach some several hundred thousand VMware customers around the world.

 

And this new SKU is going to be called VMware Private AI Foundation.

And this will be a new SKU that makes it possible for enterprises.

 

And in combination with HP, Dell, and Lenovo's new server offerings based on L40S, any enterprise could have a state-of-the-art AI data center and be able to engage generative AI.

And so I think the answer to that question is hard to predict exactly what's going to happen quarter-to-quarter.

 

But I think the trend is very, very clear now that we're seeing a platform shift.
Operator

Next, we'll go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

 

Your line is now open.



Timothy Arcuri

Thanks a lot.

 

Can you talk about the attach rate of your networking solutions to your -- to the compute that you're shipping?

In other words, is like half of your compute shipping with your networking solutions more than half, less than half?

 

And is this something that maybe you can use to prioritize allocation of the GPUs?

Thank you.

 



Jensen Huang

Well, working backwards, we don't use that to prioritize the allocation of our GPUs.

 

We let customers decide what networking they would like to use.

And for the customers that are building very large infrastructure, InfiniBand is, I hate to say it, kind of a no-brainer.

 

And the reason for that because the efficiency of InfiniBand is so significant, some 10%, 15%, 20% higher throughput for $1 billion infrastructure translates to enormous savings.

Basically, the networking is free.

 

And so, if you have a single application, if you will, infrastructure or it’s largely dedicated to large language models or large AI systems, InfiniBand is really a terrific choice.

However, if you’re hosting for a lot of different users and Ethernet is really core to the way you manage your data center, we have an excellent solution there that we had just recently announced and it’s called Spectrum-X.

 

Well, we’re going to bring the capabilities, if you will, not all of it, but some of it, of the capabilities of InfiniBand to Ethernet so that we can also, within the environment of Ethernet, allow you to – enable you to get excellent generative AI capabilities.

So Spectrum-X is just ramping now.

 

It requires BlueField-3 and it supports both our Spectrum-2 and Spectrum-3 Ethernet switches.

And the additional performance is really spectacular.

 

BlueField-3 makes it possible and a whole bunch of software that goes along with it.

BlueField, as all of you know, is a project really dear to my heart, and it’s off to just a tremendous start.

 

I think it’s a home run.

This is the concept of in-network computing and putting a lot of software in the computing fabric is being realized with BlueField-3, and it is going to be a home run.

Our final question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius.

 

Your line is now open.



Benjamin Reitzes

Hi.

 

Good afternoon.

Good evening.

 

Thank you for the question, putting me in here.

My question is with regard to DGX Cloud.

 

Can you talk about the reception that you're seeing and how the momentum is going?

And then Colette, can you also talk about your software business?

 

What is the run rate right now and the materiality of that business?

And it does seem like it's already helping margins a bit.

 

Thank you very much.



Jensen Huang

DGX Cloud's strategy, let me start there.

 

DGX Cloud's strategy is to achieve several things: number one, to enable a really close partnership between us and the world's CSPs.

We recognize that many of our -- we work with some 30,000 companies around the world.

 

15,000 of them are startups.

Thousands of them are generative AI companies and the fastest-growing segment, of course, is generative AI.

 

We're working with all of the world's AI start-ups.

And ultimately, they would like to be able to land in one of the world's leading clouds.

 

And so we built DGX Cloud as a footprint inside the world's leading clouds so that we could simultaneously work with all of our AI partners and help blend them easily in one of our cloud partners.

The second benefit is that it allows our CSPs and ourselves to work really closely together to improve the performance of hyperscale clouds, which is historically designed for multi-tenancy and not designed for high-performance distributed computing like generative AI.

 

And so to be able to work closely architecturally to have our engineers work hand in hand to improve the networking performance and the computing performance has been really powerful, really terrific.

And then thirdly, of course, NVIDIA uses very large infrastructures ourselves.

 

And our self-driving car team, our NVIDIA research team, our generative AI team, our language model team, the amount of infrastructure that we need is quite significant.

And none of our optimizing compilers are possible without our DGX systems.

 

Even compilers these days require AI, and optimizing software and infrastructure software requires AI to even develop.

It's been well publicized that our engineering uses AI to design our chips.

 

And so the internal -- our own consumption of AI, our robotics team, so on and so forth, Omniverse teams, so on and so forth, all needs AI.

And so our internal consumption is quite large as well, and we land that in DGX Cloud.

 

And so DGX Cloud has multiple use cases, multiple drivers, and it's been off to just an enormous success.

And our CSPs love it, the developers love it and our own internal engineers are clamoring to have more of it.

 

And it's a great way for us to engage and work closely with all of the AI ecosystem around the world.



Colette Kress

And let's see if I can answer your question regarding our software revenue.

 

In part of our opening remarks that we made as well, remember, software is a part of almost all of our products, whether they're our Data Center products, GPU systems or any of our products within gaming and our future automotive products.

You're correct, we're also selling it in a standalone business.

 

And that stand-alone software continues to grow where we are providing both the software services, upgrades across there as well.

Now we're seeing, at this point, probably hundreds of millions of dollars annually for our software business, and we are looking at NVIDIA AI enterprise to be included with many of the products that we're selling, such as our DGX, such as our PCIe versions of our H100.

 

And I think we're going to see more availability even with our CSP marketplaces.

So we're off to a great start, and I do believe we'll see this continue to grow going forward.

 
Operator

And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

 

I'll turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for any additional or closing remarks.



Jensen Huang

A new computing era has begun.

 

The industry is simultaneously going through 2 platform transitions, accelerated computing and generative AI.

Data centers are making a platform shift from general purpose to accelerated computing.

 

The $1 trillion of global data centers will transition to accelerated computing to achieve an order of magnitude better performance, energy efficiency and cost.

Accelerated computing enabled generative AI, which is now driving a platform shift in software and enabling new, never-before possible applications.

 

Together, accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a broad-based computer industry platform shift.

Our demand is tremendous.

 

We are significantly expanding our production capacity.

Supply will substantially increase for the rest of this year and next year.

 

NVIDIA has been preparing for this for over two decades and has created a new computing platform that the world’s industry -- world’s industries can build upon.

What makes NVIDIA special are: one, architecture.

 

NVIDIA accelerates everything from data processing, training, inference, every AI model, real-time speech to computer vision, and giant recommenders to vector databases.

The performance and versatility of our architecture translates to the lowest data center TCO and best energy efficiency.

 

Two, installed base.

NVIDIA has hundreds of millions of CUDA-compatible GPUs worldwide.

 

Developers need a large installed base to reach end users and grow their business.

NVIDIA is the developer’s preferred platform.

 

More developers create more applications that make NVIDIA more valuable for customers.

Three, reach.

 

NVIDIA is in clouds, enterprise data centers, industrial edge, PCs, workstations, instruments and robotics.

Each has fundamentally unique computing models and ecosystems.

 

System suppliers like OEMs, computer OEMs can confidently invest in NVIDIA because we offer significant market demand and reach.

Scale and velocity.

 

NVIDIA has achieved significant scale and is 100% invested in accelerated computing and generative AI.

Our ecosystem partners can trust that we have the expertise, focus and scale to deliver a strong road map and reach to help them grow.

 

We are accelerating because of the additive results of these capabilities.

We’re upgrading and adding new products about every six months versus every two years to address the expanding universe of generative AI.

 

While we increased the output of H100 for training and inference of large language models, we’re ramping up our new L40S universal GPU for scale, for cloud scale-out and enterprise servers.

Spectrum-X, which consists of our Ethernet switch, BlueField-3 Super NIC and software helps customers who want the best possible AI performance on Ethernet infrastructures.

 

Customers are already working on next-generation accelerated computing and generative AI with our Grace Hopper.

We’re extending NVIDIA AI to the world’s enterprises that demand generative AI but with the model privacy, security and sovereignty.

 

Together with the world’s leading enterprise IT companies, Accenture, Adobe, Getty, Hugging Face, Snowflake, ServiceNow, VMware and WPP and our enterprise system partners, Dell, HPE, and Lenovo, we are bringing generative AI to the world’s enterprise.

We’re building NVIDIA Omniverse to digitalize and enable the world’s multi-trillion dollar heavy industries to use generative AI to automate how they build and operate physical assets and achieve greater productivity.

 

Generative AI starts in the cloud, but the most significant opportunities are in the world’s largest industries, where companies can realize trillions of dollars of productivity gains.

It is an exciting time for NVIDIA, our customers, partners and the entire ecosystem to drive this generational shift in computing.

 

We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.

Satya Nadella

Thank you, Brett.

 

It was a record quarter driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%.

We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale by infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains.

 

Now I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress starting with Azure.

Azure again took share this quarter with our AI advantage.

 

Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference in the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon Azure Maia.

And with Azure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open-source models, including both LLM and SLMs, all integrated deeply with infrastructure, data, and tools on Azure.

 

We now have 53,000 Azure AI customers, over one-third are new to Azure over the past 12 months.

Our new models of service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLM's from our partners like Cohere, Meta, and Mistral on Azure, without having to manage underlying infrastructure.

 

We have also built the world's most popular SLMs, which offer performance comparable to larger models, but are small enough to run on a laptop or mobile device.

Anker, Ashley, AT&T, EY, and Thomson Reuters, for example, are all already exploring how to use our SLM-5 for their applications.

 

And we have great momentum with Azure OpenAI Service.

This quarter we added support for OpenAI's latest models including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 with Vision, DALL-E 3 as well as fine-tuning.

 

We are seeing increased usage from AI-first start-ups like Moveworks, Perplexity, SymphonyAI, as well as some of the world's largest companies.

Over half of the Fortune 500 use Azure OpenAI today including Ally Financial, Coca-Cola, and Rockwell Automation.

 

For example, at CES this month, Walmart shared how it's using Azure OpenAI Service along with its own proprietary data and models to streamline how more than 50,000 associates work and transform how it's millions of customers’ shop.

More broadly, customers continue to choose Azure to simplify and accelerate their cloud migrations.

 

Overall, we are seeing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of $1 billion-plus Azure commitments.

Vodafone, for example, will invest $1.5 billion in Cloud and AI services over the next 10 years as it works to transform the digital experience of more than 300 million customers worldwide.

 

Now on to data.

We are integrating the power of AI across the entire data stack.

 

Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, governance, and AI to help organizations simplify and consolidate their data estates.

Cosmos DB is the go-to database to build AI-powered apps at any scale powering workloads for companies in every industry from AXA and Kohl's to Mitsubishi and TomTom.

 

KPMG, for example, has used Cosmos DB including its built-in native vector search capabilities along with Azure OpenAI service to power an AI assistant, which it credits with driving an up to 50% increase in productivity for its consultants.

All-up, Cosmos DB data transactions increased 42% year-over-year and for those organizations who want to go beyond in-database vector search, Azure AI search offers the best hybrid search solution.

 

OpenAI is using it for retrieval augmented generation as part of ChatGPT.

And this quarter, we made Microsoft Fabric generally available, helping customers like Milliman and PwC go from data to insights to action, all within the same unified SaaS solution.

 

Data stored in Fabric's multi-cloud data lake, OneLake increased 46% quarter-over-quarter.

Now on to developers.

 

From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer tools for the era of AI.

GitHub revenue accelerated to over 40% year-over-year, driven by all-up platform growth and adoption of GitHub Copilot, the world's most widely deployed AI developer tool.

 

We now have over 1.3 million paid GitHub copilot subscribers, up 30% quarter-over-quarter, and more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot business to supercharge the productivity of their developers from digital natives like Etsy and HelloFresh to leading enterprises like Autodesk, Dell Technologies, and Goldman Sachs.

Accenture alone will rollout GitHub Copilot to 50,000 of its developers this year and we're going further making copilot ubiquitous across the entire GitHub platform and new AI-powered security features, as well as Copilot enterprise, which tailors Copilot to organization's code bases and allows developers to converse with it in natural language.

 

We're also the leader in low-code no-code development helping everyone create apps, automate workflows, analyze data, and now build custom copilots.

More than 230,000 organizations have already used AI capabilities in Power Platform, up over 80% quarter-over-quarter, and with Copilot Studio, organizations can tailor Copilot for Microsoft 365 or create their own custom copilots.

 

It is already being used by over 10,000 organizations including An Post, Holland America, PG&E.

In just weeks, for example, both PayPal and Tata Digital built copilots to answer common employee queries, increasing productivity and reducing support costs.

 

We're also using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications.

Dynamics 365 once again took share as organizations use our AI-powered apps to transform their marketing, sales, service, finance, and supply-chain functions.

 

And we are expanding our TAM by integrating Copilot into third-party systems too.

In sales out Copilot has helped sellers at more than 30,000 organizations including Lumen Technologies and Schneider Electric to enrich their customer interactions using data from Dynamics 365 or Salesforce.

 

And with our new Copilot for service employees at companies like Northern Trust can resolve client queries faster.

It includes out-of-the-box integrations to apps like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk.

 

With our industry and cross-industry clouds, we're tailoring our solutions to meet the needs of specific industries.

In healthcare, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 100 healthcare systems including Lifespan, UNC Health and UPMC to increase physician productivity and reduce burnout.

 

And our Cloud for Retail was front and center at NRF with retailers from Canadian Tire Corporation, to Leatherman and Ralph Lauren sharing how they will use our solutions across the shopper journey to accelerate time to value.

Now on to future of work.

 

A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work.

Our own research as well as external studies show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks.

 

And overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in a series of tasks like searching, writing, and summarizing.

Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees.

 

And we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes.

We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge.

 

ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities.

When it comes to Teams, we again saw record usage as organizations brought together collaboration chat, meetings, and calling on one platform and Teams has also become a new entry point for us.

 

More than two-thirds of our enterprise Teams customers buy Phone, Rooms or Premium.

All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365.

 

We now have more than 400 million paid Office 365 seats and organizations like BP, Elanco, ING Bank, Mediaset, WTW, all chose E5 this quarter to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps along with advanced security compliance, voice, and analytics.

Now on to Windows.

 

In 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC.

Windows PCs with built-in neural processing units were front and center at CES, unlocking new AI experiences to make what you do on your PC easier and faster from searching for answers and summarizing emails to optimizing performance and battery efficiency.

 

Copilot in Windows is already available on more than 75 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs and with our new Copilot key, the first significant change to the Windows keyboard in 30 years, we're providing one-click access.

We also continue to transform how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, introducing new features that make it simpler for employees to access and IT teams to secure their cloud PCs.

 

Usage of cloud-delivered Windows increased over 50% year-over-year.

And all-up, Windows 11 commercial deployments increased 2 times year-over-year as companies like HPE and Petrobras rolled out operating systems to employees.

 

Now onto security.

The recent security attacks, including the nation-state attack on our corporate systems, we reported a week and a half ago have highlighted the urgent need for organizations to move even faster to protect themselves from cyber threats.

 

It's why last fall we announced a set of engineering priorities under our secure future initiative, bringing together every part of the company to advance cyber security protection across both new products and legacy infrastructure.

And it's why we continue to innovate across our security portfolio as well as our operational security posture to help customers adopt a Zero Trust security architecture.

 

Our industry-first unified security operations platform brings together our SIM Microsoft Sentinel, our XDR Microsoft Defender, and Copilot for security to help teams manage an increasingly complex security landscape.

And with Copilot for security, we're now helping hundreds of early access customers including Cmax, Dow, LTI Mindtree, McAfee, Nucor Steel, significantly increase their SecOps team's productivity.

 

This quarter, we extended copilot to Entra, Intune, and Purview.

All-up, we have over 1 million customers, including more than 700,000 who use four or more of our security products like Arrow Electronics, DXC Technology, Freeport-McMoRan, Insight Enterprises, JB Hunt, and the Mosaic Company.

 

Now on to LinkedIn.

LinkedIn is now helping over 1 billion members learn, sell, and get hired.

 

We continue to see strong global membership growth driven by member sign-ups in key markets like Germany and India.

In an ever-changing job market, members are staying competitive through skill-building and knowledge-sharing.

 

Over the last 12 months, members have added 680 million skills to their profiles, up 80% year-over-year.

Our new AI-powered features are transforming the LinkedIn member experience, everything from how people learn new skills to how they search for jobs and engage with [indiscernible].

 

New AI features, including more personalized emails also continue to increase business ROI on the platform and our hiring business took share for the sixth consecutive quarter.

And more broadly, AI is transforming our search and browser experience.

 

We are encouraged by the momentum, earlier this month, we achieved a new milestone with 5 billion images created and 5 billion chats conducted to-date, both doubling quarter-over-quarter and both being an edge took share this quarter.

We also introduced Copilot as a standalone destination across all browsers and devices, as well as a Copilot app on iOS and Android.

 

And just two weeks ago, we introduced Copilot Pro providing access to the latest models for quick answers and high-quality image creation and access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 personal and family subscribers.

Now on to gaming.

 

This quarter we set all-time records for monthly active users in Xbox PC, as well as mobile, where we now have over 200 million monthly active users alone, inclusive of Activision Blizzard King.

With our acquisition, we have added hundreds of millions of gamers to our ecosystem, as we execute on our ambition to reach more gamers on more platforms.

 

With cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love where and when and how they want, hours streamed increased 44% year-over-year.

Great content is key to our growth and across our portfolio, I've never been more excited about our line-up of upcoming games.

 

Earlier this month, we shared exciting new first-party titles coming this year to Xbox PC and Game Pass including Indiana Jones.

And we've also announced launching significant updates this calendar year to many of our most durable franchises, which brings in millions of players each month, including Call of Duty, Elder Scrolls Online, and Starfield.

 

In closing, we are looking forward to how AI-driven transformation will benefit people and organizations in 2024.

With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.

 



Amy Hood

Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone.

 

This quarter, revenue was $62 billion, up 18% and 16% in constant currency.

When adjusted for the prior year's Q2 charge, operating income increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $2.93, which increased 26% and 23% in constant currency.

 

Results exceeded expectations and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth.

Strong execution by our sales teams and partners drove share gains again this quarter across many of our businesses, as Satya referenced.

 

In our commercial business, strong demand for our Microsoft cloud offerings, including AI services drove better-than-expected growth and large long-term Azure contracts.

Microsoft 365 suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our office commercial business, while new business growth continued to be moderated for standalone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite.

 

Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 9% in constant currency on a low expiry base.

The strength in long-term Azure contracts mentioned earlier, along with strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals drove our results.

 

Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 17% and 16% in constant currency to $222 billion, roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year-over-year.

The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 19%.

 

And this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%.

In our consumer business, the PC and advertising markets were generally in line with our expectations.

 

PC market volumes continued to stabilize at pre-pandemic levels [Technical Difficulty] Gaming console market was a bit smaller.

As a reminder, my Q2 commentary includes the net impact of Activision from the date of acquisition, inclusive of purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related expenses.

 

The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party.

At a company level, Activision contributed approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2 point drag on adjusted operating income growth, and a negative $0.5 impact to earnings per share.

 

This impact includes $1.1 billion from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs, such as severance-related charges related to last week's announcement.

FX was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth.

 

Microsoft Cloud revenue was $33.7 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 24% and 22% in constant currency.

Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 72%, relatively unchanged year-over-year.

 

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand.

Company gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant-currency and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 68%.

 

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, even with the impact of $581 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.

Growth was driven by improvement in devices, as well as the improvement in Azure and Office 365 as just mentioned.

 

Operating expenses increased 3% with 11 points from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 7 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge.

The Activision impact includes $550 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related cost.

 

At a company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% lower than a year ago.

Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year-over-year to 44%.

 

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 points driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier, the favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge, and improved operating leverage through disciplined cost control.

Now, to our segment results.

 

Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.2 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected results in LinkedIn.

Office commercial revenue grew 15% and 13% in constant currency.

 

Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 16% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum.

Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 9% year-over-year to over $400 million with installed base expansion across all customer segments.

 

Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, offset by the continued growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier.

Office commercial licensing declined 17% and 18% in constant currency with continued customer shift to cloud offerings.

 

Office Consumer revenue increased 5% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 355 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 78.4 million.

In our Talent Solutions business bookings growth was again impacted by weaker hiring environment in key verticals.

Dynamics revenue grew 21% and 19% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 27% and 24% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads.

 

Bookings growth was impacted by weaker new business, primarily in Dynamics 365 ERP and CRM workloads.

Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 12% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year.

 

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Office 365.

Operating expenses decreased 5% and 6% in constant currency, with 5 points of favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge.

 

Operating income increased 26% and 24% in constant currency.

Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment, revenue was $25.9 billion, increasing 20% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses.

 

Overall server products and cloud services revenue grew 22% and 20% in constant currency.

Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 30% and 28% in constant-currency, including 6 points of growth from AI services.

 

Both AI and non-AI Azure services drove our outperformance.

In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 11% to over 268 million seats with continued impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier.

 

In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 3% and 2% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven primarily by the better-than-expected demand related to Windows Server 2012 end of support.

Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions.

 

Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged.

Growth includes 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.

 

Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better performance and higher monetizing consumer markets.

Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant-currency, below expectations primarily [Technical Difficulty] period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts.

 

Annuity billings growth remains healthy.

Devices revenue decreased 9% and 10% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment.

 

Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 8% and 7% in constant currency, relatively in line with expectations, driven by higher search volume, offset by negative impact from a third-party partnership.

And in gaming, revenue increased 49% and 48% in constant currency, with 44 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.

 

Total gaming revenue was in line with expectations of stronger-than-expected performance from Activision was offset by the weaker-than-expected console market noted earlier.

Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% and 60% in constant currency, driven by 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.

 

Xbox hardware revenue grew 3% and 1% in constant currency.

Segment gross margin dollars increased 34% and 32% in constant currency with 17 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.

Operating expenses increased 38% with 48 points of impact from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 6 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge.

 

Operating income increased 29% and 26% in constant currency.

Now back to total company results.

 

Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $11.5 billion, lower-than-expected due to delivery for a third-party capacity contract shifting from Q2 to Q3.

Cash paid-for PP&E was $9.7 billion.

 

These data center investments support our cloud demand, inclusive of needs to scale our AI infrastructure.

Cash flow from operations was $18.9 billion, up 69% driven by strong cloud billings and collections on a prior year comparable that was impacted by lower operating income.

 

Free cash flow was $9.1 billion, up 86% year-over-year, reflecting the timing of cash paid-for property and equipment.

This quarter, other income and expense was in line with expectations, negative $506 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on investments, partially offset by interest income.

 

Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%.

And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

 

Now moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise is on a US dollar basis.

First FX, based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by less than 1 point.

 

And we expect no impact to COGS and operating expense growth.

In commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals along with long-term Azure commitments should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base.

 

Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year, excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvement in Office 365 and Azure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure, as well as the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand.

We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure and the flip of a delivery date from Q2 to Q3 from a third-party provider noted earlier.

 

As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out.

Next to segment guidance.

 

In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $19.3 billion to $19.6 billion or growth between 10% and 12%.

In Office Commercial revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5.

 

We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 15% in constant currency.

While it's early days for Microsoft 365 Copilot, we're excited by the adoption we've seen to date and continue to expect revenue to grow over time.

 

In our on-premise business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20s.

In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single-digits, driven by Microsoft's 365 subscriptions.

 

For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits, driven by continued growth across all businesses.

And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365.

 

For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $26 billion to $26.3 billion or growth between 18% and 19%.

Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts.

 

In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth in constant currency to remain stable to our stronger-than-expected Q2 results.

Growth will be driven by our Azure consumption business with continued strong contribution from AI.

 

Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 Suite momentum though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base.

In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid single-digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments.

 

And in the enterprise and partner services revenue should decline approximately 10% on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services and more Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $14.7 billion, $15.1 billion or growth between 11% and 14%.

Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels.

 

In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our Advanced Security Solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-teens.

As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability, primarily from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts.

 

In Devices, revenue should decline in the low-double-digits as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products.

Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid-to-high single-digits, about 8 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength.

 

And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low 40s, including approximately 45 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.

We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low-to-mid 50s, driven by approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.

 

Hardware revenue will decline year-over-year.

Now back to company guidance.

 

We expect COGS between $18.6 billion to $18.8 billion, including approximately $700 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition.

We expect operating expenses of $15.8 billion to $15.9 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.

 

Other income and expenses should be roughly negative $600 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and other losses.

As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility.

 

We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be in line with our full-year rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%.

Now, some additional thoughts on the full-fiscal year.

 

First FX, assuming current rates remain stable, we now expect FX to increase Q4 and full-year revenue growth by less than 1 point.

We continue to expect no meaningful impact to full-year COGS or operating expense growth.

 

Second Activision.

For the full-year FY 2024, we expect Activision to be accretive to operating income, when excluding purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related cost.

 

At a total company level, we delivered strong results in H1 and demand for our Microsoft Cloud continues to drive the growth in our outlook for H2.

Our commitment to scaling our cloud and AI investment is guided by customer demand and a substantial market opportunity.

 

As we scale these investments, we remain focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team.

Therefore, we expect full-year operating margins to be up 1 to 2 points year-over-year, even as AI capital investments drive COGS growth.

 

This operating margin expansion excludes the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year.

In closing, we are focused on execution.

 

So our customers can realize the benefits of AI productivity gains as we invest to lead this AI platform wave.

With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.

 



Brett Iversen

Thanks Amy.

 

We'll now move over to Q&A.

Out of respect for others on the call, we request the participants please only ask one question.

 

Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?
Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.

 

Please proceed.



Mark Moerdler

Thank you very much.

 

Congratulations on the strong quarter and thanks for letting me ask the question.

Amy, you've discussed Azure being stable and you deliver Azure growth stability, but if we drill in one layer, we see Azure AI [aiming] (ph) to become a bigger portion of the revenue.

 

I understand that separating what is directly AI revenue versus other IaaS, PaaS revenue that are leveraging well driven by AI is difficult, can you help me with two related questions?

Optimization has been stabilizing and at some point, it should be part of the revenue flow.

 

How should we think about what happens then, do we see non-directly AI consumption being flattish or do we see a rebound as the cloud shift continues and the need for data of inferencing grows?

Second point.

 

On AI, where are we in the journey from training driving most of Azure AI usage to inferencing?

When do you think we start to see pick-up in non-Microsoft inferencing kick in, when do you think we could hit the point where inferencing is the bigger part of the driver?

 

Thank you.



Satya Nadella

You want me to go first and...

 



Amy Hood

You go first and I'll take the technical.

 



Satya Nadella

Yes, let me -- just on the inferencing and training, most of what you've seen for the most part is all inferencing.

 

So, none of the large model training stuff is in any of our higher numbers at all.

What small batch training, so somebody is doing fine-tuning or what have you, that will be there, but that's sort of a minor part.

 

So, most of what you see in the Azure number is broadly inferencing.

And Mark, I think it may be helpful to sort of think about, like what is the new workload in AI?

 

The new workload in AI, obviously, in our case starts with one of the frontier -- I mean, starts with the Frontier model Azure OpenAI.

But it's not just about just one model, right.

 

So, you first -- you take that model, you do RLHF, you may do some fine-tuning, you do retrieval, which means you are sort of either heating some storage meter or you're heating some compute meters.

And so to -- and by the way, you will also distil a large model to a small model and that would be a training perhaps.

 

But that's a small batch training that uses essentially inference infrastructure.

So, I think that's what's happening.

 

So you could even say these AI workloads themselves will have a lifecycle which is they'll get rebuilt, then there'll be continuously optimized over time.

So, that's sort of one-side.

 

And I think if I understand your question, what's happening with the traditional optimization, and I think last quarter we said.

One, we're going to continue to have these cycles where people will build new workloads, they will optimize the workloads and then they'll start new workloads.

 

So I think that that's what we continue to see.

But that period of massive, I'll call it, optimization only and no new workloads start, that I think has ended at this point.

 

So what you're seeing is much more of that continuous cycles by customers, both whether it comes to AI or whether it comes to the traditional workloads.



Amy Hood

No, maybe I'll just add just a few things to that.

 

I think whether you use the word lapping, these optimization comparables or the comparables easing, is all sort of the same thing, that we're getting to that point, in H2 that's absolutely true.

We'd like to talk about the contribution of AI specifically for the reason Satya talked about, these are -- this is starting to see the application of AI at scale.

 

And we want to be able to show people, this is how that point will work, it's inferencing workloads where people are expecting productivity gains, other benefits that grow revenue and so, I do think about those as both related.

And ultimately the TAM that we go after is best sort of across both of those, both AI workload and I guess, “non-AI workload” although to Satya's point, you need all of it.

 



Mark Moerdler

Perfect.

 

Thank you very much for the deep answer.



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Mark.

 

Joe, next question, please.
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.

 

Please proceed.



Brent Thill

Good afternoon.

 

Amy, the margin improvement is pretty shocking to most considering the investments that you and Satya are putting into AI.

I'm curious if you could just walk through, how this is possible and what you're seeing so far in some of the costs that you're trying to manage as you scale up AI?

 



Amy Hood

Thanks, Brent.

 

First of all, thanks for the question.

The teams are obviously been hard at work on this topic.

 

We do point out that, Q2 because of the impact of the charge a year ago, you're seeing larger margin improvement than I would say, sort of a run-rate margin improvement.

So, let me first say that.

 

Secondly, the absolute margin improvement has also been very good and it speaks to, I think one of the things Satya talked about and I reiterated a bit, which is that, we want really to make sure we're making investments, we're making them in consistency across the tech stack.

The tech stack we're building, no matter what team is on, is inclusive of AI enablement.

 

And so think about as building that consistency without needing to add a lot of resources to do that.

It's been a real pivot of our entire investment infrastructure to be working on this work.

 

And I think that's important, because it means you're shifting to an AI-first position, not just in the language we use, but in what people are working on day-to-day.

That does obviously create a leverage opportunity.

 

There has also been really good work put in by many teams on improving the gross margin of the products; we talked about it with Office 365, we talked about in Azure core.

We even talked about it across our devices portfolio, where we've seen material improvements over the course of the year.

 

And so, when you kind of take improvements at the gross margin level, plus this consistency of re-pivoting our workforce toward the AI-first work we're doing, without adding material number of people to the workforce, you end up with that type of leverage.

And we still need to be investing.

 

And so, the important part, invest towards the thing that's going to shape the next decade and continue to stay focused on being able to deliver your day-to-day commitments.

And so it's a great question.

 

And hopefully, that helps piece apart a few of the components.



Brent Thill

Thanks, Amy.

 



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Brent.

 

Joe next question, please.
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.

 

Please proceed.



Kash Rangan

Hi, thank you very much.

 

A superb quarter of great improvements.

Just one question for you Satya.

 

Cloud computing changed the tech stack in ways that we could not imagine 10 years back, the nature of the database layer, the operating system layer, every layer just changed dramatically.

How do you foresee generative AI changing the tech stack as we know it?

 

Thank you so much.



Satya Nadella

Yes, I think it's going to have a very foundational impact.

 

In fact, you could say the core compute architecture itself changes, everything from power, power density to the data center design, to what used to be the accelerator, now is the sort of the main CPU, so to speak, or the main compute unit.

And so, I think in the network, the memory architecture, all of it.

 

So as the core computer architecture changes, I think every workload changes.

And so yes, so there is a full, like, take our data layer, the most exciting thing for me in the last year has been to see how our data layer has evolved to be built for AI, right?

 

If you think about Fabric, one of the genius of Fabric is to be able to say, let's separate out storage from the compute layer.

In compute we'll have traditional SQL, we’ll have Spark.

 

And by the way, you can have an Azure AI job on top of the same data lake, so to speak, or the lakehouse pattern.

And then the business model you can combine all of those different compute.

 

So that's the type of compute architecture.

So it's sort of a -- so that's just one example.

 

The tool stuff is changing.

Office, I mean if you think about what -- if I look at Copilot; Copilots extensibility with GPT, Copilot apps to the Copilot stack, that's another sort of part of what's happening to the tech stack.

 

So yes, I mean, definitely builds.

I mean.

 

I do believe, being in the cloud has been very helpful to build AI.

But now, AI is just redefining what it means to have, what the cloud looks like, both at the infrastructure level and the app model.

 



Kash Rangan

Terrific.

 

Thank you so much.



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Kash.

 

Joe, our next question, please.
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.

 

Please proceed.



Karl Keirstead

Thank you.

 

I wanted to return to AI, the six point AI lift to Azure is just extraordinary.

But I wanted to ask you about your progress in standing up the infrastructure to meet that demand.

 

If you feel like Microsoft is supply GPU-constrained.

Is the success you've had maybe working through some of the scaling bottlenecks that some of the other cloud infrastructure providers have talked about, a little bit maybe on the infrastructure scaling front might be interesting.

 

Thank you.



Amy Hood

Thanks, Karl.

 

Maybe I'll start and Satya feel free to add on.

I think we feel really good about where we have been in terms of adding capacity.

 

You started to see the acceleration in our capital expense starting almost a year ago, and you've seen us scale through that process.

And that is going toward as we talked about Servers and also new data center footprints to be able to meet what we see as this demand and really changing demand as we look forward.

 

And so, I do feel like the team has done a very good job.

I feel like, primarily obviously, this is being built by us, but we've also used third-party capacity to help when we could have that help us in terms of meeting customer demand.

 

And I think looking forward, you'll tend to C&I guide toward it, accelerated capital expense to continue to be able to add capacity in the coming quarters, given what we see in terms of pipeline.



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Karl.

 

Joe, next question, please.
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.

 

Please proceed.



Brad Zelnick

Great, thank you so much for taking the question.

 

The early market feedback that we're all hearing on Microsoft 365 copilot is very powerful.

Can you provide more granularity on what you're seeing in terms of adoption trends versus perhaps other new product introductions in the past, what if anything is holding it back, and how much of a priority is it to get it in the hands of customers?

 

To what lengths might you go to incentivize just getting it out in the market?

Thank you.

 



Satya Nadella

No, thank you for the question, Brad.

 

So, a couple of things.

In my comments I said increase in relation to our previous suites like, let's say, E3 or E5.

 

Whatever two months in, it's definitely much faster than that.

And so, from that perspective.

 

It's exciting to see, I’d say, the demand signal, the deployment signal.

I was looking at by tenant, even usage, it's faster than anything else because it's easier, right.

 

I mean, it's sort of -- it shows up in your app, if you click on it, like any ribbon thing and it becomes a daily habit.

So it in fact, it reminds me a little bit of sort of the back-in-the day of PC adoption, right.

 

It's kind of -- I think it first starts off with few people having access.

There are many companies that are doing standard issue, right.

 

So just like PCs became standard issue at some point after PCs being adopted by early adopters.

I think that's the cycle that at least we expect.

 

In terms of what we're seeing, it's actually interesting, If you look at the data we have, summarization, that's what it's like number-one, like I'm doing summarization of Teams meetings inside of Teams, during the meeting, after the meeting, word documents summarization, I get something in email on summarizing.

So summarization has become a big deal.

 

Drafts, right, you're drafting emails, drafting documents.

So, anytime you want to start something, the blank page thing goes away and you start by prompting and drafting.

 

Chat, to me, the most powerful feature is now you have the most important database in your company, which happens to be the database of your documents and communications.

It is now queryable by natural language in a powerful way, right.

 

I can go and say, what are all the things Amy said, I should be watching out for next quarter and it will come out with great detail.

And so Chat, summarization, draft, also by the way, actions.

 

One of the most used thing is, here's the Word document, go complete, I mean, create a PowerPoint for me.

So, those are the stuff that is also beginning.

 

So, I feel like these all become -- but fundamentally, what happens is, if you remember the PC adoption cycle, what it did was work artifact and work flow changed, right.

You can imagine what forecasting was before excel and email and what it was after.

 

So similarly, you'll see work and workflow change as people summarize faster, draft regulatory submissions faster.

Chat to get knowledge from your business.

 

And so, those are the things that we are seeing as overall patterns.



Amy Hood

And maybe just to add two points.

 

One of the exciting things as I said for some companies, it's going to be standard issue like PC, for other companies, they may want to do a land with a smaller group, see the productivity gains and then expand.

And so being able to lift some of the seat requirements that we did earlier this month, it's really going to allow customers to be able to use that approach too.

 

And the other thing I would add, we always talk about in enterprise software, you sell software, then you wait and then it gets deployed, and then after deployment, you want to see usage.

And in particular, what we've seen and you would expect this, in some ways with Copilot even in the early stages, obviously, deployment happens very quickly.

 

But really what we're seeing is engagement grow.

As to Satya's point on how you learn and your behavior changes you see engagement grow with time.

 

And so I think those are just to put a pin in that, because it's an important dynamic when we think about the optimism you hear from us.



Brad Zelnick

Excellent, thank you so much.

 



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Brad.

 

Joe, next question, please.
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with J.P.

 

Morgan.

Please proceed.

 



Mark Murphy

Yeah.

 

Thank you very much.

Is it possible to unpack the 6 point AI services tailwind, it's just to help us understand which elements ramped up by the three incremental points.

 

For instance, is it more of the open AI inferencing, GitHub Copilot, other Copilots, the Azure OpenAI service, third party LLMs running on Azure.

I'm just wondering, where did you see the strongest step-up in that activity?

 



Amy Hood

Mark, without getting into tons of line items, it's more simple to think of it as really, it's people adopting it for inferencing at the API generally.

 

I mean that's the easiest way to think about it.

And we also saw growth in GitHub Copilot which you talked -- which Satya talked about and we saw a growing number of third parties using it in some small ways for training.

 

But this is primarily an inferencing workload right now in terms of what's driving that number.

We used to think of it that way.

 



Satya Nadella

Azure OpenAI and then OpenAIs on APIs on top of Azure would be the sort of the major drivers.

 

But there is a lot of the small batch training that goes on, whether it's let Jeff for fine-tuning.

And then lot of people who are you starting to use models as a service with all the other new models, but it's predominantly Azure open AI today.

 



Mark Murphy

Thank you.

 



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Mark.

 

Joe, next question, please.
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel.

 

Please proceed.



Brad Reback

Great, thanks very much.

 

Amy for many, many years in Commercial Office 365 seat growth has far outpaced ARPU and over the last couple of quarters, we're getting a convergence, obviously, as the seat count gets really large.

As we look-forward, should they run even for a period of time or should we expect ARPU to outpace seat growth here in the short term?

 

Thanks.



Amy Hood

That's a great question, Brad.

 

Let me split apart the components.

And then we can come back to whether they should equalize or just go on sort of a bit, actually believe it or not, somewhat independent trajectory and I will explain why I say that.

 

Your seat growth as we talk about is primarily from, at this point, small and medium-size businesses and really frontline workers scenarios.

And to your point on occasion, those are lower ARPU seats, but there are also -- there are new seats and so you see that in the seat count number.

 

And as we get through and we've seen that come down a little bit quarter-over-quarter and we've guided for that really to happen again next quarter, but a very separate thing is being able to add ARPU.

And traditionally, and again this quarter, right, that's come over-time from E3.

 

Then from E5.

And we're continuing to see very healthy seat momentum and you heard very good renewals.

 

So, all of that, right, completely independent in some way from seat growth.

Then the next thing, that actually we just talked about, maybe in Brad's question I'm trying to recall is that, you're going to see Copilot revenue will run there as ARPU, right.

 

That won't show a seat growth.

So you'll have E3, E5 transition, Copilot, all show-up in ARPU over time, and then you’ll have the seat growth be primarily still small business and frontline worker and maybe new industry scenarios.

 

So, I tend to not really, Brad, think about them as related lines, believe it or not.

I think about them as sort of unique Independent motions we run and there is still room for seat growth and obviously with the levers we've talked about, there's room for ARPU growth as well.

 



Brad Reback

That's great.

 

Thanks very much.



Brett Iversen

Thanks, Brad.

 

Joe we have time for one last question.
Operator

Our last question will come from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi.

 

Please proceed.



Tyler Radke

Thanks for taking my question.

 

Satya your enthusiasm about GitHub Copilot was noticeable on the conference call and at the AI Summit in New York last week.

I'm wondering how you're thinking about pricing, obviously, this is driving pretty incredible breakthroughs and productivity for developers.

 

But how do you think about your ability to drive ARPU on the GitHub Copilot over-time and just talk us through how you're thinking about the next phase of new releases there?



Satya Nadella

Yeah.

 

I mean -- it's -- I always go back to sort of my own conviction that this generation of AI is going to be different, started with the move from 2.5 to 3 of GPT.

And then it's use inside of developer scenario with GitHub copilot and so yes.

 

I think this is the place where it's most evolved.

In terms of its economic benefits or productivity benefits and you see it.

 

We see it inside of Microsoft, we see it in all of the key studies we put out of customers, everybody had talked to its pick-up, but it is the one place where it's becoming standard issue for any developer is like if you takeaways spell check from Word, I'll be unemployable.

And similarly, it will be like -- I think GitHub Copilot becomes core to anybody who is doing software development.

 

The thing that you brought up is a little bit of a continuation to how Amy talked about, right.

So you are going to start seeing people think of these tools as productivity enhancers, right.

 

I mean, if I look at it, our ARPUs have been great, but they're pretty low..

You know even though we've had a lot of success, it's not like we had a high-priced ARPU company.

 

I think what you're going to start finding is, whether it's sales copilot or service copilot or GitHub Copilot of security copilot.

They are going to fundamentally capture some of the value they drive in terms of the productivity of the OpEx, right.

 

So it's like 2 points, 3 points of OpEx leverage would be goal is on software spend.

I think that's a pretty straightforward value equation.

 

And so that's the first time, I mean this is not something we've been able to make the case for before whereas now I think we have that case.

Then even the horizontal copilot is what Amy was talking about, which is at the Office 365 or Microsoft 365 level, even there, you can make the same argument whatever ARPU we may even have with E5, now, you can see incrementally as a percentage of the OpEx, how much would you pay for a copilot to give you more time savings for example.

 

And so yes, I think all up, I do see this as a new vector for us in what I'll call the next phase of knowledge work and frontline work even in their productivity and how we participate.

And I think GitHub copilot, I never thought of the tools business as fundamentally participating in the operating expenses of a company's spend on, let's say, development activity and now you're seeing that transition, it is just not tools, it's about productivity of your dev team.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

 

Today's call is being recorded.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President.

 

Please go ahead, ma'am.



Francesca DeMartino

Good morning and welcome to Pfizer's earnings call.

 

I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer.

On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us.

 

This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com.

Earlier this morning, we released our results for the second quarter of 2024 via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com.

 

I'm joined today by Dr.

Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; and Dave Denton, our CFO.

 

Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks and we will then open the call for questions.

Joining for the Q&A session, we also have Dr.

 

Chris Boshoff, EVP and Chief Oncology Officer; Alexandre de Germay, EVP and Chief International Commercial Officer; Dr.

Mikael Dolsten, Chief Scientific Officer and President of R&D; Doug Lankler, EVP and General Counsel; and Aamir Malik, EVP and Chief U.S.

 

Commercial Officer.

Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.

 

I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning, and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are all available on the IR website on pfizer.com.

Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements.

 

With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Francesca.

 

Good morning everyone.

We are pleased to report that we’ve had a strong first half of the year and our business is performing well.

 

We drove progress in the second quarter with solid execution as we continue making a difference in the lives of patients around the world.

Through the first six months of 2024, we reached more than 192 million patients with our medicines and vaccines.

 

Today, I’ll provide updates about how we continued advancing our key strategic priorities in the second quarter.

I will also mention examples from just the past few weeks when we have achieved a series of regulatory approvals, pipeline advances and other positive developments that we expect to fuel our progress through the rest of the year.

 

We are pleased with the strong financial results coming from our disciplined execution.

In the second quarter, for example, we achieved year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2022 when our COVID revenues had reached peaked.

 

Dave will talk about this and additional aspects of our financial performance, as well of course our outlook.

And then, we will take questions.

 

Before we go further, I will touch on some recent announcements about our leadership team and Board of Directors.

I'll start with Mikael Dolsten’s coming departure.

 

It’s hard to find words that do justice to the substantial impact Mikael has had during his 15-year tenure at Pfizer.

Mikael transformed our R&D engine, ultimately delivering 35 approvals that have been meaningful for millions of patients globally.

 

I thank my colleague, and my friend, for these tremendous contributions to human health.

I look forward to working closely with him over the coming months as we search for his successor.

 

Until then, Mikael will continue to lead as our Chief Scientific Officer and President of Pfizer Research & Development.

I want to welcome Andrew Baum, our new Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer.

 

Andrew brings deep clinical, scientific and biopharmaceutical sector expertise, and we are fortunate to have him to help shape and guide our strategy.

While Andrew is not able to join us today because he is relocating with his family to the United States, he will be with us for future quarterly calls.

 

I also want to mention the recent addition of Cyrus Taraporevala to our Board.

We are committed to strong governance supported by directors with a breadth of unique experiences and skills, exactly like Cyrus.

 

Cyrus was President and CEO at State Street Global Advisors until he retired, two years ago, and he brings vast experience in investment management and financial markets.

We are thrilled to have him joining our board.

 

Now, l'll turn to our performance.

The five strategic priorities we shared at the beginning of the year remain unchanged.

 

With our focus on the most important opportunities for advancing and strengthening our company, we are confident we remain on track in 2024.

In the second quarter, our colleagues moved our business forward in each key strategic area.

 

As a reminder, they are: achieving world-class oncology leadership, delivering the next wave of pipeline innovation, maximizing performance of our new products, expanding margins by realigning our cost base, and allocating capital in ways that will enhance shareholder value.

We believe we are well positioned to continue creating value for our shareholders.

 

I want to reinforce our commitment to maintaining and growing our dividend over time.

And, as Dave will discuss in more detail, we are raising our full-year 2024 guidance ranges for revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share.

 

Now, I’ll turn to our progress towards achieving the first one world-class oncology leadership.

Last year, we acted on our bold vision of combining Seagen's transformative ADC medicines with Pfizer’s expertise, innovation and scale.

 

We believed we could help people with cancer live better and longer lives and capture a differentiated opportunity to drive long-term sustainable growth for our company.

At the halfway mark in 2024, we are on track to make this vision a reality and we are pleased with the continued success of our integration.

 

We've had high rates of colleague retention and acquired Seagen products are contributing meaningfully to our revenues.

In particular, Padcev is rapidly progressing toward becoming the standard of care for patients with frontline locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.

 

We are pleased with the strength of other key products across our oncology portfolio.

Xtandi, Lorbrena, Braftovi-Mektovi combination, for example, continued as significant growth drivers during this quarter.

 

Our robust oncology commercial performance in the first half of 2024 included full FDA approval for Tivdak and European Medicines Agency approval for the Talzenna plus Xtandi combination.

We also received positive CHMP opinions for the Braftovi-Mektovi combination and for Padcev.

 

The last one is a notable development because Pfizer receives royalty revenues for these products marketed in Europe by our partners.

These highlights illustrate how we are already delivering breakthroughs that dramatically improve the lives of people with cancer.

 

Of course, we are also working to develop future breakthroughs where we have opportunities to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need.

I will review several recent pipeline highlights, starting with obesity.

 

Earlier this month, we announced our plans to move forward with development of danuglipron, our oral GLP-1 receptor agonist that is the most advanced candidate in our robust clinical and preclinical obesity pipeline.

In previously reported results from the Phase 2b study in obesity, danuglipron demonstrated what we believe is good efficacy in its twice-daily formulation.

 

For tolerability, we previously reported the maximum rate of GI adverse events across all doses investigated.

Looking at individual dose levels in our Phase 2b study, however, we observed tolerability profiles that are competitive for the class.

 

Our efforts are now focused on developing the once-daily formulation essential to delivering a competitive oral product.

We were encouraged by a pharmacokinetic study evaluating multiple modified release technologies and formulations.

 

This strengthened our confidence in potentially delivering a competitive once-daily pill at dose levels expected to be efficacious.

We plan to conduct dose optimization studies in the second half of the year that are intended to inform our registration enabling studies.

 

Obesity represents a growing area of patient need and it’s a key area of focus for Pfizer's R&D programs.

We believe these study results, along with learnings from our previous Phase 2 studies and data that we have accumulated from 1,400 participating patients, leave us well positioned to execute on a registration-enabling study as we work to deliver a competitive product in a rapidly growing market.

 

When we hosted our Oncology Innovation Day in February, we shared the pipeline milestones that would mark our success over the next year and we are already demonstrating progress.

A highlight was our strong presence at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting last month, which was anchored by three positive Phase 3 readouts.

 

Follow-up data from the Phase 3 CROWN study of Lorbrena in patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer showed 60% of patients on Lorbrena who are living beyond five years without disease progression.

This strengthens Lorbrena’s position as an emerging standard of care in the frontline setting.

 

Data from the Phase 3 ECHELON-3 study of Adcetris in combination with lenalidomide and rituximab demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

And, data from Phase 3 study evaluating an additional Adcetris combination regimen showed progression-free data in patients with newly diagnosed classical Hodgkin lymphoma, while significantly reducing side effects compared to a standard of care regimen used in Europe in this setting.

 

We have advanced our oncology clinical pipeline in 2024 with Phase 3 studies for sigvotatug vedotin, our integrin beta 6-directed ADC; atirmociclib, our selective CDK4 inhibitor; Elrexfio in the second-line setting in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; and mevrometostat, our EZH2 inhibitor, which we are now moving to Phase 3 and anticipate enrollment beginning in August.

We will continue working toward our 2030 oncology strategy goals of delivering eight or more blockbuster medicines and doubling the number of patients treated with our innovative cancer medicines.

 

We also have momentum with our vaccine programs.

In our next-gen PCV candidate, for example, we have advanced to a Phase 2 program in both adults and pediatrics, based on encouraging clinical data that we received that highlight our industry-leading capabilities in expanding valency beyond 20 serotypes.

 

We expect to be highly competitive by offering the largest serotype coverage in a single vaccine while strategically addressing the persistent medical need across invasive disease, antibiotic resistance and challenging serotypes.

In RSV with Abrysvo, I am pleased to report that yesterday we received an approval for Abrysvo's Act-O-Vial presentation in the United States, a presentation which offers advantages such as a never-frozen, unique system enabling one-step reconstitution highly valued by pharmacists.

 

Additionally, we have submitted for label expansion in both the United States and Europe for adults 18 to 59.

In our malignant hematology programs, we are also driving progress.

 

Last week, we reported positive results from a Phase 3 study demonstrating the safety and efficacy of our one-time gene therapy candidate for people with hemophilia A.

As we continue to advance our pipeline, additional milestones include expected updates later this year about our COVID/flu combination vaccine, marstacimab, for hemophilia A and B, and ponsegromab, for Cachexia, a wasting disorder associated with chronic disease.

 

Now I’ll turn to our strength with commercial execution of our business.

Another strategic area of focus is protecting and growing our core product portfolios while we also maximize the performance of our new products.

 

We continue to see encouraging progress with our team's execution.

Nurtec is an example where we are rising to meet substantial demand.

 

This product delivered strong results in the quarter with 44% year-over-year global operational revenue growth.

We see additional opportunities for expanding share in both acute and prevention usage, as well as growth opportunities in international markets where we are making progress with our launches.

 

I hope Alexandre will be able to touch based on this during the Q&A Session.

Now, I will touch on a few additional product portfolio highlights.

 

In the pediatric segment, Prevnar 20 continues to demonstrate strong performance that reinforces a leadership position among pneumococcal vaccines in the United States where market share grew to greater than 80%.

During the quarter, the performance of Abrysvo was in line with seasonal vaccine trends.

 

We remain confident in our full-year performance as we believe we are well positioned to help address the expected rising need later in the year among older adults at increased risk for RSV.

Litfulo is a product we launched last year and we're encouraged by strong demand.

 

Approximately one out of every two new patients on advanced systemic therapies is receiving a Litfulo prescription, a position we expect to grow as we continue focusing on execution.

We view Velsipity as a promising and much-needed option for adults with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis.

 

We're encouraged by recently securing preferred coverage for Velsipity at our first large national payer.

We expect to see the impact of this in 2025 and now we're working to build on this with additional payers.

 

When we consider core products in our portfolio, we are also seeing positive impact from strong execution.

The Vyndaqel family of products offers a good example of how we are making a difference for patients and our business.

 

We are accelerating growth by working with physicians to drive improvement in identifying appropriate patients with ATTR-cardiomyopathy and helping patients to access and stay on the therapy once it is prescribed.

With strong growth through the second quarter, we believe there is additional opportunity to identify more patients who could benefit from our Vyndaqel products because of high unmet need.

 

It is estimated that nearly half of those with this progressive and deadly disease have yet to be diagnosed.

Eliquis was another significant contributor to our results as we continued to claim greater share in a growing oral anticoagulant market.

 

Now, let me briefly wrap up.

First, I’d like to thank my more than 80,000 colleagues for the dedication they are showing each day to our purpose of delivering breakthroughs that change patients’ lives.

 

We are confident in our business.

With our focus and execution, along with our deep expertise in driving innovation and advancing our pipeline, we believe we are on track to deliver on our full-year financial commitments in 2024.

 

I walked through our progress with three of our strategic priorities and now Dave will cover our work to expand margins by realigning our cost base and allocate capital to enhance shareholder value as he discusses our financial performance and outlook.

With that, I’ll turn it over to Dave.

 



Dave Denton

Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone.

 

As we close out the first half of the year, I’m very pleased by our second quarter results.

We continue our relentless focus on execution, demonstrating our ability to both protect and grow our core brands while also continuing to advance our science-led transformation by investing in key TAs to build durable franchises.

 

Our initiatives to right size OpEx and reduce cost of goods will result in a more efficient organization, setting the stage for strong capital returns and long-term improved shareholder value enabling our commitment to both maintain and to grow our dividend.

This morning, I will briefly review our second quarter results including some one-time items, touch on our capital allocation priorities, and wrap up with an update on our 2024 financial guidance, our key priorities, and expectations for the remainder of this year.

 

Turning first to Q2 performance versus the same period last year; let’s walk down the P&L.

Total company revenues for the quarter were $13.3 billion, reflecting operational growth of 3%.

 

Our revenue and cash flow continue to be impacted by the post-pandemic COVID environment on a global basis but to a much lesser extent than prior quarters.

Looking at the business excluding our COVID products, we demonstrated strong commercial execution across the enterprise, resulting in 14% operational revenue growth in the quarter.

 

Performance was positively impacted by our continued focus on key products and geographies; refined allocation of commercial field resources globally; and further optimization of our marketing resources into key priority areas.

Contributing to this performance was our acquired products from Seagen as well as Nurtec, alongside in-line products Vyndaqel, Eliquis and Xtandi.

 

As expected, dampening our growth in the quarter were Xeljanz and Ibrance.

Adjusted Gross Margin for the second quarter was 79%, compared to 76% last year, and was primarily the result of favorable sales mix from our non-COVID products, as well as continued strong cost management across our manufacturing network.

 

Improvements in our gross margin rate will continue to be a focus for the company over the next few years as we execute on our recently announced Manufacturing Optimization Program.

This new program and together with our cost realignment program is focused on returning the company to pre-pandemic operating margins on a mix adjusted basis excluding Comirnaty.

 

Phase 1 of the Manufacturing Optimization Program, which focuses on operational efficiencies, is well underway now.

This first phase is expected to deliver approximately $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2027, some of which is anticipated to be realized beginning in 2025.

 

Total Adjusted operating expenses increased by 5% operationally to $6.3 billion and include spending from our legacy Seagen business.

Looking at the components, adjusted SI&A expenses increased 8% driven primarily by marketing and promotional expenses for recently launched as well as acquired products.

 

Adjusted R&D expenses increased 2% operationally driven primarily by increased spending related to the acquisition of Seagen, partially offset by lower spending primarily the result of our cost realignment program.

Q2 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.01 and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.60.

 

Unique one-time items included in our GAAP results and excluded from our adjusted results, this quarter include a $1.3 billion charge related to our Manufacturing Optimization Program primarily for severance, and a $230 million charge for IPR&D asset impairment and other related costs associated with the discontinuation of our DMD program.

Additionally, we expect to record a charge of approximately $400 million in the third quarter of 2024 after a decision was made in July to sell one of our facilities as a result of the discontinuation of the DMD effort.

 

Now let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value.

Our strategy consists of maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return; and finally making value enhancing share repurchases after de-levering our balance sheet.

 

In the first half of 2024, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend; invested $5.2 billion in internal R&D; and as expected, the completed business development activity was minimal.

Our commitment to de-levering our capital structure to a gross leverage target of 3.25 times remains a key priority.

 

In support of that goal, year-to-date, we have paid down approximately $2.25 billion in maturing debt, including $1 billion in May of outstanding notes.

And though we did not monetize any Haleon shares in Q2, we expect to resume monetization of our 23% Haleon stake in the future.

 

I would also note that once our Haleon ownership is less than 20%, our accounting will transition from recording equity income and will no longer be included in our adjusted results.

This change is factored into our long-term financial planning and as well as our guidance.

 

As we’ve previously stated previously, we expect operating cash flow to be significantly below typical levels this year and particularly during the first half of 2024, due to the timing of certain payments and one-time expenses.

We expect heavily weighting of revenues to the fourth quarter as our business has become more seasonal in nature with the potential that a high level of cash collections may carry over into Q1 of 2025.

 

Despite this near-term pressure, clearly, our objective remains to return to a more balanced capital allocation strategy over time.

Now, let me spend just a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of the year.

 

We entered 2024 focused on delivering on our financial commitments as well as commercial performance.

With a successful first half now complete, we believe it is appropriate to update our full year earnings outlook to reflect our strong business performance.

 

I’ll remind you that our revised guidance assumes the seasonal cadence of our product portfolio, and that we expect Paxlovid results to trend with infection rates.

With that said, we are raising our full year revenue range by $1 billion and our adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.30.

 

We now expect revenues in the range of $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion and operational revenue growth excluding COVID products is projected to be 9% to 11%.

COVID product revenues are now expected to be $8.5 billion for the year; $5 billion for Comirnaty and $3.5 billion for Paxlovid.

 

Our guidance for adjusted SI&A and adjusted R&D remains unchanged while our effective tax rate on adjusted income is now expected to be approximately 13%; and, lastly, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.65 primarily reflecting the increase to the top line and the revised tax rate among other items.

As a reminder, our EPS guidance includes an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, largely due to financing cost.

 

In closing, we remain on track to deliver at least $4 billion of net savings from our cost-realignment program by the end of this year.

This improvement in our cost base alongside our new initiatives focused on manufacturing is expected to put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns.

 

Additionally, our continued focus on execution and our recent investments have positioned the company for continued success moving forward.

This quarter’s results are a testament to the performance of our commercial business and our prudent approach to improving our cost base.

 

Though we’ve had a strong first half, we do not take lightly the continued focus needed to deliver in the second half considering the seasonality of our respiratory products.

We are clearly striving to bring about improved performance on both the top and bottom lines through focus, execution and delivering on our near-term commercial and financial goals.

 

2024 is clearly a foundation year for Pfizer.

Our achievements to date sets the stage for generating compelling shareholder value.

 

Through our science-led transformation, we will methodically build off this base and with breakthroughs and innovation driving growth in the back half of the decade.

And with that, I’d now like to turn it back over to Albert to start our Q&A.

 



Albert Bourla

Yes.

 

Thank you, Dave.

Let’s start the Q&A session.

 

Operator, please assemble the queue.
Operator

[Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from Louise Chen with Cantor.

 

Please go ahead.



Louise Chen

Hi, thanks for taking my questions.

 

So I wanted to ask you on danuglipron, when do you expect to see the actual efficacy data and if this product moves forward as anticipated, how hard would it be for you to manufacture?



Albert Bourla

Mikael, you want to address it very quickly.

 



Mikael Dolsten

Yes.

 

We are, as Albert said in the oral remarks, doing the dose optimization for PK and formulation to select potential doses for pending data progression to Phase 3 and we expect to share that first quarter.



Albert Bourla

Yes.

 

Thank you very much.

Let’s move to the next question.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.

 



Mohit Bansal

Great.

 

Thank you very much for taking my question.

And just thinking about the cost guidance, cost measures here, just wanted to understand, how should we think about the margin expansion for the rest of the year.

 

And then how should we think about it going forward in 2025 and 2026, especially as you head into the IRA territory?



Albert Bourla

Perfect question for Dave.

 



Dave Denton

Yes.

 

So Mohit, just a couple of things.

As you recall in my prepared remarks, we are focused on actually launched our manufacturing optimization program, the result of which will begin to yield results in 2025 and to generate over $1.5 billion in savings by 2027.

 

As we think about margin expansion, just given the guidance that I provided for the balance of this year, it would imply that margin – gross margin rates would actually improve versus the low-70s color that we’ve given previously to probably mid-70s at this point in time.

We do expect that all these investments, both our cost realignment program and our investments from a manufacturing optimization program are all designed to improve operating margins to get us back to pre-pandemic levels in the near future.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Dave.

 

Operator, the next question, please.
Operator

Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.

 

Please go ahead.



Terence Flynn

Great.

 

Thanks for taking the question.

Was just wondering, had two on the new product cycle side, how are you guys thinking about this upcoming RSV season?

 

As we think about patients coming back in for a booster, as well as maybe an existing new group of patients coming in.

And then on Elrexfio and myeloma, can you give us any color on the launch, either sales or market share there?

 

And if you're still confident in that $4 billion opportunity, thank you.



Albert Bourla

Yes.

 

Thank you, Terence, and very good questions.

RSV, why don't Aamir and then Alexandre speak about the Royalty?

 

And then Chris, you covered alerts.



Aamir Malik

Hey, Terence, it's Aamir.

 

For Abrysvo, I think we are very well positioned going into the fall season in the U.S.

for three main reasons.

 

One is contracting.

So we've significantly strengthened our contracting position.

 

Many of those decisions were confirmed shortly after the June ACIP and are set to take effect in August, commensurate with the beginning of the season.

The second is the ACIP guidance itself, with a recommendation for a single dose for all adults over 75 and those 60 to 74 that are at increased risk.

 

We think that is just clear and strengthens the directive for those who are eligible for a vaccine.

And then thirdly, is just Abrysvo itself.

 

We've got great data, including two seasons of durable efficacy data.

As Albert alluded to earlier, we have both our current needle free reconstitution kit that is never required to be frozen or thawed, as well as our new active biosystem, which offers many advantages and including 80% storage efficiency, so there's good options for customers.

 

And I will also remind you that there's many healthcare providers and pharmacies that prefer simplifying their vaccine management by having one vaccine for both older adults and maternal, which only a Abrysvo can offer.

So the combination of contracting, the ACIP guidance and the value proposition of Abrysvo positions as well in the U.S.

 



Albert Bourla

And Alexandre, what about international markets.

 



Alexandre de Germay

Yes, Terence, good question on Abrysvo.

 

We are making great progress as well on the international fronts following the approval, remember, in the second half of 2023 in Europe and in the UK.

We already are progressing nicely with vaccine technical committee recommending positively Abrysvo.

 

So we got positive recommendation in the UK, in France, in Canada, in Australia and several other markets and in Saudi Arabia as well.

So we are moving very nicely.

 

Delighted that actually UK authority have selected Abrysvo for RSV prevention in older adults as well as in maternal immunization for pediatric for the next two years with an option of additional two years.

And we also were selected in Canada specifically also for adult vaccination.

 



Albert Bourla

Good news for file and let's go to Chris now.

 



Chris Boshoff

Thank you for the question on Elrexfio.

 

As you saw, we recently demonstrated the updated median overall survival data for Elrexfio in the intent to treat 123 patient population in the late-line disease, where we see an overall survival of 24.3 months, which we believe is differentiated.

Elrexfio also have a differentiated profile in terms of the safety profile as well as other factors including subcutaneous administration, flat non-weight-based dosing and a flexible dosing regimen overall.

 

We've now launched in 16 countries and in fact in Japan, we were the first to launch and it's early days.

We've also recently got approval in the EU and UK.

 

In the U.S., total demand is plus 40% growth sequentially quarter-over-quarter and early next year or during 2025, you'll see the readouts for the bigger opportunities, which is MagnetisMM-5 in the double-class exposed population and then later in the year, potentially MagnetisMM-32, which is post-CD38.

So overall, we remain confident that we've got a very differentiated molecule that could become a backbone across the continuum of care for multiple myeloma.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Chris.

 

Operator, next question please.
Operator

The next question comes from Alex Hammond with Bank of America.

 



Alex Hammond

Thanks for taking the question.

 

On Nurtec, can you walk us through the commercial strategy to expand share and acute and preventive usage, as well as the international markets.

You've mentioned focusing on physician awareness in a different way and reducing friction for patient access any more color you can provide there.

 

Thank you.



Albert Bourla

Thank you.

 

Great questions.

Aamir and then Alexandre.

 



Aamir Malik

Alex, on Nurtec in the U.S., I think there are a number of things that we've done in the first half of the year to strengthen our demand.

 

So we revamp all of our consumer activation efforts.

We sharpened the clinical value proposition and how we communicated that, including, but not only limited to the fact that we have an indication for treatment and prevention.

 

We also realigned our field forces to ensure that we're really maximizing activation of both primary care and neurologist providers.

And then we made a lot of efforts through the co-pay support and other means to just reduce friction in patients actually getting access to Nurtec once a script is written.

 

And so what you see this quarter for us is a combination of all of those things starting to take effect.

So Nurtec TRx was up 28% over the prior year.

 

Revenues were up close to 39% in the U.S.

We maintain leadership from a TRx and NRx perspective at 49% and 48% share, respectively.

 

And there were 9,000 new Nurtec writers.

So that's about 85% of all new CGRP writers.

 

So as we look forward, we continue to see strength in Nurtec demand.

We'll continue to manage the gross to net dynamics of that business, but we are optimistic about where we take it from here.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you.

 

Alexandre?



Alexandre de Germay

Yes.

 

On the international front, we also have expanded access and the numbers of countries that we have introduced the product.

As you know, the growth that you see in the second quarter versus the first quarter of 2024 is really the effect of the introduction of Nurtec in China at the beginning of this quarter.

 

As of today, we have Nurtec reimbursed in 15 countries, including some of our key markets like UK, Spain.

And what we see is once we get reimbursement, we had a significant uplift of the demand.

 

And so our focus now is to increase access and reimbursement in some of our key markets.

Moving forward, we see significant growth behind Nurtec.

 

And the reason behind that is there is to the international level, less than half of the diagnosed patients that are treated with prescription medicine.

So that's why we think we have an opportunity with Nurtec.

 



Albert Bourla

And I believe, Alexandre, that this year, we got almost 55 countries registered Nurtec in international markets, 55 markets on [indiscernible] 15 received already reimbursement, and we are waiting for the remaining 40 to receive reimbursement.

 

Let's move to the next question.
Operator

Our next question comes from Akash Tewari with Jefferies.

 



Akash Tewari

Hey, thanks so much.

 

On next-gen Prevnar, your team has been fairly quiet on its profile.

Let's say that the next-gen product only hits 27 serotypes and not 31 like some of your peers.

 

Why should we feel confident that Pfizer can retain a lion's share position in this market?

And you mentioned the next-gen product actually having the largest serotype coverage.

 

Does that imply greater than 31 serotypes of coverage?



Albert Bourla

Mikael?

 



Mikael Dolsten

Thank you.

 

As you know, we have worked over several decades in optimizing how to expand the number of serotypes while maintaining strong immune responses for as many as possible.

We have not disclosed yet how many serotypes we have.

 

We have recently pursued expansion of that next-gen into Phase 2 of both pediatric and adult and look forward to adult data to come quite soon, which will allow us to move swiftly in that indication.

We have made significant improvement on existing and new serotypes through new technologies.

 

And that is a deep capability.

So it's not just about having the highest number of serotypes.

 

It's really to show the consistency and the data before you can draw any conclusion.

So we remain very confident in our ability to defend our leadership position and continue to expand it through these new technology tool bots.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you very much, Mikael.

 

Next question, please.
Operator

We'll take our next question from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.

 



Chris Shibutani

Thank you.

 

I want to ask you about your views on the IRA, in particular, implications on revenue outlook for 2025 and 2026.

Obviously, your employees, your partner Bristol on Eliquis made commentary that I think has been interpreted by the Street as being that this is a dynamic that could be manageable.

 

We appreciate your specific reflections on the Pfizer portfolio.

Thank you.

 



Albert Bourla

Thanks, Chris.

 

I will ask Aamir to speak a little bit about the Eliquis specifically.

And then, Dave, can you cover the general impact of IRA?

 



Aamir Malik

Chris, as you noted, BMS led the discussions with CMS on Eliquis maximum fair price because they are the NDA holder, and they shared their perspective on that process during their earnings call last week.

 

Honestly, we don't have much to add to what they said.

We share their view that we have the ability to navigate the impact of IRA on Eliquis.

 

And Eliquis will be an important drug in our portfolio for the foreseeable future.



Dave Denton

Yes.

 

And then I would just add to that, as we look at IRA across our platform, first, I think we were very fortunate Pfizer that we had one product selected.

And secondly, if you look at the remaining products that are likely to be – that could potentially be selected, they are nearing the end of their patent protection life.

 

So if you think about it from a net present value perspective, the impact on Pfizer is somewhat muted as you think about it economically.

I will say this is a piece of legislation that clearly is harmful for supporting research and development in the sector.

 

So we're hopeful that this could be changed in the future, but we will continue to actively manage our way through this.



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Dave.

 

Operator, next question, please.
Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners.

 



Dave Risinger

Yes, thanks very much.

 

And I guess I just wanted to start off by saying congratulations and best of luck to you, Mikael.

So my questions are, first, could you please comment on your expectations for Phase 1 obesity candidates beyond once-daily danuglipron, including disclosures to watch over the next several months?

 

And then second, Dave, could you just contextualize the $1.5 billion in COGS reductions relative to the current annual run rate of about $15 billion?

It seems like you're going to cut 10%.

 

But how should we think about net reduction i.e., net COGS declines over the next three years?

Thanks so much.

 



Albert Bourla

Yes.

 

Mikael, why don't you give a little bit on the obesity candidates other than danu?



Mikael Dolsten

Yes Yes.

 

As you heard from Albert, danu is the more advanced drug with a large tolerability, safety and efficacy experience.

As always, in our projects, we have additional drugs in the same class.

 

It's in Phase 1, performing as expected.

We have another mechanism of action that would combine with Oral GLP [ph] such as danu later in development of life cycle.

 

And we have other mechanisms to protect part in kidney that could also be part of an internal medicine, larger cardiometabolic franchise.

Thank you.

 



Albert Bourla

And what about the cost reduction?

 



Dave Denton

So let me just anchor us on a few facts here.

 

First, the cost reduction effort that we currently have initiated is Phase 1 of a multiple-phase program.

So this $1.5 billion savings is only a part of – or a piece of the story.

 

We will tell more of the story as we define the program more specifically so you get more clarity on that.

Secondly, if you look at the $1.5 billion cost improvement effort, and you think about that on our cost of goods sold platform, where it's probably closer to $16 billion versus $15 billion, this is at anchor point.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you.

 

Operator, next question please.

We'll take our next question from Kripa Devarakonda with Truist Securities.

 



Kripa Devarakonda

Hey guys, thank you so much for taking my question.

 

I have a question on the RSV in maternal market.

How has – have you gained traction in the maternal market?

 

Are you seeing any sort of setbacks?

Just wondering if Pfizer needs to educate, build out or do some groundwork before the market really breaks open.

 

And then a follow-up question on PADCEV, there are other radioligands and ADCs that are targeting Nectin-4.

Are there – how do you see the competitive landscape shaping up?

 

Thank you.



Albert Bourla

Aamir about maternal RSV.

 



Aamir Malik

Sure, Kripa.

 

So thanks for the question.

I think let me start by just underscoring the interest that we see on maternal vaccination.

 

So when you talk to OB/GYNs, there's a clear preference that they have to vaccinate during pregnancy.

And similarly, you hear the same from pregnant mothers.

 

Greater than 60% prefer vaccination versus vaccinating the baby, maternal vaccination.

So our launch on maternal did exceed our expectations.

 

So we saw uptake rates through the end of January with about 11% of eligible mothers taking the vaccine.

And that is significantly higher than other maternal immunization at the same point in the life cycle.

 

I think key Tdap was less than 2% at the same time.

So the other thing I will note is it does require education, as you know.

 

And last year's maternal ACIP recommendation occurred just after the RSV maternal vaccination season began.

So this season, we have the benefit of using the first half of the year to invest in that education of both HCPs as well as pregnant women, and we look forward to the season ahead.

 



Albert Bourla

And international anything to add?

 



Alexandre de Germay

Yes, very, very few points.

 

Just to say that following the approval, we also have great progress on the vaccine technical committee on vaccination in maternal in the UK we receive positive recommendation as well as in France, in Australia, Belgium, Austria, Argentina, so many other, including an interesting one, which is the power for Latin America.

And now we are progressing into access – final access into those markets.

 



Albert Bourla

And about the competitiveness of Padcev, Chris?

 



Chris Boshoff

Thank you for the question.

 

We’re very pleased that in this quarter, as you’ve seen, we printed just shy of $400 million for Padcev with sequential quarter-over-quarter growth of 15%.

Based on the claims data through the end of May, we are seeing U.S.

 

first-line share increasing into the low 50% range.

And as you know, the next opportunity is obviously in muscle invasive bladder cancer with two ongoing studies being conducted by Merck, which can expand the population to an additional 28,000 addressable patients.

 

So overall, we are seeing that Padcev with pembrolizumab is becoming entrenched in the first-line setting as the standard of care and future studies, including future nectin-targeted medicines, radioligands or ADCs will likely have to do studies against Padcev plus pembrolizumab in the first-line setting, which could be challenging.



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Chris.

 

Next question, please.
Operator

Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS.

 



Trung Huynh

Hi guys.

 

Thanks for the questions.

Firstly, on Prevnar, there wasn’t so much commentary in your prepared remarks here.

 

Just interested for the quarter, was that impacted by any one-offs?

And has there been any stocking dynamics or destocking at play here, given the approval of [indiscernible] and that anticipated launch?

 

And then secondly, just at ASCO, we saw some early KAT6 data in breast.

The presenter was very, very excited.

 

Can you perhaps talk about the opportunity here?

How quickly can we get this through clinical studies?

 

And when can we see the next set of longer-term data?

Thanks very much.

 



Albert Bourla

Aamir, what about this, the stocking?

 



Aamir Malik

Yes.

 

So on Prevnar, I’ll just provide context on the U.S.

performance dynamics.

 

So the change year-over-year is predominantly a result of lower adult demand due to shrinkage of the opportunity size in that market.

And the quarter-to-quarter change that you see is a function of the CDC order timing for pediatric vaccines, which tends to be quite lumpy as well as some of the adult vaccination dynamics of both shrinkage and seasonality.

 

And I think it’s important to continue to think about these two segments very differently in the U.S.

So with pediatrics, as Albert had mentioned in his remarks, we exited Q2 with a share of 81%, which is up 71% in August.

 

And then the adult market continues to behave differently in the U.S.

in that it is contracting because there are just fewer eligible 65-plus adults and a more difficult-to-activate younger population.

 

And that’s the same population that Merck’s V116 will be launching into.



Albert Bourla

And in the international market?

 



Alexandre de Germay

International, as you see first quarter, second quarter together for the first half, we grew by 2%, and this is in line with our expectation.

 

What we see is, of course, we are going to capitalize on the very strong franchise that we are in Prevnar 13 with 140 exclusive NIP around the globe.

And so as we get Prevnar 20 pediatric we are going to launch this product and switch from 13 to 20.

 

Now in adults, it’s a very interesting dynamic because in adults, our vaccination was in Europe and outside of the country is quite limited.

Now that we see Prevnar 20 registered and validated by VTC, we see significant pickup.

 

And let me give you an example.

In Germany, we got VTC recommendations for 60 and above, all-comers and at risk, from 18 to 59.

 

And there, in Germany, since the beginning of the year, we see significant growth.

We see that we will have similar trends in other major markets in Europe.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you.

 

And Chris?



Chris Boshoff

Thank you very much for the question on KAT6.

 

KAT6 is a first in category medicine.

We’re very proud that this medicine was conceptualized and discovered at our laboratories in Ohio.

 

As you’ve seen with the most recent data, objective response rate over 35% durable responses and well tolerated.

We therefore plan to initiate a Phase 3 program over the next six months, and you’ll learn more about that.

 

But thank you for the question.

We’re also excited about KAT6.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you.

 

We are very excited about it.

Next question, please.

Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays.

 



Carter Gould

Good morning.

 

Thank you for taking the question.

I guess first one, just a clarification.

 

I guess when we think about the PK danuglipron data, the top line, on a month ago, are we going to see any of that data prior to the dose optimization data reading out early next year?

And then as we think about timelines for danuglipron, some of your European peers have talked about potentially moving faster.

 

And I think some of the timelines that are generally thrown out there, including potentially reaching market as early as 2028.

Did Pfizer have sort of similar plans or think such plans would be feasible for danuglipron?

 

Any color on that front would be helpful.

Thank you.

 



Albert Bourla

Mikael?

 



Mikael Dolsten

Yes, for your questions, we’ll likely present a comprehensive data set on PK after collecting all the data from the two studies, but we are looking into what’s the best way to sharing it timely.

 

We have some of the most aggressive timelines when we agree a protocol with regulatory agency and pending data.

And as Albert has said, if that becomes the case that we move forward pending data, you can bet that like every Pfizer program, it will be very fast.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Mikael.

 

Next question, please.
Operator

The next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.

 



Chris Schott

Great.

 

Just two questions for me.

Just coming back to danu again.

 

I guess just bigger picture, do you expect the once-daily formulation will have an improved tolerability profile versus the twice daily?

And maybe part of it as we think about the additional data you’re getting, will you get additional efficacy or tolerability data from these ongoing studies?

 

Or is it really just PK, just as you’re trying to make a decision here.

I just want to try to better understand what you’re going to have available to consider?

 

And then the second question I had was just on RSV.

It sounds like some encouraging contracting updates.

 

But can you just elaborate a bit more on the market as a whole?

Is this a market you expect to grow in the U.S.

 

this year is on one hand I’m balancing more visibility on who should be targeted and covered post ACIP.

But at the same time there's no revax recommendation yet.

 

And there could be maybe some challenges for pharmacies trying to figure out who's high risk and who's not in that 60 to 74-year old population.

So just like balance those two together, do you expect the market as a whole is growing this year?

 

Thank you.



Dave Denton

Chris.

 

Given that, for the interest of time let me tell you about Daniel.

We have said it multiple times that is going to be PK data right now.

 

We have done with Daniel 1,400 pace, so we feel very comfortable about the profile, we know the product.

Right now the question is if we have a formulation that will allow us to take this product into Phase 3 registration enabling studies.

 

We made an announcement because we feel that what we saw from the first round of testing multiple formulations, we felt encouraged that we have several that can deliver and one, but it was the preferred one and it is the one, but because it was the best of all, and now we are going to test it.

Also we can speculate if tolerability will be better or not because of once a day compares to twice a day because we don't have the data.

 

But as whis [ph], I said in my prepared remarks for DANUBE, the profile that the DANUBE right now has based on the 1400 patients that we have seen is very competitive both on tolerability and efficacy.

With whatever we have seen from others in the oral space so far.

 

And in terms of timing, right now with everything we know we are the only one with 2b data on an oral GLP-1 after, of course, Lilly.

So right now for everything we know, we should be the second after Lilly if DANUBE progressed into registration enabling studies.

 

Now let's go to RSV, Aamir.



Aamir Malik

So Chris, what I would say is we are only in the second season now of a expanding market, right.

 

So you had the first season last year, this year with the ACIP recommendation.

As I mentioned earlier, we think that that provides clarity and it strengthens the need for those identified in the recommendation to get a vaccine.

 

And we've had another six months plus of opportunity to educate HCPs as well as consumers, and we see growing relevancy and urgency of people to vaccinate.

So we do think that the opportunity set expands.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you.

 

Operator, next question.
Operator

The next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.

 



Tim Anderson

Thank you.

 

Going back to IRA, so CMS is bound to make the disclosure of negotiated prices on this first list of ten drugs a very big production, it will claim it's a major win over the industry.

Of course, it depends on how those prices compare to net prices, not list.

 

My understanding is it's possible we get this news from CMS earlier than September 1st, possibly this week ahead of the congressional recess in early August.

Do you agree it's possible we might get this news early?

 

Thank you.



Albert Bourla

I don't know.

 

They have the decision making, so they will do what they think.

I can't comment on that.

 

I know have discussed that thing, but – so I will emphasize once more, if CMS says that that was a big win for them against the pharma industry, what I would say it was the whole law of IRA.

It is a very big loss for innovation and for the crown jewel of American industry, which is the Life Science Technology business.

 

But it is what it is.

It is the law of the land.

 

And we are doing our best to make sure that we minimize any impact, particularly in the future, because for now, as Dave said, we were probably in the next few years, the NPV [ph] that are at stake for us, It's quite small because most, we were fortunate not to have up to four products selected only one.

Next question, please.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen.

 



Steve Scala

Thank you so much.

 

Two questions.

First, do you expect VYNDAQEL to grow up to the LOE or will competitors pressure sales and take majority share before that?

 

Certainly seems VYNDAQEL faces some significant challenge?

And secondly, assuming no booster doses, does Pfizer still peg peak RSV vaccine sales at 2 billion plus?

 

That was guidance first provided in December 2022 and do you think you can capture a majority share this fall?

Thank you.

 



Albert Bourla

Aamir, why don't you take the first one?

 



Aamir Malik

Sure.

 

So Steve, on VYNDA maybe what's going on now and then what's to come with competition.

So VYNDA is continuing to grow at a very healthy clip.

 

This is a result of multiple factors, a very important one of which is we focused on expanding our HCP base that we're targeting as well as really investing in diagnosing and identifying patients.

Diagnosis remains the biggest unmet need in this condition because there's almost half of patients that are still undiagnosed.

 

So we do see a lot of growth opportunity in VYNDA.

Now for this year it may not continue as the same clip that we've seen in Q1 and Q2, because we had a big bolus of enrollment patients in the beginning of the year, partially as a result of some of the IRA reforms, and the incremental diagnoses become harder and harder to find.

 

But we do expect continued growth with VYNDAQEL.

As far as competition, there's still a lot that needs to be understood exactly about the competitors, their data, their profile, what actions they're going to take.

 

But what I will say is that we obviously welcome more treatment options for patients, but there's a lot that we're very confident in with VYNDA.

There's a body of clinical evidence that includes five-year follow-up clinical trial data, and real world evidence including statistically significant mortality and CV hospitalization data that is in our label, as well as quality of life benefits that we think continue to position VYNDA well.

 

But of course, with competition coming in, we will take that into consideration and provide further guidance as things evolve.



Albert Bourla

Thank you.

 

And again, in the interest of time, Steve, for the RSV, when we provided $2 billion was in the frame of a pipeline asset.

What is the key potential annually?

 

We don't give once the products are registered, typically projections not even for the next year, not for the peak years, but what I would say if everything – if anything, things have become more promising since the time that we gave this $2 billions, because we were all surprised how much the medical community and the recommended authorities are putting emphasis on the disease.

So that's my comment.

 

Sorry I couldn't be more specific to you.

Next question, please.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities.

 



Vamil Divan

Great.

 

Thanks for taking my questions.

Maybe a couple I could.

 

One, you talked about the aggressive timeline that obesity.

I assume for PCV next-gen, it's similarly aggressive.

 

Maybe you just comment on sort of the time you think it would take to get that product to market, given you're now in Phase 2, and then the second one is more related to Paxlovid.

In the first quarter, you had the big adjustment and you came in well above expectation, but to not raise the guidance now this quarter, you are raising the guidance.

 

I'm curious if you can comment on anything you're seeing, sort of in the channels or what driving the confidence to raise the guidance now and then so tied to that, is that the main driver of, sort of the increased gross margin?

So expectations.

 

And is that just the product mix and cost management sort of combination, but just seeing if you can maybe parse out some of the main drivers of that impact.

Thank you.

 



Albert Bourla

Yes.

 

For the next-gen, I’ll make it easy.

We announced that we entered into Phase 2 studies, both in pediatric, and so one can calculate, you can't comment how long we take because these are event-driven studies, particularly when you go into Phase 3, right.

 

So we don't know how long that will take, but.

And we don't comment at this stage, but let's go to Paxlovid and explain the dynamics, Aamir.

 



Aamir Malik

Yes.

 

So for Pax in the U.S., you pointed to the momentum in Q1, which I'll remind you was a combination of both the true-up as well as ongoing utilization that was very high given the wave of COVID infection.

What happened then is in the first half of Q2 infections were low.

 

And the very clear trend that we see with Paxlovid is when there is a COVID infection wave, we have healthy Paxlovid utilization.

So starting in May, all the way through June, there was increased COVID infection waves and our Paxlovid utilization followed.

 

So we had about 35,000 treatment courses a week in April and May, peaking to about 100,000 in June.

So we have seen continued utilization.

 

Now it is trickier for the wholesalers and end customers to manage utilization around the disease.

That's a little bit unpredictable.

 

So we did enter Q2 with higher than normal inventory levels, but the wave of utilization that we've seen in Q2 has helped normalize those inventory levels.

And all of this dynamic combined with the fact that we've built a commercial model to successfully get Paxlovid to those who need it, including very healthy coverage with commercial payers, 90% of pharmacies across the U.S.

 

already participating in our USG PAP program, and a simplified model for delivering that PAP program to patients when there is a COVID infection wave.

We're confident about Paxlovid utilization.

 



Albert Bourla

Yes.

 

Thank you, Aamir.



Dave Denton

And just real quickly, as you think about the guidance, I think your question was, was this, what was driving our improvement and guidance?

 

This was one of many factors because our core business in general is doing quite well and our cost management programs are really taking hold.

So this is one of multiple factors that drove that $0.30 raise.

 



Albert Bourla

Thank you, Dave.

 

And also Vamil, I realized that I misspoke before when I said that it is event-driven, the next-gen.

It is not.

 

It's immunogenicity.

Also, I can offer another point for you to try to estimate the timelines that next year, we expect to have the regulatory discussions about how the program should look like, and then we will form better understanding when we can have the Phase 3 readout.

 

Next question, please.

And I think the last question, operator last question, please.

 

We cannot hear the operator.

Sorry for this technical problem.

 

The technician just told me to wait a moment, please.

Otherwise we will stop the call here.

 
Operator

We'll take our final question from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.

 



Evan Seigerman

Hey, guys, thank you for squeezing me in at the end.

 

I would love for some comments on VYNDAQEL given the strength this quarter; you really came in ahead of consensus.

Do you expect this continuing in the back half of the year into 2025, and just given the IP in the next couple of years expiring, what can you do to extend this, given the strength of this franchise?

 

Thank you so much.



Albert Bourla

Aamir?

 



Aamir Malik

Hey, Evan.

 

So, a bit as I mentioned earlier, yes, we do expect to see continued growth momentum for VYNDA in the back half of this year and going forward for the reasons I described earlier.

It may not be at the level that we saw in the first half of the year because of the Q1 bolus of patients, but the combination of what we're doing in terms of physician expansion, investment in driving diagnosis, and tailwinds from IRA reform do give us conviction around short term VYNDAQEL growth.

 



Albert Bourla

Yes.

 

And when it comes to, IP right now, it's very difficult, once the product is getting generic, to be able to fight with a new molecule unless you have substantial differentiation.

And, VYNDAQEL has tremendous efficacy.

 

So we do not expect that the market will continue being as big, particularly for us, after we see generics entering into it.

So thank you for the question.

 

So I want to make some just closing remarks that we had a very strong first half of the year, and we are confident that we will deliver on our full year financial commitments in 2024.

We are driving progress with solid execution as we continue to serve patients and grow our business, execution makes the difference.

 

Thank you for your interest in Pfizer, and we hope you have a wonderful.

Nick Stone

Hello everyone.

 

Welcome to today's call and webcast.

The presentation was sent to our distribution list by e-mail today, and you can also find it on gsk.com.

 

Please turn to Slide 2.

This is the usual safe harbor statements will comment on our performance using constant exchange rates, or CR unless stated otherwise.

 

Please turn to Slide 3.

Today's call will last approximately 1 hour with the presentation taking around 35 minutes and the remaining time for your questions.

 

Today, our speakers are Emma Walmsley, Tony Wood, Luke Miels, Deb Waterhouse, and Julie Brown, with David Redfern joining for Q&A.

Please ask 1 to 2 questions so that everyone has a chance to participate.

 

Turning to Slide 4.

I will now hand the call over to Emma.

 



Emma Walmsley

Welcome to everyone joining us today.

 

Please turn to the next slide.

I am delighted to report that GSK's momentum this year continues with excellent second quarter performance.

 

Sales grew 13% to £7.9 billion.

Core operating profit was up 21% to £2.5 billion and core earnings per share rose 17% to 43.4p, all excluding COVID solutions.

 

This reflects our continued focus on operational execution and the strength of GSK's broad portfolio to prevent and treat disease.

Sales growth was reported across all 3 product areas for the first half.

 

For the second quarter, vaccine growth was driven by international expansion.

Specialty Medicines, in particular, were up strongly, growing over 20%, reflecting successful new launches of Ojjaara in myelofibrosis, Jemperli in endometrial cancer and long-acting HIV treatments, and we also delivered a record quarter for strategy in General Medicines.

 

All of this demonstrates the strength and breadth of our portfolio to deliver competitive and profitable long-term growth.

This strong sales performance has been underpinned by effective cost control, driving operating leverage and further margin improvements this year.

 

And these benefits are also delivering improved operational cash flow providing funds for pipeline investments as well as returns to shareholders.

Our dividend for the quarter was 15p.

 

And on the basis of our current performance and prospects, we are again upgrading our full year guidance.

Next slide, please.

 

We continue to invest in the pipeline and are making good progress.

This quarter, GSK's long-standing expertise and leadership in respiratory will once again reinforce with positive Phase III data reported for depemokimab.

 

In oncology, we continue to progress material growth opportunities, most notably the presentation of positive second line combination data for Blenrep to treat multiple myeloma.

In Vaccines, Arexvy was first again with the approval by the FDA to prevent RSV disease in adults aged 50 to 59 were at increased risk.

 

Although ASIPs postponed vote on recommendation for this cohort are surprising, we have to remember, this is a brand new vaccine.

We look forward to sharing the additional data requested and more and remain very confident that the benefit of Arexvy can offer to this age group like other cohorts will be fully recognized and that this best-in-class vaccine will reach its full sales potential.

 

I'm also delighted we've taken steps forward in clinical development for our pioneering ultra long-acting HIV medicines or potential functional cure treatment for hep B and on novel antibiotic gepotidacin.

Next slide, please.

 

Build and trust by delivering across the 6 key areas we prioritized at ESG remains a clear priority for all of us at GSK.

Earlier this month, in partnership with medicines malaria then we launched faenoquine in Thailand and Brazil.

 

This is the first single-dose radical dual medicine to prevent malaria relapse, another step forward to eliminating this disease.

In May, we became a founding partner of the Fleming initiative, a new global network that proves together scientists, proxy makers and the public to fight antimicrobial resistance.

 

And we've also started a Phase III trial for a low carbon version of our metered dose inhaler Ventolin, using a generation propellant on new inhaler has the potential to reduce emissions by around 90% versus the current one.

and benefit millions of people with asthma.

 

Please turn to Slide 8.

So I am delighted with GSK's continued progress and strengthening prospects, but before reminding you of these, a quick word on Zantac, given the ruling we have on admissibility of evidence this letter.

 

This Daubert ruling in Delaware does not determine liability and our position remains unchanged.

We will continue to defend against the claims being made.

 

And our aim, as it has been all along is to manage this in the best interest of the company and shareholders and to stay focused on our delivery.

As many of you know, we started this year by setting out new upgraded long-term commitments, and we're all focused on delivering against all of these short, medium and long term.

 

With our current momentum and the continued progress we're making, we have today upgraded our outlook for 2024, demonstrating the strengthening depth and breadth of our portfolio.

We now expect to deliver sales growth of 79% and core operating profit growth of 11% to 13% for a short-term shift in mix that the team will comment on.

 

For 2026, we continue to expect more than 7% sales growth and more than 11% core operating profit growth on a 5-year [indiscernible] basis.

Until 2031, we continue to expect sales of more than £38 billion with a broadly stable margin through the loss of exclusivity of dolutegravir.

 

And remember, these outlooks do not yet include the launch of Blenrep or ongoing progress in our early-stage pipeline.

So I'm now going to hand over to Tony to talk you through our R&D progress in more detail.

 



Tony Wood

Thank you, Emma, and welcome, everybody.

 

Next slide, please.

As you know, our approach in R&D is to invest for growth in new best-in-class vaccines and medicines, combining our scientific focus on the immune system with the use of advanced technologies.

 

Today, our pipeline comprises 70 assets in clinical development, and my priority remains the acceleration of the delivery of new vaccines and medicines for patients and to drive future growth for GSK.

In the past 6 months, we secured regulatory approvals or received acceptance of submissions for 10 major medicines and vaccines and reported positive data from 7 Phase III studies, clearly demonstrating the innovation and health impact that GSK is now bringing to patients.

 

Focused business development has continued as well.

We strengthened our respiratory pipeline with the acquisition of Aiolos Bio for their long-acting T-slip antibody anticipated to start Phase II in 2025, and we gained full control of our candidate mRNA vaccines by restructuring our collaboration with CureVac.

 

Accompanying these were investments in 2 new technology platforms the acquisition of LC Biotechnologies, which will help accelerate our oligonucleotide program and an agreement with OkraBio that will create foundational liver biology data sets deepening our understanding of disease and improving target identification.

In all, we've advanced the pipeline across all our core therapeutic areas.

 

And importantly, we're on track with the development of the 12 scale product opportunities as well as Blenrep that we highlighted at the start of the year.

These all have the potential to deliver profitable growth in the 2026 to '31 time frame and to support our 2031 ambition of more than £38 billion in sales.

 

I'll now take a closer look at a few important areas.

Next slide, please.

 

First, in vaccines, where preventing seasonal viral and high-risk bacterial diseases remains a key focus for us.

We have an extensive development plan for Orexo and continue to see this exceptional vaccine as a major long-term growth opportunity.

 

Arexvy is the world's first RSV vaccine and has demonstrated outstanding efficacy in adults of various ages, including more than 94% during the first season, for people with comorbidities and who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease.

In June, ACIP recommended use of Arexvy all adults aged 75 and over.

 

And for adults aged 60 to 74 who had increased risk from severe RSV disease.

The committee unexpectedly postponed a vote in adults aged 50 to 59 requesting additional data.

 

These include evidence from vaccine surveillance databases to further support the benefit/risk profile observed during clinical trials in a real-world setting.

We look forward to contributing to these data over the coming months.

 

I'm also looking forward to the data from studies 006 and 004, assessing efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of Arexvy over 3 RSV seasons.

These data will be important to help answer some of the questions raised by ACIP on outcomes and duration of protection.

 

As a reminder, season 2 data showed 75% cumulative vaccine efficacy against severe lower respiratory tract disease over 23.3 months.

These data support the strong and durable protection that this uniquely adjuvanted vaccine offers against RSV.

 

Later this year, we're also looking forward to sharing more from trials in adults aged 18 to 49 who are at increased risk from RSV disease.

Next slide, please.

 

Next, a comment on the interesting data for Shingrix.

So we shared yesterday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Philadelphia.

 

These data add to the growing body of evidence exploring the observed association between shingles vaccination and a reduced risk of dementia.

Our study was prompted by a number of observations, some of which are summarized on this slide.

 

There's a growing body of evidence largely generated from retrospective case studies in very large populations that herpes zoster vaccination is associated with a reduction in the diagnosis or onset of dementia.

These data include a recent observational study in Wales, which concluded that vaccination with a live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine was associated with a 20% reduction in dementia diagnosis when compared to people who did not receive the vaccine.

 

Using an AI/ML approach and data from Optum's electronic health record data set, we constructed a retrospective observational study comparing matched cohorts of adults vaccinated with Shingrix, a competitor live attenuated shingles vaccine and a comparator pneumococcal vaccine.

Headline data shown on the right-hand side of this slide suggests that after 3 years, Shingrix was associated with a 27% reduced risk of acquiring dementia when compared with the competitors zoster vaccination and a 24% reduced risk of dementia when compared to the comparative pneumococcal vaccine.

 

The potential relationship between shingles prevention and risk of neurodegeneration is an area of increasing interest to the scientific community.

These are interesting early results, which we are investigating with additional retrospective and mechanistic studies.

 

Next slide, please.

Turning now to respiratory.

 

We're making good progress with novel treatments that could provide more effective options for severe asthma, COPD and refractory chronic cough.

Depemokimab is the first ultra long-acting biologic engineer to have high affinity for IL-5.

 

It enables sustained inhibition of type 2 inflammation with twice try dosing versus current options, some of which require injections every 2 weeks.

This quarter, we announced the 2 pivotal Phase III trials in severe asthma with an eosinophil phenotype SWIFT 1 and SWIFT 2 met their primary endpoints demonstrating that 2 doses of depemokimab adminsted over a 12-month period showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in significant exacerbations versus placebo in combination with standard of care.

 

We're looking forward to sharing full data at the ERS conference in September, and we remain on track to file the medicine for approval later this year.

Depemokimab's development program is being informed by predictive biomarkers and phenotyping, which has enabled us to progress 4 clinical indications in parallel.

 

The pivotal ANCA 1 and 2 trials in one of these chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps are now closed for recruitment with data expected later this year.

We also expect to see Phase III data on the use of Nucala and COPD this year and Phase III data for camilipixant in the treatment of refractory chronic cough in 2025.

 

Next slide, please.

You'll shortly hear from Deborah on the important advances in our HIV pipeline.

 

So I'll conclude with a brief summary of the strong progress we've made within the oncology portfolio during the first half.

We're building an emerging and high-potential portfolio of new medicines with a growing focus on ADCs, immuno-oncology and targeted small molecules.

 

For Blenrep, pivotal data from the DREAMM-7 and DREAMM-8 studies presented at ASCO demonstrate the potential for Blenrep to become the new standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma in the second-line setting.

These trials will serve as the basis for regulatory submissions, and we are pleased that EMA recently accepted our first filing for this indication.

 

Additional filings are planned before the end of the year.

Also stated the recent mid the management event, we plan to start a Phase III trial in the first-line setting in early 2025.

 

For Jemperli, recent data from the RUBY trial demonstrated a statistically significant overall survival benefit in an all-comer population with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.

Jemperli is the only immuno-oncology agent to demonstrate a survival benefit in this patient population.

 

These data have been filed with the FDA, and we anticipate a response ahead of the 23rd of August PDUFA date.

Carefully targeted Phase III trials investigating these in Jemperli in the treatment of rectal lung and head and neck cancers are also ongoing.

 

The first half of 2024 also saw a number of oncology indication trial starts, including Galaxy 301 and a Phase III trial investigating our TIGIT antibody, belrestotug, in combination with Jemperli in the treatment of first-line PD-L1 high non-small cell lung cancer.

The glio-focused Phase III study, which will investigate Zejula in the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma and a Phase I study of our B7-H4 ADC JSK584, which recently entered the clinic.

 

We're looking forward to seeing more data from our ADCs by the end of the year to inform pathways for accelerated registrations.

Finally, we're pleased to announce the recent Japanese approval of Ojjaara with a line-agnostic label for all patients with myelofibrosis.

 

So in summary, a productive first 6 months to 2024.

I'm pleased with the progress we're making to deliver differentiated health impact for people and patients.

 

And I'll now hand over to Luke.



Luke Miels

Thanks, Tony.

 

Please turn to the next slide.

In Q2, we delivered growth across all our product areas and regions with £7.9 billion of sales, up 13% versus last year, excluding private solutions.

 

This includes another strong performance in the U.S.

with growth of 17%.

 

Please turn to Slide 17.

Vaccines sales grew 3% in Q2, excluding COVID solutions.

 

This performance was impacted by short-term factors and we fully expect the underlying strength of the business to continue over the long term.

Globally, Shingrix grew 7% year-to-date but was down 4% in the quarter, delivering £832 million.

 

Outside the U.S., sales grew significantly and represented 64% of Q2 revenue.

Shingrix has now launched in 45 markets, the majority with less than 5% penetration, and these markets represent a source of future growth for this vaccine.

 

Q2 growth was driven by a national immunization program in Australia, expanded European public funding and supplied to China.

Supply phasing to China is now expected to be delivered evenly across the second half with 40% of our grid full year supply delivered to date.

 

In the U.S., sales decreased by 36% in the quarter due to 3 factors: the first channel inventory reductions; and secondly, important changes in retail vaccine prioritization in part due to a transition to a new CMS rule effective the 1st of January '24 that changed how pharmacies process reimbursements and payers.

These 2 short-term effects are not expected to repeat in the second half of this year.

 

And thirdly, lower demand driven by challenges activating harder to reach consumers.

Addressing this remains a priority with cumulative penetration of people aged 50 and older, reaching 37%, up 6 points since the same time in '23 based on latest census data.

 

We've more than 70 million adults that are still unvaccinated and recommended to receive our vaccine.

We're focusing our resources and marketing content on targeting these eligible potential patients.

 

Our expectation continues to be that Shingrix' global sales will grow this year and reach more than £4 billion by 2026 driven by growth outside the U.S.

Turning to RSV.

 

Nearly 8 million people have been vaccinated with Arexvy since launch, and we are maintaining around 2/3 of the retail vaccination share.

As expected, demand levels were lower in Q2 due to seasonality.

 

Ahead of the 2024, '25 RSV season, we're well positioned in our contracting and still expect blockbuster level sales in 2024.

These sales are expected to be second half weighted with the vast majority in the U.S.

 

And following the ACIP recommendation, we received a universal recommendation in 75-plus roads, but now expect minimal sales in the 50 to 59 age group this year with further potential impact in those age 60 to 74 years.

Preparation for launches in Europe and international are underway for 2025 and beyond with the best-in-class data profile, we're confident Arexvy will return to growth next year and longer term can achieve more than £3 billion in peak year sales.

 

The meningitis Q2 sales for Bexsero and Menveo were up 23% and 30%, respectively.

Bexsero continues to demonstrate strong growth, benefiting from favorable pricing in the U.S., recommendation in Germany and increased demand from Australian immunization programs.

 

Menveo grew due to favorable delivery timing in international markets and U.S.

CDC purchasing patterns, including our candidate MenAB.CWY vaccine, our meningitis portfolio, is expected to deliver around $2 billion in peak year sales.

 

Given the first half performance and our latest expectation with a tough comparative for Arexvy and U.S.

Shingrix in the second half, we now anticipate vaccine sales in the full year to increase by low to mid single-digit percent.

 

Our increased 2026 CAGR outlook for vaccines of low double digits has not changed.

Next slide, please.

 

In specialty medicines, including HIV, which Deborah will cover next, we had a very strong quarter and increased sales by 22%, excluding COVID solutions.

And our expectations for the year, I'm pleased to say have increased.

 

Nucala was up 17%, driven by higher patient demand for treatments addressing a sinophilic-lead disease market expansion and increased buyer penetration.

Benlysta was up 20% in the quarter driven by buyer penetration growth from early intervention in SLE and lupus nephritis.

 

We're also seeing growing demand in the U.S.

and continued consecutive double-digit growth outside the U.S.

 

In oncology, sales again more than doubled in the quarter.

In hematology, we're continuing to see a strong update for Ojjaara, which launched in the U.S.

 

last year and in the U.K.

and Germany in Q1.

 

In gynecological cancers, continued momentum was primarily driven by sales in the U.S., Germany, France and the U.K.

in the first line dMMR/MSI high primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.

 

In addition to growth from second line and later treatment, Jemperli is the backbone of our immuno-oncology development and pending regulatory decisions and development beyond dMMR-driven shippers, which will drive future growth.

ZEJULA's growth continued in Q2, driven by the U.S.

 

and volume growth globally.

As a reminder, for the next quarter, we will not benefit from the stocking of -- or the switch to the new tablet formulation as seen in Q3 '23.

 

Given the 21% sales growth in the first half, we're increasing our full year expectations, and we now expect Specialty Medicines to grow mid- to high-teen percent with the second half growth being lower due to tougher comparisons in oncology.

Please turn to Slide 19.

 

Focusing on Nucala for a moment.

The chart on the left of this slide demonstrates Nucala's continued leadership in IL-5 market share and pleased to say that Nucala continues to grow by double digits quarter-on-quarter, despite being on the market for almost 9 years.

 

We anticipate our IL-5 portfolio comprising depemokimab and Nucala to deliver more than £4 billion in peak year sales.

Next, looking at Ojjaara.

 

We're still seeing the fastest U.S.

launch uptake in value for a JAK inhibitor in myelofibrosis.

 

The only treatment to demonstrate clinical and durable benefit on spleen response symptoms and anemia for myofibrosis patients with anemia.

We're finding anemia burden to be increasingly at the forefront of treatment decisions.

 

We continue to improve our market share.

65% U.S.

 

and EU healthcare professionals expect to increase prescribing Ojjaara in the next 6 months.

Please turn to Slide 20.

 

Finally, General Medicines grew by 12% in Q2, reflecting a record quarter for Trelegy, with sales increasing 41% to £842 million.

Around half the growth was driven by channel and segment mix as well as adjustments to returns and rebates, which were expected to moderate in half 2.

 

Trelegy also benefited from share gains and remains the top-selling brand in asthma and COPD and is the most prescribed single inhaler triple therapy worldwide.

Removal of the AMCAP on Medicaid drug prices in the U.S.

 

had expected to impact branded versions of Advair, Flovent and Lamictal.

However, increased use of authorized generic versions of Advair and Flovent offset this impact in the quarter.

 

Given the strong start to the year, we now expect General Medicines sales to increase low to mid-single-digit percent for the full year.

I'll now hand over to Deborah to cover HIV.

 



Deborah Waterhouse

Thank you, Luke.

 

Next slide, please.

We're pleased to see continued strong performance and sustained double-digit growth in Q2, delivering 13% revenue growth.

 

Our growth is driven by continued strong patient demand for our industry-leading medicines which has led to an increase of 2 percentage points in global market share versus Q2 2023.

Our oral 2-drug regimens and long-acting injectables continue to transform the HIV marketplace.

 

Dovato delivered sales of £551 million in the quarter.

The strong body of clinical data and real-world evidence reinforcing the efficacy and durability of this medicine continues to grow.

 

At the International AIDS conference last week, results of the PASO DOBLE study a large head-to-head randomized clinical trial of Dovato compared against the 3-drug regimen, Biktarvy, showed non-inferior efficacy and significantly less weight gain.

This is important because we know people living with HIV are concerned about taking more medicines as they age as well as the long-term risk of metabolic diseases that can come with weight gain.

 

Our long-acting portfolio also continues to perform strongly, delivering more than 50% of total HIV growth.

Cabenuva grew 42%, driven by patient preference and proven and durable efficacy.

 

CASM LATITUDE data presented at CROI and data from real-world cohorts that include over 10,000 people living with HIV in diverse settings has resonated strongly with physicians and has supported increased breadth and depth of prescribing.

Apretude grew more than 100% in the quarter.

 

This medicine has demonstrated proven superior efficacy compared with daily orals and a positive safety profile and high patient preference.

As a reminder, the registrational HPTN 084 study of PrEP in women was the first to show 0 infections in participants who received injections as described per protocol.

 

We believe that long-acting therapies are the future of HIV care, empowering people impacted by HIV with choice and addressing the barriers standing in the way of reaching the end of the HIV epidemic.

Looking at the long-acting market, we can see that the treatment market is currently approximately 10x larger than the PrEP market at about £20 billion, which will have a significant impact on the sales potential for long-acting options.

 

In the long-acting inject for treatment setting, there are no competitor launches planned before 2028.

We continue to see strong progress across our pipeline.

 

At the AIDS Congress, we shared first time in human data for our third-generation integrated inhibitor, VH184, demonstrating strong efficacy and a unique resistance profile.

Building on our strong legacy of developing powerful integrated inhibitors, these positive findings reinforce that integrated inhibitors will remain the gold standard in HIV, trusted for their efficacy, long-term tolerability and high barrier to resistance and make VH184, an excellent candidate for further development for both ultra long-acting and self-administered therapies.

 

In PrEP, we have committed to move forward with our registrational studies for cabotegravir ultra long acting Q4M with confidence in the efficacy and safety profile.

In treatment, we've selected rilpivirine as a partner for cabotegravir ultra-long-acting Q4M.

 

This regimen collection is based on progress in formulation studies for rilpivirine and builds on existing positive patient and physician experience with these medicines in our current portfolio.

We remain on track to deliver the first ultra long-acting 4 monthly treatment regimen in 2027 and 4 monthly dosing options for prevention in 2026.

 

We continue to progress our ambition of extending the dosing interval of our long-acting regimens to enable every 6-month dosing towards the end of the decade.

Our strong performance over the first half gives us confidence to increase our guidance to low double-digit percentage growth in 2024.

 

With that, I will hand to Julie.



Julie Brown

Thank you, Deborah, and good afternoon, everyone.

 

Next slide, please.

Starting with the income statement for the second quarter with growth rates stated sales increased 13%, as Emma mentioned, reflecting continued strong business performance, particularly within oncology, HIV and Trelegy within general medicines.

 

.

Core operating profit grew 21%, excluding COVID and 18% overall.

 

Operating profit grew ahead of sales as we continue to focus on disciplined resource deployment and delivery of a competitive P&L.

Core EPS grew 17%, excluding COVID.

 

Turning to the total results.

Operating profit decreased 22% to £1.6 billion, predominantly reflecting charges arising from the CCLs, primarily due to improved longer-term prospects of our HIV business and less favorable foreign currency movements.

 

Next slide, please.

Moving to the core operating margin.

 

This increased 190 basis points to 31.9% year-on-year, excluding COVID.

This reflected cost discipline the drive of productivity improvements and targeting resources to the key commercial and R&D assets in the business.

 

In addition, the gross margin benefited from positive regional mix.

These factors were partly offset by the impact of the loss of Gardasil royalties, as guided.

 

In the first half, we saw a significant margin improvement of 380 basis points at CER to 32.5%, with strong operating leverage underpinned by 13% sales growth, gross margin mix benefits and a one-off favorable impact relating to the Zejula royalty dispute.

Next slide, please.

 

Cash generated from operations in the first half was £2.8 billion, representing an improvement of £0.9 billion versus half 1 last year.

This was primarily driven by core operating profit growth and favorable working capital with the latter benefiting from higher receivable collections.

 

Free cash flow was £0.6 billion relative to an outflow last year, and therefore, improving year-on-year by almost £1 billion.

As usual, we expect to generate the majority of our free cash flow in the second half of the year given the seasonality of the vaccine business.

 

Next slide, please.

Slide 26 shares our net debt position since the 31st of December and how we've actively deployed capital in the business in line with our capital allocation framework.

 

Net debt was £1.1 billion lower compared to the end of 2023 at £14 billion, and this included the monetization of our remaining stake in Helion.

We have a strong balance sheet to support continued investment in future growth, including business development as we look to deploy funds to enhance growth and deliver attractive shareholder returns.

 

And now with that, I'll turn to our latest full year expectations.

Next slide, please.

 

Given our strong start to the year and continued momentum, we are pleased to upgrade our 2024 guidance today.

You heard Luke and Deborah refer to our updated product guidance.

 

And in summary, the strong upgrades to Specialty Care and General Medicines more than offset our lower expectations for vaccines this year.

In abrogate, for full year 2024, we now expect group sales to increase between 7% and 9% and core operating profit to increase between 11% and 13%, notwithstanding the loss of Gardasil royalties which will reduce profit growth this year by 6 percentage points.

 

Turning to the P&L.

The gross margin has been strong in the first half.

 

In the second half, we expect to incur costs to drive future supply chain efficiencies as well as lower positive mix benefits given the phasing of the launches last year.

In addition, we continue to expect SG&A to grow at a low single-digit percentage and we now expect R&D spend to increase slightly below sales growth and royalties for the year to be around £600 million.

 

Core EPS is expected to grow 10% to 12% due to an increase in the tax rate under OECD legislation.

I am confident in our underlying business momentum.

 

But obviously, the second half growth rates are very different from the first with the second half significantly impacted by the very strong launches of Arexvy and in oncology last year as well as the initial stock builds.

In addition, Gardasil was stronger in half 2 last year, which will impact our profit growth in this upcoming second half.

 

In summary, we are pleased with our first half performance and confident in achieving our upgraded full year guidance as well as all of our medium and longer-term outlooks.

Next slide, please.

 

Turning to our IR road map, which shares our progress towards major milestones and value unlock opportunities.

As you can see, we have made good progress in the first half.

 

In the second half, there are a number of major milestones expected, notably in respiratory.

First, the presentation of the detailed SWIFT 1 and SWIFT 2 data at the ERS congress for depemokimab in the treatment of severe aspirin patients with a eosinophilic phenotype.

 

Second, the Phase III data readout of depemokimab for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.

And finally, the Phase III data for Nucala in COPD.

 

We also look forward to our next meet the management event at the end of the year, which will be the first introduction to our early-stage pipeline.

And with that, I will hand back to Emma to conclude.

 



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Julie.

 

So to summarize, GSK continues to deliver on its commitments and perform to a new standard.

Our excellent performance in Q2 underpins the strong momentum across the business.

 

We're pleased to be upgrading guidance and expect 2024 to be another meaningful year of growth in sales, profit and earnings as we continue to focus on prevention and changing the course of disease for millions of people.

We're confident in delivering our growth commitments and we continue to progress with development of meaningful innovation in our core therapy areas.

 

Our strong momentum underscores our confidence, the same profitable growth through this decade, deliver scale health impact and attractive returns for shareholders, combining science, technology and the talented GSK people to get ahead of disease together.

With that, I'll now open up the call for the Q&A with the team.

 



A - Nick Stone

Thanks, Emma.

 

We're going to take our first question from Peter Verdult, Citi.



Peter Verdult

Peter Verdult, Citi.

 

Two questions, please.

Just firstly, Emma and Luke, I'm sure you're going to get a lot of questions on this, but let's just head it straight off.

 

In light of the vaccine dynamics that you are calling out today, and yesterday's comments from Pfizer and Merck.

Can I just push you a little more on firstly, what you're seeing in China, when you think realistically you can return U.S.

 

Shingrix to growth I realize that's sort of a difficult question to answer, but I'll try.

And then lastly, how are you feeling about the contracting for 2024 U.S.

 

RSV in both the retail and non-retail channels?

And then a very different and quick question for Tony.

 

Just can you remind us why GSK still has enthusiasm for the TIGIT mechanism in light of disappointing competitor data sets?

Is there any differentiation that you want to call out on EOS-448?

 



Emma Walmsley

Thanks very much, Peter.

 

Well, let's go to look on all 3 of those.

I just would refer you back to his introduction earlier today, we -- the update has shown some short-term impacts on our vaccines portfolio.

 

But we remain very confident in our medium-term outlook and the strength of our products today and their prospects as well as the pipeline that continues to develop in vaccines.

But Luke, both on China, U.S.

 

Shingrix, and I know great confidence in the contracting for the season.



Luke Miels

Thanks, Peter, and I suspect you're not Robinson Crusoe with these questions.

 

So I'll spend a bit of time on it.

I mean, firstly, on contracting, very happy.

 

Based on what we can see, we will retain market leadership.

We're on track to be a blockbuster.

 

We can cover ACIP a little bit later on.

But yes, I think we're very happy with the work that's been done by the team on the ground there.

 

In terms of vaccines in China, Look, I mean, I think at a macro level, we're extremely happy with the partnership we've started with [indiscernible].

This is a strategic partnership.

 

This is a long-term partnership.

The start-up process for Shingrix has been completed in Q1.

 

We have reps on the ground as of the end of May.

And if you just look at numbers, they've already expanded from 6,000 points of vaccination that we were covering.

 

They've already hit 19,000 and are on track for around 27,000 by the end of the year.

So scale of that company and the impact that they can bring to -- for Shingrix in China is clear.

 

Now in terms of broader vaccine demand, we did see some softness in servers, but it's confounded by the fact that we moved resources off the product as well.

We do hear some signs that some of the local CDC do have tighter budgets.

 

And this is something we're going to watch very, very closely.

But for us, the key here is that Shingrix is at a very different point in the life cycle to HPV vaccines.

 

We're just getting started here.

So we've got the best possible partner.

 

We'll build the opportunity.

If you look at the opportunity, it's very similar to the U.S.

 

When you look at people in China that can pay out of pocket and that are in key cities.

So the numbers are very large, but we need to build that.

 

We've just shipped the 60% of the remaining will ship the rest of the order.

In the second half, we did have a delay of shipment, not demand-based.

 

-- but we just booked another £94 million in July.

So we're on track to fill the full contract for the year.

 

So that's China.

If we get on to the U.S.

 

and Shingrix growth I mean basically for the full year in Shingrix, we're not going to grow versus last year, but the second half, obviously, is going to be stronger than the first half.

If I just expand on the 3 factors.

 

And the first 2, let me be really clear, these are half 1 dynamics.

So we've moved through them.

 

The first one is wholesaler, as I said in my earlier comments, that delta is about 300,000 doses.

So we finished quarter 4 '23 with 700,000 in the wholesaler and that's typically what we like.

 

As I've said on previous calls, in Q2, it went down to around 400,000.

So that was -- that's something though that we expect to be rebuilt as we go into the flu season.

 

The second factor was CMS rule changes covering direct and indirect remuneration on DIR fees.

And just as background, these are basically discounts pharmacies pay Medicare PBMs and plans spotters certain quality measures are not met.

 

And the complication has been historically the PBMs can request these retroactively for up to 6 months from the point of sale.

So that's obviously a complication for the pharmacy and the pharmacy group.

 

The new rule that was brought in remove retroactive -- the retroactive part.

So basically, at the point of sale, all of these components had to be booked and visible.

 

And what that meant was for the 6 months, so from January to June, there was just less incentives for [indiscernible] to vaccinate patients.

And we saw them shifting volumes between different types of vaccines to offset that.

 

We've now moved into the second half of the year.

We look at market research, tracking, et cetera.

 

TRx trends adjusting for 4th of July is looking very encouraging.

The key thing also, this is very much a pharmacy structural element that has expired.

 

If we look at market research for physicians, and their enthusiasm to recommend Shingrix either strongly or extremely strongly.

If you're looking at 65 plus, it's 88%.

 

So that's the same as last year.

60 to 64 is 80%.

 

So again, same as last year, 50% to 59% is around 50%.

So that's all where it was.

 

If we look at patient engagement, that's also holding overall, but that leads to the third factor, and this is something I've mentioned on previous calls.

As we penetrate this population.

 

And if you look at the rate that we've penetrated with Shingrix, is double the rate of PCV.

So we've got there in 7 years, what it took PCV vaccine to get there [indiscernible].

 

But as I said before, the most motivated people obviously sort out the vaccine, and we've been able to penetrate those populations to a very high degree.

In our #1 segment, we're around 66% penetration.

 

So we have to work harder to get less engaged people, less motivated people.

There is a huge plan to do that.

 

So we will be looking at patients which are resident in other specialties, we're looking at COVID, we're looking at comorbid ways that we can stop leakage some account management work that we're doing as well.

And then we're just really changing our marketing mix to focus on segments who [indiscernible] to activate.

 

So that's the plan.

And if you put all this together, basically, we'll expect some growth in half 2.

 

But again, we're at this evolution of really looking outside the U.S.

to Europe, Japan, Australia and China for our growth.

 

And then ultimately, once we've moved through those cohorts, we'll get to emerging markets as we've covered on previous calls.

Long story short, we can never get this and we remain confident that we could hit our £4 billion target with Shingrix in 2026.

 

So a long answer, but hopefully, that is helpful to everyone else.



Emma Walmsley

Great.

 

Thanks very much, Luke.

I really want to reiterate that confidence in the broader vaccines portfolio and the maintenance of our 26 CAGRs and excitement to the pipeline ahead.

 

but we do see the growth coming ex U.S.

on Shingrix, but the decline in the U.S.

 

to moderate.

And I would just point out Luke's presentation, that in the U.S., we absorbed about 36% decline on Shingrix and delivered whilst digesting that 17% growth in our largest country in the world.

 

So Tony and TIGIT.



Tony Wood

Yes.

 

Thanks for the question, Peter.

Your quick answer, might get a slight -- sorry, your quick question might get a slightly longer answer if you forgive in.

 

And just to remind you, we've said our focus in oncology is very much on hematological and gynecologic book answers, and we said we'll invest outside of that in a gated way.

when we see data that suggests transformational opportunities.

 

So with that in mind and TIGIT, what have we seen, what are we doing about it?

And why do we think it's happening.

 

So what have we seen in our Galaxy's 201 platform study, and this is with 120 patients, so a larger patient population than the initial data from the cityscape valuation of similar mechanisms.

What we see is similar overall response rates, but a speed and quality of response that is differentiated from those observed previously.

 

You'll hear more about that when we present on these preliminary data at the end of the year.

So I'll pause on that at this point.

 

What we're doing with that data now is moving into the Galaxy 301 Phase III study.

And an important thing to bear in mind about the characteristics of that study.

 

First of all, it's in combination with Jemperli, we're learning there from what we've seen in the [indiscernible] lung study.

It's also in a carefully biomarker-selected population, and it is with EO-448 or Beresofor those of you who haven't connected the 2 together.

 

What we expect to see as a consequence of it -- as a consequence of the differential profile for EOS-448.

It's an IgG1 antibody, which means it has a functional Fc region, the constant region of the antibody.

 

That means it engages macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer cells in the tumor microbe environment augmenting immunity.

And also, it induces something called ADCC, which is antibody-directed cellulosic and that results in the killing of T regulatory cells, which are immunosuppressive in the tumor environment.

 

We've seen that latter feature of depletion, both preclinically and clinically.

So in short differentiated data moving forward in a gated Phase III study in designed based on what we've learned from PERLA, with a molecule that we think has differential characteristics.

 



Emma Walmsley

So more to see at the end of the year and a strong focus on making those decisions.

 



Nick Stone

Okay.

 

So we're going to go to Jefferies and take our next question from Peter Welford.



Peter Welford

Sorry but I want to come back -- to the back.

 

Can we just come back to a Arexvy for a minute and just understand, Luke, particularly on the contracting.

I understand that you're very confident with the market, the intros, the share of retail, but there are 2 things, I guess.

 

So you can you just talk about the appetite and what you've had here on contracting discussions insofar as, I mean, maybe you can talk about the extensive vaccination we've seen in that 75-plus cohort about the motivation you see in that group for greater incentive year-on-year, perhaps for those to come in versus, on the other hand, the lower obviously age where there's less of a strong recommendation.

And equally, if you could just talk a little bit about then the non-retail segment.

 

What you're seeing there?

Do you see any change to that segment going into the second half of this year?

 

Or do you still anticipate that to be a relatively minor part for RSV given the recommendation that we've seen the 75-plus year olds?



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Peter.

 

So Luke, Arexvy?



Luke Miels

Peter, maybe what I'll do is I'll talk through.

 

I mean the key thing is we are confident with the Arexvy in terms of the long-term ambition of 3 billion.

And you're right.

 

I mean the G&A set was positive for 75 plus.

And if you look at our immunization rate in 2023, of that population, which our numbers, that's about 26 million.

 

Under shared clinical decision-making, we achieved an immunization rate of around 18% overall -- all products.

If you look at the 60 to 74 with ACIP, there's no way you can escape that as a negative for the class, right?

 

We have to be realistic there.

But there is some lining to the cloud, some silver lining to the cloud when we break that population down.

 

So if you look at 60 to 74 under shed clinical decision-making in '23, the amortization of rates around 13%.

Now the hard part right now, of course, is we don't know where CDC is going to set the boundaries in terms of what high-risk complications, what -- is it diabetes?

 

Or is it advanced diabetes?

So it's a bit difficult.

 

But if we just -- along the lines that you were talking about if we just look at people with other complications in that 60 to 74 group.

It's a similar number, it's about 26 million.

 

And if you look at the immunization rate that was under share clinical decision-making for the 60 to 74 population last year, it was about 16%.

If you look then a little bit more tightly at the 65 to 74 at increased risk, it was actually higher, it was 19.5%.

 

So I assume that's because we're a bit more mobile, easy to reach in the pharmacy versus care homes, et cetera.

So there's clearly in that population areas engagement, and it will just depend on how CDC sets the rules.

 

In contrast, if you look at healthy people, the penetration rates were much lower.

So it was around 11% in the 60 to 74 population at around 15% in the 65 to 75 cost of slightly more narrowly.

 

So yes, I think there's going to be more momentum for 75, but you've taken a big chunk of people out in the 60 to 74.

And what we don't know is the reaction of physicians with ACIP changes, whether they're going to withhold recommendation in some populations.

 

So it's difficult to project.

Obviously, Q3 is going to be a key.

 

And our intention is to maximize Arexvy there.

We've been very, very deliberate with this product.

 

It has been positioned from day 1 for high-risk individuals.

So -- and then when you look at PCP preference and patient preference, that's clearly the leader in the minds of physicians and patients that are aware of it.

 

And that makes sense, right?

Our data is the strongest.

 

As I said before, it's the 1 you'd give you on -- and our plan is to go back, feel free to add, Tony, is to go back to ACIP with 50 to 59 data with the updated benefit risk safety data and GBS and also when we've got the full package, the 3-year data.



Emma Walmsley

Tony, do you want to add?

 



Tony Wood

Look, let me just pick up on one point of that because I suspect we're going to deal with more questions around -- as -- but just to underscore the point in the populations that detailed.

 

We have a very strong data set, for example, in the 79-year-old, so that was a 94% vaccine efficacy in the first season and 75% across 2 seasons.

See that also with A versus B coverage.

 

So we're confident in the strength of our data and our continuing ability to add to that data centers we accrue more and sales because I'm sure we'll get more questions.



Emma Walmsley

Luke, anything you want to add on the retail channel?

 



Luke Miels

Yes.

 

Yes.

I mean historically, it's around 85%.

 

We don't see that as changing.

When you look at market research, why -- and we've obviously looked at this a lot.

 

-- when we show this change in Shingrix with the removal of the co-pay.

And when you look at patients' reasons for going to the pharmacy, from memory, it's like 58% of them site that the process is easier, the physician prepares to do that.

 

There's greater certainty around coverage and out-of-pocket costs.

So we think that structurally will remain the same.

 

As Tony said, we'll be back in with the 50 to 59.

But I think ASIP is going to be very conservative about broader coverage until they've got complete clarity in terms of benefit risk.

 

And I think that's important in the non-retail segment.



Julie Brown

Yes.

 

And it's probably just worthwhile underscoring the 50 to 59 that we see no change in bettors proposition for the vaccine relative to season 1 in that population or indeed in the broader group.



Nick Stone

Okay.

 

So we're going to go to JPMorgan and James Gordon.



James Gordon

James Gordon, JPMorgan I'll stick with the vaccines team.

 

My first question was just the vaccines guide.

So you know it quite significantly today.

 

I think it's about £700 million is the difference.

So the question how much of the downgrades are actually being lower versus Shingrix?

 

Am I working out right that it looks like the guidance roughly has actually being about flat at only in the second year in the market or even not growing maybe even be slightly down or if I miscalculated that?

And the other question was just Arexvy and revaccination.

 

So we saw the 2-year revaccination in antibody titer data at ASIP.

And the ACIP panelist was a bit cautious on the data, and I think I had a comment now that you're going to share some more data in the coming months.

 

So is that the NOI clinical trial and show the waning of protection.

So are we going to in the next couple of months have all the data that relates to whether you can get this 2-year revaccination interval.

 

And what is your confidence in getting that now we've seen some more data.



Emma Walmsley

Great.

 

Thanks, James.

Well, I'll come to Julie first to give you the building blocks of -- of the guidance of the year, remembering we are annualizing against the launch.

 

And then Tony will come to you on data and back.



Julie Brown

Thanks, Emma.

 

Yes, so in terms of the overall position with the second half, -- you probably recall the very strong vaccine performance that we had in half 2.

And the change in the guidance overall to the low to mid-single digits is primarily relating to RSV for the reasons Luke mentioned relating to the age groups and the ACIP decision making.

 

As Emma mentioned also, the stocking impact last year was fairly significant.

So you'll probably recall that in Q3, we mentioned we got $0.02 of the sales, we're actually stocking going into the channel, together with about 20% towards the end of last year.

 

So there is a very significant first half second half impact with vaccines.

You probably recall our growth rates in vaccines last year were 33% and 34% in Q3 and Q4.

 

So this is the headwind that we face now going into this period.

And I think Luke summarized it very well just in terms of the exact guidelines in terms of what they actually mean in terms of people at risk of whether it's a normal diabetic that whether it's always complications will make a big difference in the second half performance.

 



Emma Walmsley

Great.

 

Thanks, Julie.

And just to reiterate that RSV update is purely related to ACIP competitive.

 

And as Luke said earlier, we'll be looking forward to being back to great growth in -- in '25 and confident in the long-term prospects of this vaccine.

Tony, do you want to talk about the -- the data to come back this time?

 



Tony Wood

Yes, yes, sure.

 

And James, just quickly double up for the immuno study, but I want to describe this in the context of the entire data set since that's really the important aspect with regards to food to revaccination.

We've said we have 006, which is the vaccine efficacy study, 004 the immunogenicity study and the study is looking at immunogenicity, which we started, for example, in the immunocompromised population.

 

A decision on revaccination will depend on the trends in vaccine efficacy and the ability to boost that in itself depends on how the various aspects of the immunological profile wane over time.

I think we talked about this at the last call with regard to our expectations on duration.

 

And at this stage, I'd say rather than making guesses given that we're only a few months away from the whole data package that we will be presenting at ACIP, so we wait for that.

And what things stress, though, within that, for me, is what we're learning for as is a greater focus on benefit risk, and therefore, the importance, for example, offered by a longer duration vaccine, both with regards to great value and benefit risk.

 



Nick Stone

Okay.

 

I'm going to take our next question from Richard Parkes, BNP Paribas.



Richard Parkes

Nick.

 

So I've got one on Vaccines, one on Gen Med.

On Gen Med, obviously, performance has been strong.

 

I know that's partly driven by a strong strategy demand, but also better navigation of the AMP Cap removal.

So can you just talk about how much of that performance is sustainable into 2025 versus turning to a headwind, and I'm thinking about things like stocking for authorized generics, et cetera.

 

So just thinking about Gen Med performance into 2025.

Then secondly, just to push on Rx fee a little bit more.

 

Could you help us just understand how much true visibility you've got on likely second half demand based on the contracting?

And I'm just trying to compare it to maybe the flu vaccine market, where generally it feels like people have got good visibility there.

 

Obviously, with the ACIP panel recommendation happening only recently, it might take some time for retailers to digest that and predict the demand.

And obviously, that could work both ways, either additional orders for you and upside or downside through returns.

 

So could you just talk about your visibility and where the risks lie either to the upside or downside for and guidance.



Emma Walmsley

All right.

 

Well, two more questions for Luke although we will guide on '25 in '25.

And -- and there's no change to our midterm CAGR for Gen Med's obviously a great performance there.

 

So Luke, you want to start with that about?



Luke Miels

Yes.

 

And thanks, Richard.

Look, I think a lot of it is really a one-off effect of authorized generics and I'm pleased to say that we were more successful than we're expecting in terms of being able to capture those patients as they came on Advair and Flovent.

 

With Lamictal, we just took a price hit and that was very sizable.

We did that because we didn't want to disrupt those patients.

 

So the underlying growth is lower, and it's very much along the language we used in the past with General Medicines over the longer term.

I mean Trelegy itself continues to grow very strongly.

 

But of course, it did that outside the U.S.

as well.

 

I mean, Japan was up 29%, China, 26% and the EU was up 15%.

So this is an excellent medicine.

 

It's one that we're going to continue to back.

We had 10 recent presentations, publications.

 

So there's a lot of momentum there.

But yes, again, we'll start to lap that -- those components of shifting and the movement with authorized generics in the second half of this year and '25, I won't comment on.

 

In terms of clarity, I mean, the key difference structurally is with flu, we do a lot of pre-booking because there's a manufacturing cycle, it's a new product every year.

It's definitely softer this year.

 

If we look at flu volumes.

They were higher than normal in the first half in the U.S., but Southern Hemisphere was weak.

 

So it's not a really good surrogate with -- with Arexvy, don't have guaranteed volumes.

We've got guaranteed percentage splits, which I won't go into, and that's why I'm quite happy about where we landed.

 

And I think the other factor is pricing.

You've got these contracts with good prices, and that was very, very important to us when we take a long-term view on what is an excellent asset.

 



Nick Stone

We're going to come to Graham Parry at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

 



Graham Parry

Sorry, it's more on Vaccines.

 

But whether actually, you said about having U.S.

market leadership in the second half on volumes, and you said you sort of have a good idea of split.

 

So can you help us understand, I think up to this point, you've been 2/3 of the volume for this season, Pfizer started contracting a bit earlier, you've had denied the market.

So is 2/3 what you'd be aiming for?

 

Or should we be just thinking about having the majority of the market even?

Or is it less than that?

 

And then secondly, on your peak sales of £3 billion and return to growth in 2025, does that assume that you are going to have some sort of best regimen in there can you get there by just rolling out globally?

And if you could help us understand on the boosters with the season 3 vaccine efficacy data for a single dose that you're expecting in the second half?

 

I think your modeling data on the all-comers population has suggested that the single administration could drop to around 40% in season 3, which would certainly warrant a booster, but in the populations you're now recommended for the over 75s and the comorbid.

It looks like those are much higher in the 70s in season -- across season 1 and 2.

 

So do you have any sort of predictive modeling data of where vaccine efficacy on those target populations might drop to that would perhaps allow for best to be recommended?



Emma Walmsley

So Luke, and then we'll come to Tony on basic.

 



Luke Miels

Sure.

 

Graham, I won't give you a percentage, but it's market leadership.

I think what is not visible to us yet is how much Moderna picked up relative to Pfizer.

 

But we know how much we've picked up, and that's why we're using the term leadership.

I think the other thing, of course, one thing is volume, but it has to be multiplied by price.

 

And that's something else that will be more visible in time to the aggregate revenue.

In our forecast, we assume that a booster is required Tony, I'll hand over to you for the rest of that.

 

.



Tony Wood

Yes.

 

And look, Graham, I'd say at this stage, what I've done.

It is really -- this is a matter of waiting and seeing.

 

Otherwise, I'm drawing straight lines between 2 points to get an estimate of where season 3 is bearing in mind that the dynamics in season 1 and season 2 were very different.

And as I mentioned earlier in answering Graham's question, and I think it's not just a combination of vaccine efficacy, but also the boost response to.

 

So we'll know more about that when we get ready for ACIP not COVID.



Nick Stone

So we're going to take our next question from Tim Anderson at Wolfe Research.

 



Tim Anderson

A non-vaccine question.

 

which is an Zantac [indiscernible] obviously, in our investors downstream of the Delaware ruling.

I know Glaxo will say it will continue to depend itself it lots of studies in your paper, but in the theoretical event laxer to enter into a broad settlement to try to put all of this behind the company, what's realistically, the earliest this could happen.

 

Is it safe to assume that would not be possible until 2025 possibly well into 2025?



Emma Walmsley

Thanks, Tim.

 

And [indiscernible], we do absolutely recognize the impact this litigation has had on shareholders.

And you're right, by I am going to start by reiterating the fact and the science here, which is total scientific consensus that there is absolutely no consistent or reliable evidence the initiating increases the risk of any cancer.

 

And so we're going to continue to vigorously defend ourselves against all of the claims and manage the litigation in the best interest of the company and of shareholders.

That's been our focus all the way along.

 

And we are confident that we have done so in the process.

And that means no change to our growth agenda.

 

No change to our guidance.

No change to our investment plans.

 

Our position is based on science and facts.

And our focus is to address this in the interest of shareholders and the company.

 

And -- as I'm sure you know, there is obviously a limit towards I can say around this litigation since we need to respect the judicial process and protect the interest of the company.



Nick Stone

Can we go to Mark Purcell at Morgan Stanley.

 



Mark Purcell

Just a few questions.

 

Firstly, on China and vaccines, are you seeing much in the way of emerging domestic competition I think CHT has a shingles vaccine, for example.

And in that respect, what's the appetite from [indiscernible] to extend the agreement to Arexvy.

 

On Arexvy business.

It's been suggested that revaccination only achieves 45% to 65% of peak neutralization titers due to immune interference from the T4 fold on trimerization [indiscernible] which is used by Arexvy and rise as well.

 

So I just wondered if it's the factor and if we've seen this sort of before.

And the last one, in terms of Nucala, ahead of the COPD [indiscernible] data late Q3, Q4 I think, Tony, you've described the efficacy is likely to be in the low 20s in terms of reducing exacerbations.

 

Sanofi CSPs a £5 billion peak potential across its 2 assets.

So I just wondered if you could help us understand how large the opportunity you see is for your IL-5 focused medicines?

 



Emma Walmsley

Well, we'll come to look quickly on China.

 

I mean, we point that's quite hard really on top to come up against Shingrix with an effective vaccine, and we've got 18% efficacy for 11 years.

But -- and then we'll come to Tony on both the booster question and Nucala and the broader opportunities in COPD in the pipeline, please.

 

Tony.

So Luke first.

 



Luke Miels

Yes.

 

Thanks, Mark.

I mean there is a local competitor to Shingrix.

 

It's a company called Gunway.

It's a live attenuated vaccine.

 

So it's afterback its license is 40-plus.

But they get around 1/4 of the volume at this point.

 

But again, these are very different patients, the ones that we're targeting.

We're targeting high out-of-pocket tolerance, willingness to pay population, which is different.

 

In terms of Japan rand relationship there, as I said earlier, it's excellence.

It's a strategic long-term relationship.

 

And we have had some initial discussions around RSV, and we would very much like to expand the collaboration to include RSV.

So just watch this space.

 



Tony Wood

Yes.

 

Thanks, Mark.

Just quickly then on the T4 construct.

 

This is obviously something we spotted and were eager to understand as well.

The short answer to that, although we haven't disclosed the data there's no evidence of interference.

 

What is a much more likely and common explanation for the boost is the relative waning in the vaccine efficacy in the first instance and it's generally understood that the greater the waning of efficacy or greater the boost.

So you'll see more on the folding question when we disclose those data.

 

In terms of COPD and IL-5 and -- let's just start by putting your comment with regards to dupilumab versus that into context, sorry, you color into context.

I've mentioned this in the past, and I appreciate there's a lot of sort of comparative numbers flat -- floating around.

 

What's important is, I said, based on the patient population that we've targeted in our Phase III study in Matane, which is a broader population and includes and for seeming patients.

These represent about 30% of the COPD population, so a significant proportion of the approximately 300 million individuals with COPD.

 

That population is more difficult to treat even in the high eosinophilic setting.

And because of the different patient mix and based on what we've seen in the past, that's where my prediction for sort of mid-20s, low to mid-20s percent for Matane comes from.

 

It is not a reflection of relative efficacies of the 2 molecules.

What we -- what both matters are showing is that there is a significant response for those with COPD and high yield counts in this instance, in particular, over 300 caps.

 

We're very well placed in the COPD arena and evaluation of not just IL-5 but the mechanisms.

I would point to, first of all, of course, we're looking forward to the progressing on epi with once every 6-month dosing.

 

That is a significant advantage in COPD, even greater than it is in severe asthma.

And in addition to that, T-slip offers a broader opportunity in the risk data from Amgen in COPD with that slippage and albeit with a much lower with a much more frequent dosing regimen, of course, [indiscernible], suggests that we should also have opportunity there.

 

I'll pause, but there are additional aspects of our COPD portfolio that I look forward to telling you about in the future.

.

 



Nick Stone

We'll take the next question from Emily Field at Barclays.

 



Emily Field

I'll just ask two quick ones.

 

One on ex-U.S.

Arexvy, one of the things that Pfizer talked about yesterday in terms of their ex U.S.

 

contract wins was a desire to simplify the contracting between having one option for a turn on older adults.

I know this year is mostly going to be U.S.

 

driven for Arexvy.

But is that something that you see as an obstacle to ex-U.S.

 

Arexvy.

And then just on the HIV guidance, third year in a row of expecting double-digit growth in HIV.

 

You have your CAGR target of 6% to 8% still intact.

Are there any reasons to expect a slowdown in the next couple of years in HIV or why not upgrade that guidance?

 



Emma Walmsley

Thank you.

 

Well, let's get to Deborah first on HIV, and then we'll come back to get any further comments on Arexvy from Luke.



Deborah Waterhouse

Yes.

 

Thanks for the question, Emily.

So I think in quarter 1 and actually reiterated on Friday when we did our update post the age conference.

 

We are tracking towards the top of our guidance.

As you say, we've had 3 years of double-digit growth.

 

Next year, we have the headwind of the IRA.

We've stated very clearly that that's going to be around a £200 million impact.

 

And then obviously, we've set out very clearly in 2026, what we think the shape and the size of our portfolio is going to be.

So we should be reaching £7 billion if not slightly above, which is what we've kind of shared with you all in 2026.

 

And then by 2027, obviously, we are moving into a world where we've got 40% of our portfolio in our -- in portfolio value and long acting.

So I think at the moment, everything that we've said '21 to '26 holds firm, we are at the top end of that CAGR.

 

And then as we move into 2027, we remain extremely confident that the long-acting medicines in our portfolio will be 40% of our total revenue, if not more, because obviously, we're having a very successful period with those medicines at the moment.

So -- so no change in our guidance, but just I think your feeling or increased confidence because of the feedback we get from physicians and patients as to the impact that our long-acting medicines are having and the growing momentum for those medicines.

 



Emma Walmsley

It's great to see the progress in the pipeline on you've been announcing just through into last week too.

 

Yes.

So Luke?

 



Luke Miels

Thanks, Emily.

 

The short answer is no.

I mean, typically, the way the contracts and NIPs are constructed as they separate pediatric populations from adult populations and really what counts.

 

And it's different to ACIP, of course, is the systems are willing to concentrate on single vaccines and separate them out more vigorously versus push them together.

And so our approach is to really -- we have an excellent asset here in Arexvy.

 

What we want to see is the full profile, as Tony mentioned, we want to see what this product looks like at 3 years because that is going to have a huge impact on pricing, durability, et cetera, which are all the things and particularly in European contracts that players concentrate on.

So we're happy to let people bid against themselves.

 

We want to sit and wait and see what the true picture of the product is and then build a business based on that.

And as I said before, the numbers are looking very good for Arexvy unless we have that, we will then move ahead and execute.

 



Nick Stone

So given that we're coming up to about [indiscernible], I'm going to take one more question, so apologies for the 4 of you that didn't get to ask a question, but we're going to go to Simon Baker at Redburn Atlantic.

 



Simon Baker

I should respect from limit up to one question.

 

It's on Arexvy, but it's one for Tony.

In terms of the potential mechanism for lower incidence of dementia.

 

I just wondered what thoughts you had on that.

There's been some suggestion that it's an indirect effect caused by the vaccine suppressing reactivation of HSV 1 virus.

 

But any thoughts you got on why we're seeing this effect would be much appreciated.



Tony Wood

Yes, Simon, I presume you mentioned Arexvy in that rather than Arexvy you know the story.

 

Look, it's fair to say there's very little known here mechanistically.

We're investing in further retrospective studies and mechanistic ones.

 

Let me just try and do this quickly.

There is some potential that the mechanism may be vascular in nature.

 

It may even be due to, as you say, underlying let's call it, subclinical reactivation.

It's the science is better level, although not by any means comprehensive for HSV underlying reactivation and therefore, inflammation that occurs as a result of that leading to dementia.

 

One can imagine a similar story in the context of shingles or one could even imagine that constant reactivation impacts microglial function.

So there are a range -- and I haven't been comprehensive in that answer to avoid on spending too much time on it.

 

It's fair to say there's a range of different mechanisms.

If you want to comprehensive summary actually, the Australian paper detailing the epidemiological retrospective outcomes has a really nice summary and it's completing paragraph.

 



A - Emma Walmsley

Thank you.

 

I mean it's exciting science to explore still in early stages.

In the meantime, this is a very effective vaccine with still a lot of opportunities to penetrate around the world.

 

.

So with that, Nick, as all asking, please thank you to everyone.

 

We are really pleased with our Q2 performance and another upgrade to our outlook and even more looking forward to the ongoing progress in our pipeline and delivering on our short, medium and long-term ambitions.

With thanks to everybody for joining us for the call.

 

We look forward to following up with you in coming days.","Operator

Good day and thank you for standing by.

Please be advised today’s conference is being recorded.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lavina Talukdar.

 

Please go ahead.



Lavina Talukdar

Thank you Kevin.

 

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on today’s call to discuss Moderna’s second quarter 2024 financial results and business update.

You can access the press release issued this morning, as well as the slides that we will be reviewing, by going to the Investors section of our website.

 

On today’s call are Stéphane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; Jamey Mock, our Chief Financial Officer, and Stephen Hoge, our President.

Before we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

 

Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.

I will now turn the call over to Stéphane.

 



Stéphane Bancel

Thank you Lavina.

 

Good morning or good afternoon everyone.

Thank you for joining us today.

 

I will start with a review our business, Jamey will present our financial results for the quarter and take you through our basic financial framework.

Stephen will then review our clinical progress.

 

I will then close by sharing our commercial progress and our outlook for major upcoming milestones.

In the second quarter of 2024, our respiratory franchise has shown remarkable progress and is poised to positively impact millions of lives globally each year.

 

This is why we started Moderna, to impact patients, and that is why the Moderna team is so focused on execution because of that profound impact on so many lives.

Our mRNA-1273 vaccine, Spikevax, continues to play a critical role in combating COVID.

 

Based on CDC data for the season just ending, October 23 to June 24, COVID continues to result in higher hospitalization than other respiratory viruses.

We are pleased that our RSV vaccine, whose brand name is mRESVIA, our second respiratory product, has launched in the U.S.

 

and has now shipped to U.S.

customers.

 

It is poised to impact public health in the U.S.

this year and soon in many other countries for many years to come.

 

Our flu vaccine candidate, mRNA-1010, has demonstrated positive Phase III results, meeting all immunogenicity end points in adults 18 and older.

Our flu + COVID combo vaccine candidate, mRNA-1083, has also shown positive results in Phase III, underscoring our ability to innovate and [indiscernible] respiratory illnesses effectively.

 

These achievements highlight the strength of our mRNA platform and our commitment to public health.

We have now five out of five vaccines with positive Phase III data: COVID, RSV, flu, next-gen COVID, mRNA-1083 and our cold + COVID combo.

 

We are very excited about these achievements and are very thankful for our teams.

We believe our technology has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of these respiratory illnesses globally and save millions of hospitalizations around the world and thus impacting millions of families.

 

Moving to business highlights for Q2, we manufactured the ’24 - ’25 season COVID vaccine targeting both the KP2 and GA1 strains of the virus.

We are ready to meet the demand for the ’24 - ’25 respiratory season.

 

In addition to RSV approval in the U.S, we are pleased that mRESVIA received a positive opinion from Europe’s regulatory agency, EMA CHMP.

We are waiting for regulatory approvals in additional countries around the world.

 

For pandemic flu, we recently announced a partnership in the U.S.

with BARDA to address H5 influenza virus and future public health threats.

 

The agreement awarded Moderna $176 million in funding to accelerate the development of mRNA-based pandemic flu vaccines.

Lastly, our Japanese partnership with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation is an important collaboration.

 

With this joint agreement, we will co-promote Moderna respiratory vaccines in Japan, extending our reach and impact in the Japanese market.

In Q2, our revenues were up $241 million, [indiscernible] reflect the highly seasonal nature of our respiratory vaccine business.

 

The net loss was $1.3 billion.

We ended the quarter with $10.8 billion [indiscernible] strong cash and investment position.

 

This progress [indiscernible] allows us to continue investing in our key programs and initiatives.

Additionally, we continue to make considerable progress in reducing our operating expenses.

 

Compared to Q2 2023, we have decreased our operating expenses by more than $600 million in Q2 2024.

This reduction highlights our commitment to operational efficiency and financial discipline.

 

Before I hand over to Jamey, I want to touch on the announcement we made last week.

We are very pleased and proud to welcome David Rubinstein, the co-founder and co-chairman of Carlyle Group to the Moderna board, starting next week.

 

David has decades of experience investing and growing businesses across a number of industries.

He is also one of the most respected voices globally on matters related to international affairs and public policy.

 

We are very excited to have him join us to help build Moderna to reach to the next level.

With David joining the board, Stephen Berenson is stepping down from the board, and I would like to personally thank him for his many contributions during his tenure, including through the pandemic.

 

We also announced that Bob Langer has informed the board of his intention to retire from the board.

As one of our co-founders, Bob has made incredible contributions to Moderna and we would not the company we are today without his vision and insights.

 

I am personally very grateful to Bob for his coaching and mentoring, especially during the early years of Moderna, where his [indiscernible] experience was so valuable to me.

With that, let me turn to Jamey.

 



Jamey Mock

Thanks Stéphane, and hello everyone.

 

Today I will walk you through our financial performance for the second quarter and also update you on our financial outlook for the remainder of 2024.

Let me start with our commercial performance on Slide 9.

 

Net product sales for Q2 were $184 million, down 37% year-over-year, mainly driven by lower sales volumes of our COVID-19 vaccine in regions outside of the United States compared to the second quarter of 2023, when we fulfilled orders from prior year contracts.

Q2 sales were above our guidance of approximately $100 million primarily due to stronger than expected sales in the United States.

 

We recognized sales from a number of other countries, including a small portion of the Brazil contract we announced last quarter.

Year-to-date sales were $351 million, down 83% year-over-year, largely driven by the same Q2 year-over-year trends I just mentioned a moment ago.

 

Moving to Slide 10, as I just explained, net product sales were $184 million.

In Q2, we recognized $30 million of licensing revenue which is included in the other revenue line of $57 million.

 

This revenue comes from a non-exclusive intellectual property out-licensing agreement with a leading pharmaceutical company in Japan announced in our Q1 earnings call.

The deal includes an upfront payment and low double-digit royalties on net sales of their COVID-19 product in Japan.

 

For the second quarter of 2024, our cost of sales was $115 million, which included $10 million of third party royalties, $55 million related to unutilized manufacturing capacity and wind down costs, and $14 million of inventory write-downs.

This resulted in our cost of sales representing 62% of net product sales.

 

As a result of our initiative to resize our manufacturing cost structure, cost of sales was down 84% from Q2 last year when cost of sales was 249%.

R&D expenses were $1.2 billion in Q2, reflecting a slight increase of $73 million or 6% year-over-year.

 

We purchased a priority review voucher during the second quarter which is included in our Q2 results.

With first half R&D spending at $2.3 billion, we are tracking towards a full year expected spend of approximately $4.5 billion.

 

SG&A expenses for Q2 were $268 million, reflecting a 19% decrease year-over-year.

This reduction is a result of our continued strong focus on cost discipline and strategic investments driving productivity, on which I will provide additional detail in the upcoming slide.

 

We reported zero income tax expense for the second quarter of 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of $369 million in the same period last year.

This shift is primarily due to the continued application of a valuation allowance on a majority of our deferred tax assets, which we first established in the third quarter of 2023.

 

Our net loss for the period was $1.3 billion, an improvement from the net loss of $1.4 billion recorded last year.

Loss per share was $3.33 compared to a loss of $3.62 in the second quarter of 2023.

 

We ended Q2 with cash and investments totaling $10.8 billion, down from $12.2 billion at the end of Q1, primarily due to ongoing research and development expenses and operating activities.

Moving to Slide 11 and similar to Q1, I want to provide additional detail on the cost reductions we are driving across the company.

 

You can see in our Q2 results that we had a 19% year-over-year reduction in SG&A spend due to efficiency gains.

One of the main drivers for the year-over-year reduction in SG&A is from our commercial and medical affairs group.

 

Over the past year, we have built our internal capabilities, which has allowed us to drive cost efficiencies by reducing our use of external consultants and other purchased services.

We’ve also been more focused and targeted on how we invest in these areas to drive the strongest possible return on investment.

 

As the endemic market has been more seasonal, we have shifted more of our commercial spend to the second half of the year.

Additionally, our procurement team has successfully driven company-wide cost reductions in the first half of 2024.

 

Their primary focus has been on reducing third party supplier rates, and we have seen strong progress in contract rates for raw materials, components, clinical, travel, and consulting services.

We continue to see strong adoption in artificial intelligence by our employees which will allow us to scale the business in an efficient manner with a digital-first mindset.

 

For example, in the second quarter our HR team launched benefits and equity GPTs.

These AI-driven assistants are designed to handle frequently asked questions previously directed to the HR operations team and allow us to scale efficiently.

 

Overall, we have built a solid foundation and made purposeful investments in people, processes and technology.

We’ve highlighted some of the significant drivers of the Q2 SG&A savings, but we are also seeing additional efficiency savings in R&D and manufacturing.

 

I’m very pleased with the cost savings results in the first half of the year and want to thank our Moderna teams.

Now let’s turn to our 2024 financial framework on Slide 12.

 

We are revising our expectation for 2024 net product sales to a range of $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion.

There are three primary drivers for the updated outlook.

 

First, we are now expecting very low sales in 2024 from EU member states based on recent feedback and discussions with country health officials.

Second, in the U.S.

 

we are seeing increased competitive pressures for our respiratory vaccines.

While this has led to a slower RSV ramp than previously anticipated, we continue to believe and mRESVIA’s long term potential.

 

Third, in the rest of the world we have provided for the potential risk of revenue deferrals from 2024 into 2025.

We remain committed in our attempt to mitigate these risks, but believe it’s appropriate to adjust our guidance at this time.

 

Finally, this revenue framework assumes a U.S.

COVID vaccination rate similar to last season.

 

Our second half sales mix will be dependent on timing of regulatory approvals across the world and the number of days available in the third quarter to ship.

We currently expect a remaining sales lift of 40% to 50% in Q3, with the balance in Q4.

 

We expect cost of sales as a percentage of product sales for the full year to be in the range of 40% to 50%, based upon our updated sales range.

For R&D, we continue to expect full year expenses to be approximately $4.5 billion, down from $4.8 billion in 2023.

 

For SG&A, we continue to expect full year expenses to be approximately $1.3 billion, down from $1.5 billion in 2023.

Note that we expect SG&A to be higher in the second half versus the first half, primarily due to increased commercial activity, but still expect the second half to be down on a year-over-year basis.

 

We continue to expect taxes to be negligible in 2024 and capital expenditures to be approximately $0.9 billion.

Finally, we continue to expect that we will end 2024 with approximately $9 billion in cash.

 

We have made strong progress in improving our working capital management, which is offsetting the change in our product sales outlook.

With that, I will now hand the call over to Stephen.

 



Stephen Hoge

Thank you Jamey.

 

Today I’ll review updates from our clinical programs in three of the four development areas in our portfolio.

In the second quarter, we had important updates in respiratory vaccines, oncology and rare diseases.

 

Starting with respiratory vaccines, we are very pleased by the approval and ATIP recommendation for our RSV vaccine, mRESVIA, in the U.S.

for all unvaccinated adults 75 years and older and in unvaccinated adults 60 to 74 years of age who are at increased risk from RSV.

 

This recommendation was the same as for the other two previously approved RSV vaccines.

We also recently received a positive CHMP opinion from the European Medicine Agency for mRESVIA, and as Stéphane mentioned earlier, we are working towards approvals in additional countries.

 

Turning to flu, we are in discussions with multiple regulatory authorities and intend to file in 2024.

For our next-generation COVID vaccine, mRNA-1283, we announced positive Phase III efficacy results demonstrating non-inferior efficacy against COVID-19 compared to Spikevax in all trial participants 12 years of age and older.

 

Efficacy was higher than Spikevax in adults 18 years and older.

We are excited by the data and are sharing the results with regulators and intend to file for approval beginning in 2024.

 

Rounding out the news in respiratory vaccines development, in the quarter we shared positive results from our Phase III trial with our combination flu and COVID vaccine.

The trial met its primary immunogenicity end points with the combination vaccine eliciting higher immune responses against flu and SARS-CoV-2 than the licensed flu and licensed COVID vaccines given separately in adults 50 years of age and older in the trial.

 

In the subset of participants 65 years of age and older, our combination vaccine also elicited higher immune responses than an enhanced flu vaccine that is recommended in the 65 and older age group in many countries, including the United States.

These results are exciting, and we have begun sharing them with regulators and planning for the next steps.

 

Turning now to oncology, in the quarter we share an update on our mRNA-4157 program, also known as INT, which elicits anti-tumor T-cell responses by targeting a patient’s unique tumor mutations, or neoantigens.

INT is in multiple large randomized trials, including two Phase III trials, one in adjuvant melanoma and the other in adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer; one Phase II/III trial in adjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and two randomized Phase II studies, one in adjuvant kidney cancer and the other in bladder cancer.

 

We and our partner, Merck expect to start additional studies in new tumor types.

The development program was launched on the back of impressive randomized Phase II trial results in adjuvant melanoma.

 

We recently shared the three-year follow-up data from that trial at ASCO this past June, and in the next few slides, I will quickly summarize the highlights from that presentation.

The primary clinical end point for the Phase II adjuvant melanoma study is recurrence-free survival, or RFS.

 

As presented at ASCO, there is a sustained improvement in RFS with the combination of INT plus Keytruda, versus Keytruda alone through three years of follow-up.

74.8% of patients receiving the combination treatment of INT plus Keytruda were alive and tumor-free at three years, which was 19 percentage points higher than Keytruda alone, and resulted in an impressive hazard ratio of 0.51.

 

The combination of INT plus Keytruda also showed sustained improvement in distant metastasis-free survival at three years.

89.3% of patients in combination INT plus Keytruda treatment group were alive and without metastases or distant spread of their tumor at three years of follow-up versus 68.7% of patients in the Keytruda monotherapy group.

 

This is an equally impressive and remarkable hazard ratio of 0.38.

Lastly, we were pleased to share data showing an early favorable trend in overall survival at three years of follow-up.

 

Finally on the safety side, INT continues to demonstrate a remarkable profile for a novel cancer therapy.

Immune-related adverse events were not higher in the combination INT plus Keytruda arm despite the benefits than in the Keytruda monotherapy arm.

 

This highlights the impressive emerging benefit-risk profile for our INT program.

Moving now to rare diseases, I’m happy to share that our MMA candidate, mRNA-3705, was selected for the FDA START program.

 

MMA is a rare disease in which patients cannot properly break down proteins from the food they digest; as a result, toxins build up in the bloodstream and cause recurrent episodes of life-threatening metabolic decompensation.

The FDA START program is a program designed to accelerate development of new and promising therapies in rare diseases where there is a high unmet need.

 

Our MMA candidate, mRNA-3705 is being evaluated in patients in a Phase I/II study with encouraging early results that we’ve previously shared, and we look forward to working with the FDA to accelerate the development of this promising potential medicine.

With that, I’ll now turn it back to Stéphane.

 



Stéphane Bancel

Thank you Stephen and Jamey.

 

Let’s start with COVID.

With the start of the COVID season only a few weeks away, contracting for the season is almost completed as we speak.

 

In the U.S., we have seen increased competitive pressure during the contracting season compared to last year, and we have not finalized most of the contracts.

We are working closely with public health officials, healthcare providers, pharmacies [indiscernible] with these stakeholders are critical in driving widespread vaccination adoption.

 

In the EU, we are in advanced discussions on the tender framework to provide market access; however, based on recent feedback from several large governments, we are now expecting very low sales to EU member states in 2024.

Some large countries will not buy Spikevax for the ’24 - ’25 season.

 

In the rest of the world, we have multiple signed contracts in place, some of which could be deferred into 2025.

Contracting discussions are ongoing with some additional countries, but we do not expect this will have a significant impact on our updated sales framework.

 

Moving now to launch preparation for the ’24 - ’25 season, our organization is fully prepared for the upcoming season thanks to the substantial efforts made by the Moderna teams to ensure the global availability of COVID vaccines.

In North America, we are ready to supply Spikevax targeting the KP2 strain, as asked by the FDA, demonstrating our ability to quickly pivot and manufacture Spikevax for selected strains.

 

In the rest of the world, we are supplying vaccine targeting the GA1 strain as requested by health authorities in those regions.

Let me now take you through details on the U.S.

 

COVID market.

We’ll be ready to supply millions of Spikevax doses to all segments of the U.S.

 

market upon regulatory approval.

Our goal is to ensure that Spikevax is available to all customers - large retail pharmacies, independent pharmacies, healthcare professionals, [indiscernible] hospital network and public health entities at the same time, facilitating early and widespread vaccination.

 

[Indiscernible] the world healthcare system to be ready to vaccinate is a key priority for us this season.

To this end, we have implemented a real-time order tracking system which is available to all of our customers and provides detailed information on every order, including [indiscernible] timing, package size, and temperature status.

 

Our supply chain is using AI tools to estimate the optimal order of distribution to locations within the U.S.

market.

 

These preparations highlight our commitment to ensuring the broad availability of Spikevax and meeting market demand.

Let me now turn to our marketing efforts.

 

We believe education and awareness campaigns will be important drivers to increase vaccination rates.

We have started these efforts early.

 

Ahead of the season, we have launched a back-to-basics campaign.

This initiative is designed to raise awareness about how the SARS-CoV-2 virus works and why it is critical to get a new booster each year, like for flu.

 

The virus mutates over time and we need to have a new tool to teach your immune system the new mutation to reduce infection, reduce hospitalization, and reduce deaths.

Additionally, we are working with public health authorities to educate the public on the impact of long COVID, highlighting how vaccines can help reduce risk for young and middle age adults.

 

Soon, we will start our in-season outreach to high risk groups.

By collaborating with major retail pharmacies, we aim to effectively market our products during the season.

 

This targeted approach ensures that our efforts are focused on those who are the most vulnerable, maximizing the benefits of vaccination for those groups.

By leveraging media channels, we aim to reach a broader audience and emphasize the critical need for vaccination to mitigate [indiscernible] outcomes.

 

Let me now turn to our RSV launch.

We are very excited about the launch of our second product, mRESVIA.

 

Following approval, [indiscernible] vaccine recommendation on par with competitor vaccines.

Specifically, ACIP [indiscernible] recommended a single dose of RSV vaccine for all unvaccinated adults age 75 and above.

 

ACIP also recommended a single dose for unvaccinated adults between the age of 60 and 74 who are at increased risk.

Based on these recommendations, approximately 40 million people in the U.S.

 

are eligible for vaccination.

The RSV market size beyond the ’24 - ’25 season will depend on re-vaccination recommendations which are anticipated to be discussed by ACIP in future meetings.

 

In RSV, our focus is to direct our efforts to the segments where the vast majority of vaccinations occur.

In the U.S., we’re targeting the pharmacy segment, which includes both large retail chains as well as independent pharmacies.

 

Together, the total pharmacy segment accounted last year for around 95% of RSV vaccine administration.

We began shipping product in pharmacy in July, and as Jamey mentioned earlier, we are seeing a highly competitive environment.

 

Additionally, larger competitor contracts will negotiate prior to approval and launch, resulting in lower 2024 share than we would have liked.

Long term, we continue to believe our [indiscernible] will resonate well with customers, offering them the ability to use their time, maximize efficiency during the busy fall vaccination season, and also reduce potential medical errors.

 

We look forward to some major upcoming milestones in the near term.

In respiratory vaccine, we expect a COVID approval and will be ready to ship in the U.S.

 

and rest of the world in the August-September time frame.

In RSV, we expect to release Phase III data for high risk individuals 18 years of age and above.

 

We are in discussions with regulators also on our flu program and intend to file in 2024.

We also expect to present immunogenicity data in older adults for our flu vaccine, Fluzone HD.

 

For our next-gen COVID vaccine, mRNA-1283, we are engaging with regulators and intend to file in 2024.

In our combination flu -COVID vaccine, mRNA-1083, we are engaging regulators and hope to be able to give an update soon.

 

[Indiscernible] fully enrolled and [indiscernible] we look forward to potentially Phase III vaccine efficacy readout in 2024.

As Stephen just talked about, we are very excited about the INT program and we are looking forward to the completion of enrollment of our Phase III in adjuvant melanoma, which is of course a major milestone.

 

We are keen to discuss with regulators the possibility of accelerated approval based on the Phase II study data.

As we shared before, they are treating the review as necessary before we could consider pursuing accelerated approval for INT: first, durability of data which we believe that as Stephen presented, we are there; second, a substantially enrolled Phase III adjuvant melanoma study, and third, manufacturing readiness at our Marlborough site.

 

Lastly, in our rare disease portfolio, we look forward to initiating a pivotal study for [indiscernible].

We are eager to achieve these milestones and to continue to progress towards our mission to deliver the greatest possible impact to people [indiscernible].

 

We expect these near term events combined with further advancement in our pipeline will confirm the power of our platform and its potential to serve patients for years to come.

An important save the date for your calendar, our annual R&D day will be the morning of September 12 in New York City.

 

Of course, a webcast will also be available.

Thank you for listening to the call, and we would like now with the team to take your questions.

 

Operator?
Operator

Thank you.

 

[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.

Your line is open.

 



Salveen Richter

Good morning.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

A couple from me here.

 

Can you help us understand the factors contributing to maintenance of the year-end cash balance guidance following the lowered product revenue guidance range?

Then with regard to competitive pressures noted regarding contracts for COVID into second half, can you be more specific on the factors here, whether it’s contracting logistics or the clinical profile competitive dynamics, or what that might be?

 

Third, how much visibility do you have on second half demand for the RSV vaccine based on contracting to date?

Thank you.

 



Jamey Mock

Hi Salveen, I’ll take the first question regarding the year-end cash balance.

 

I would say there’s a few factors in there.

Number one, on the deferrals of revenue, some of which we have already collected the cash and ultimately we will collect the remaining balance that might push into 2025, but some of that is already a prepayment.

 

Number two, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have been working on working capital.

We’ve got a whole team focused on it, and the teams are doing a great job from accounts payable, inventory balances, receivables and our collections progress.

 

You can see our receivables balance on the balance sheet is relatively small at this point, so the team’s done a great job, which helps offset it.

Then third, just coming into the year, we had a little bit of cushion to the $9 billion, so overall we remain confident in the $9 billion and are pleased with that kind of ending balance heading into 2025.

 



Stéphane Bancel

And Salveen, I’ll take the two or the question--it’s Stéphane.

 

On the competitive pressure, I think on both products, COVID and RSV, we are seeing similar things, which is [indiscernible] from larger competitors with a portfolio of products, an ability, if you want, to also be much more aggressive on activities, whether it’s supply chain, whether it’s pricing, whether it’s co-marketing funding and dollars activity, so it’s really a mix at the customer level.

We’ve just seen much more intensity and pressure on COVID versus last year, and on RSV, as you know, we’re entering a market where there’s two large established players, one with very large market share where of course [indiscernible], the other one who, as indicated, they want to gain market share because they are not pleased with their market share last year, and so we have been working really actively on that.

 

In terms of visibility for RSV, we have some contracts that have already been signed and that we are actively supplying customers now that the product has shipped.

We have some contracts that are being finalized with ability in season to demonstrate to the customer the value of PFS and to be able to move that into season, so we are working through all of those things.

 

We’ll provide updates as the season goes, but we know this is very important for patients, it’s very important for the company, so we’re all hands on deck on COVID and RSV.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.

Your line is open.

 



Terence Flynn

Great, thanks for taking the questions.

 

Maybe two for me as well.

Was just wondering on the guidance cut, if you can quantify how much was from COVID versus RSV, and then on the seasonal flu and the seasonal flu plus COVID combo, I might be parsing words here, but on seasonal flu, I notice the press release said intend to file in 2024, the combo said engaging with regulators on next steps, so maybe you could just help us think through the gating factors for each of those and the difference in language there.

 

Thank you.



Jamey Mock

Yes, thanks Terence.

 

I’ll take the first one related to guidance and what’s the split between COVID and RSV.

What I would say is if you look at the three drivers, all of them are, first, similar in size.

 

Then if I break them down, the deferrals are all related to COVID, the EU is all related to COVID, and then that last category of competitiveness in RSV vaccine--or in respiratory vaccines, there’s a split between COVID and RSV, so that should give you some understanding of the general split between COVID and RSV.



Stephen Hoge

Great, and for the question on the language, good pick-up.

 

The 1083 flu COVID program is the most recent Phase III results, really quite fresh, and we have just begun the process of engaging with regulators, meaning sharing that data and discussing with them what their expectations would be on submission.

For the other programs that you referenced, obviously we’ve had more time, had some of those discussions, and we’re obviously preparing for submissions, as we said in our prepared remarks.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies.

Your line is open.

 



Michael Yee

Thank you guys.

 

Two questions from us.

Looking forward on guidance, you obviously have revenue guidance this year, you have opex guidance which we see is around $6 billion of R&D and SG&A, and as you project out to the following years, you have already given cash flow guidance, so if things are generally staying along the same trajectory, I would think that cash guidance would be lower.

 

Can you speak to the math there, and perhaps Jamey, who has said you could flex opex, is that of heightened importance and heighted priority more aggressively as you think about where things stand today in the change of guidance and talk to that, given cash guidance is a big concern for investors?

The second question is going back to RSV - I appreciate the comments you just said, that was super helpful in breaking it down.

 

Is that to say that the RSV projections you have are going to be perhaps in half, and is that due to lower share and lower price, and speak to that?

Thank you.

 



Jamey Mock

Yes, thanks Mike.

 

We are still--as I mentioned, we’re still expecting $9 billion in cash next year and don’t currently have any different change in our outlook for the $6 billion to $7 billion that we said we’d end 2025 with, and let me break that down.

First, this year we went from the start of the year, $13 billion to $9 billion, so a $4 billion loss in cash.

 

That included many prepayments coming into the year that will no longer repeat, so we’re not actually getting the cash from operations and that won’t be a drag year-over-year.

Second, we plan to return to growth in 2025 and, as I mentioned earlier, some of that will also be buoyed by the fact that we have some deferrals heading into 2025, but more so we’ll have an entire year and operating experience on RSV, we hope to bring new products to market, and so we’re still expecting to return to growth.

 

But yes, I mean, we continue to look at opex and understand what we want to do there, and we are always laser focused on our cash balance, and at this time we don’t think the $6 billion to $7 billion will change.



Michael Yee

Okay, and then on RSV, breaking it down, just a little more specifics on the impact of market share contracting and price, and how to think about that?

 



Jamey Mock

Yes, it’s a bit of both.

 

We’re not breaking it down, nor have we given guidance on RSV, but I would say this year is not turning out as we expected, and I answered Terence’s questions in terms of how much is really split between COVID and RSV, so you can kind of get an understanding there.

But again, we were third to market this year, some of the contracts were already negotiated, we only are participating in the second half, but I think our hope is that we get access across many of the retail chains, they start to get comfortable with us with the second product so that when we head into 2025, we can get a more fair market share on RSV.

 



Michael Yee

Perfect, thank you.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from Eliana Merle with UBS.

 

Your line is open.



Elliott Bosco 

Hi, this is Elliott Bosco from UBS on for Eli Merle.

 

Two from us.

Can you elaborate on the latest timing you expect for the Phase III CMV study, based on how event rates are tracking, and based on just the necessary 12 months of median safety follow-up, from a purely protocol perspective, what is the earliest we could potentially get the interim?

 

Then second on international COVID revenues in future years, what do you see as the likelihood of potential deferral again in 2025?



Stephen Hoge

Great, thanks for the questions.

 

I’ll take it first.

First, we have enough data on case numbers for CMV.

 

We may have an update at R&D day - I’m not sure, but we don’t have any change to our prior guidance, which is we do think that the interim analysis of efficacy could happen this year, and that would account for also median safety follow-up from a timing perspective, and so at this point, no new update, but we continue to stand behind the belief that the interim analysis for efficacy on the CMV program could happen this year.



Jamey Mock

Yes, and Elliott, on the deferrals, could they happen in 2025, the answer is yes, they can always happen.

 

That said, some of this will push into next year, so, and if some of those push into the following year, those two would offset, but we’re not expecting that at that point.

The only thing I’d say is we will come to market with our resilience contracts in the U.K., Australia and Canada, that provides us additional growth in those areas as well as potentially participating in additional public tenders as well, so there’s a little bit of risk but I think we can mitigate it with the deferrals from this year, as well as additional resilience contracts.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Gena Wang with Barclays.

Your line is open.

 



Gena Wang

Thank you.

 

I just have one question regarding the guidance for this year, particularly regarding the COVID revenue in the U.S.

It seems contracting is mostly down, and you already also expect similar vaccination rates versus last year, and we know there is mainly only two players, so what could lead to the lower COVID revenue this year from prior [indiscernible] guidance?

 



Stephen Hoge

Yes, thanks Gena.

 

We define competitiveness both in terms of share and in price, so we’re relatively pleased with our market share, there’s potentially some price pressure in there.

But generally speaking, we think that the U.S.

 

will perform pretty well compared to last year, but we are seeing a bit of a competitive--a more competitive market this year after a year where in the U.S., we had nearly or approximately 50% market share, so.

We’re seeing the pressure but still confident in the overall performance of the U.S.

 

business.



Gena Wang

Thank you.

 
Operator

Our next question comes from Luca Issi with RBC Capital.

 

Your line is open.



Luca Issi

Oh, great.

 

Thanks so much for taking my questions.

Maybe Stephen, quick question - the recent ACIP meeting, it feels to me that the debate before that ACIP meeting was whether RSV was going to be either an annual vaccine or an every other year vaccine.

 

However, ACIP clearly chose neither of them and simply said, this is one and done, so two questions.

Were you surprised by that decision, and two, how should we think about the market potential for RSV long term, in light of the fact this is maybe a one and done vaccine versus obviously COVID and flu are annual vaccines?

 

Any color there would be much appreciated, and then maybe quickly walk us through what’s the latest thinking on the opportunity for bird flu.

Thanks so much.

 



Stephen Hoge

Great, thank you for both questions.

 

Obviously first and foremost, our focus at the ACIP meeting was we were quite pleased with the parity recommendation, and I think we were all pleased with the clear recommendation for those over the age of 75 and those with higher risk from RSV, that they really should get vaccinated.

As its only a year old is the market, the most important thing we can do is cover the large number of people who are now recommended, the 40 million-plus who are not vaccinated, and that’s quite a large increase in the number of folks who we hope to cover soon.

 

Now, on the question--the specific question of revaccination, I think it’s also important to say that we are--you know, the ACIP is really just looking at one year of real-world data, and all three of the vaccines, but including mRESVIA, show significant second season protection, although it does decrease, and so there is the decline from season one into season two from a clinical trial perspective, but there’s still protection there in that year two.

While you’re only one year into that public experience, public health experience, I think ACIP took a prudent choice and said there’s still a benefit, and maybe the focus should be on increasing vaccination coverage rates for those who are current unprotected because there clearly is some benefit, even still at that second year.

 

I think if you fast forward a year, and this would be my perception, but if you fast forward a year, if you look at the rates of waning for the other two vaccines than ours, there is clearly a decline from year one to two, and from year two to three.

The pace of that decline suggests that by year three, there really won’t be much protection for those people who have received vaccines in the first year.

 

I think that’s when you probably need to start asking the question of, do we continue to leave those people unprotected or boost them again?

Now, from a scientific perspective, you asked my view, you will be infected with RSV almost 20 times in your life, you will repeatedly get ill.

 

In fact, many people who are at risk of severe complications over the age of 75 or otherwise with medical co-morbidities, they’ve seen RSV before.

It’s the waning protection from that infection that ultimately is the reason why you need a vaccine, and because you get infected multiple times by that virus over life, even if you’ve seen it before, you probably will benefit from a booster in future.

 

We continue to believe that as the public health story evolves, that recommending bodies and CDC and ACIP will look at the waning efficacy, the potential to boost people again and hopefully provide additional public benefit, and that eventually there will be recommendations for revaccination for those who are at highest risk of RSV, but it is not our choice.

We are providing that data to obviously the regulators but principally to groups like CDC, and then they will determine the right moment, if ever, to recommend that revaccination in the United States.

 

As it relates to bird flu, we continue to follow that very closely.

It’s drifted a little bit out of the news more recently - I think that’s a good thing, but the most important news for us has been in the quarter, we executed an agreement with BARDA to advance into Phase III with our pandemic bird flu vaccine, which we’ll provide updates on as we move forward in the months and the year ahead.

 

But we will be sure to be partnering with public health entities across the world, including the United States government specifically.

We’re grateful for working with BARDA again in the event that bird flu does emerge as a pandemic or epidemic threatening this country.

Your line is open.



Alexandria Hammond

Hi, thanks for taking my question.

 

Ahead of results for VX-522 in collaboration with Vertex for CF, if results provide positive proof of concept for the ability of mRNA and liquid nanoparticles to be aerosolized and cross the mucus barrier in the lung, can you walk us through additional indications you may be interested in, and should we expect you to develop these indications in partnership with Vertex?

Thank you.

 



Stephen Hoge

Thanks for the question.

 

We have--as you highlight, there is a large number of pulmonary diseases for which respiratory delivery could be quite impactful.

We have not provided any updates on the preclinical programs that we’ve moved into development, and so I would describe those activities right now as still research and discovery phase, and not something for competitive reasons and for scientific reasons that we’ll talk about.

 

They’re in the earlier stages.

As it relates to whether we would partner with Vertex on it, we would of course always welcome partnering with Vertex given their expertise, but the partnership we have right now, the deal we have with them is limited to the cystic fibrosis program at this point.

Our next question comes from Edward Tenthoff with Piper Sandler.

Your line is open.

 



Edward Tenthoff

Great, thank you.

 

Most of my questions have been answered, but I appreciate all the detail.

I wanted to ask a little bit about the orphan disease program, and maybe you can provide a little bit of color on what the regulatory path might look like in MMA and PA.

 

Thank you.



Stephen Hoge

Thanks Ted.

 

They are somewhat different, and they are in early stages of those regulatory conversations, so.

We just received the FDA START designation, but if you look at the data that we shared last R&D day, and we’ll obviously provide updates on this going forward, one of the clearer pictures that emerged was that in MMA, we are seeing good movement of a biomarker of methylmalonic acid that’s pathognomonic for the disease, and so you can imagine of the challenges very quickly when you have a good biomarker is how do you validate that biomarker and show that moving that biomarker is reasonably likely to predict benefit, and that’s a scientific question we will work on and ultimately engage with regulators, including FDA, as a key step for moving forward.

 

We are evaluating in the clinical trial folks movement in their biomarker from baseline, so it’s a clear study to run.

In the case of proprionic acidemia, there is not as clear a biomarker in the field because of the structure of that particular part of the metabolic pathway, and so there we’ve been following events, and as you know, we’ve previously shared in a single-arm study the pre and post treatment rates of metabolic decompensations.

 

We have seen a favorable trend in that - we’re actually quite excited by that.

That takes a little more time than a biomarker, but we obviously have been working on that a little bit longer, and so we’ll be engaging with regulators on that single arm approach and understanding the difference between internal controls or other controls to evaluate that.

 

In any event, you may end up with a randomized study, you may be able to use a single arm study, and in the case of MMA, you may be able to use a biomarker, so those are the kinds of conversations we’re having, but as I said, they’re early days.

The FDA discussion on MMA just started, and so we’ll provide updates as we have more clarity on those timelines.

 



Edward Tenthoff

Our next question comes from Jessica Fye with JP Morgan.

 

Your line is open.



Jessica Fye

Hey guys, good morning.

 

Thanks for taking my questions.

For RSV, I’m curious your take on Pfizer’s comment that customers want to carry an RSV vaccine that could address both maternal and the older adult population.

 

Then for INT, I saw it on the near term milestone slide, but to clarify, what’s your latest projection on when you expect to complete enrolment of the Phase III adjuvant melanoma trial, and what’s the latest you can share on manufacturing progress for that product?

Are there any updates to share on how that’s going?

 

Thank you.



Stephen Hoge

Sure, I’ll take that.

 

Obviously the majority of the recommended population in this country continues to be the older adults.

I wouldn’t comment on Pfizer’s competitive positioning on our quarterly call except to say that in the retail channel overwhelmingly and in many physicians’ offices overwhelmingly, the focus is on protecting older Americans.

 

What’s happening with the younger population, maternal population is obviously smaller in terms of an overall market opportunity.

We do recognize the need to try and provide the broadest potential label and, as we’ve previously updated, we are pleased that we’ve conducted our Phase III study in 18 to 59-year-old high risk populations, and we intend to file that this year with a goal of expanding that label for those who are at high risk for medical reasons and may benefit from an RSV vaccine, even if they are younger.

 

I would say we agree that a broad label is valuable, but I think it’s important to cover as many people as possible, and that’s what we’re excited by moving forward with our 18 to 59-year-old filing.

On the question of INT, we have not with our partner updated yet on where we are in enrolment.

 

Obviously as we had said at ASCO, and there was quite some coverage of risk, we are pleased, very pleased with the pace of enrolment, and we do expect that to conclude quickly, but we have not yet provided any updates and we’ll obviously do so at the appropriate time with our partner, Merck.

As it relates to manufacturing, we actually have made great progress there establishing our Marlborough facility, as well as demonstrating through the clinical trial our ability to manufacture at high volume, frankly commercially relevant volumes, and so we’re--we feel like we’re in a good place in terms of the manufacturing trajectory.

 

It’s still a few months of work to go this year to get to where we want to be, but we’re starting to feel quite optimistic that the manufacturing will be online as and when we hope.

Our next question comes from Evan Wang with Guggenheim Securities.

 

Your line is open.



Evan Wang

Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions.

 

A few from me.

Just first, just given the comments on the higher competitive environment, how are you thinking longer term about the outlook for RSV and COVID versus some of the [indiscernible] you made earlier in the year and historically, just given some of the pricing and market share dynamics there?

 

Second, with COVID and the EU tender, what’s your level of confidence in the EU being a meaningful contributor in 2025, and what changes between now and then?

You know, does having the combo or potentially having a combo add to competitiveness there?

 

Lastly, I saw that you guys purchased a PRV - is that for use on the combo or the standalone flu, and are you comfortable in getting ahead of the potential June recommendation next year?

Thanks.

 



Stéphane Bancel

Thanks, this is Stéphane.

 

On the high competitive environment on COVID and RSV, what we believe is on RSV, our customers are going to experience the PFS product, and that’s going to be ability to really have full season, to be able to try and get the products to a channel that will have lots, so we anticipate in ’25 to have better share than in ’24 for the U.S.

We’re going to be launching probably outside U.S.

 

markets in ’25, that’s of course we’ll not have sales in ’24, so that’s all going to be important for growth.

In COVID, we believe the portfolio in terms of next-gen COVID and then flu plus COVID, it’s going to be an important driver to kind of reset the expectation moving forward and the market dynamics.

 

In terms of the EU, the current contract between Pfizer and the EU ends in 2026, so we think 2025 and 2026 are still going to be low.

Some countries have actually used a lot of our vaccine and so we could see some countries in ’25 and more in ’26 needing COVID vaccine and then wanting to diversify their supply base [indiscernible] vaccine as well, given its performance, so as you mentioned the combo, it’s something that we have been discussing quite a lot with governments in Europe.

 

They see the value of a combo given its strong performance, as we’ve shared, to be an important tool for public health in terms of compliance.

In a world where governments are worried about people getting their flu shot and their COVID shot and their RSV shot, that’s just a lot of shots and nobody likes needles, nobody likes to go to the doctor or to the pharmacist, and so the combo is something that customers are really valuing, so that could be another opportunity in countries when this product is available to go back into growing Europe.

 

The key priority for us in Europe now for 2025 is really launching RSV and growing the business on RSV until we see the flu mono or flu plus COVID launch.

Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with TD Securities.

Your line is open.

 



Greg

Hi there, this is Greg [indiscernible] from TD Securities.

 

I am more interested in your thoughts on the magnitude of the RSV market.

[Indiscernible] small in relation to last year during earnings, so do you agree, and what is your latest thinking on the overall sizes of the RSV market in elderly patients versus the prior that you built you’re your expectations?

 



Lavina Talukdar

You broke up a little bit during your question.

 

I think we caught the tail end of your question, which is what is the size of the RSV market relative to what we though previously?



Greg

Yes, thank you.

 

Just to reiterate quickly, I believe that GSK discussed the RSV market being smaller this year relative to last year [indiscernible].

Just didn’t know if you agree with that and what was your latest thinking on the overall size versus the prior $6 billion to $8 billion [indiscernible].

 



Stéphane Bancel

Yes, so let me try to take a stab at it.

 

As Stephen stated, in the long term we believe that as real-world evidence data is gathered by public health leaders, that they will most probably be in for boosting.

The current recommendation is what it is, but as Stephen said, we believe it will potentially evolve over time.

 

For this year, I think what is interesting is on paper, it seems that it could be a smaller market.

The thing that’s going to be interesting to see how it plays out in terms of market size and number of doses in arms is the guidelines are much more clear than last year, and as you know, sometimes in vaccinations, you get a better reaction from the doctors and pharmacists and consumers with clear guidelines versus not as clear guidelines with larger population potential.

 

Because of those two factors, it’s going to be interesting to see how the season plays out.



Greg

Thank you.

 



Stephen Hoge

Then I would just comment on the current year market size as well.

 

I think we talked about what we believe the patient population is, which is still sizeable, and we believe that the market will still be overall sizeable this year and similar to last year, if not a little bit more.

I think there are other factors at play with those comments - you know, there was a lot of inventory that was--or a lot of sales that happened in the prior year, that customers may be sitting on some of that inventory, so from a revenue perspective that might be different, but from a vaccination rate perspective, we believe that it will still be similar, if not a little bit bigger this year.

Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with Evercore.

 

Your line is open.



Adi 

Hi, good morning.

 

This is Adi on for Cory.

I have a question on has the recent summer COVID surge caused any concern for fall vaccinations as the infected population is usually recommended not to get vaccinated for six months post infection, and is the base case for the U.S.

 

COVID revenue similar vaccination as last year, which I think per CDC tracking was 22.5 overall population and 14% for 65 and above?



Stephen Hoge

Yes, I’ll take it.

 

First, the question on the summer wave and the epidemiology, we’ve seen this multiple years in a row now, and so in some ways, there is a move in certain geographies towards a little bit of a summer wave.

It just highlights the fact that this virus is incredibly effectively at spreading, incredibly effective in creating disease even for folks many years after vaccination and other protection, and why we need to protect people for the winter season, because whatever we see in the summer, you see a dramatically higher wave in the November through February time horizon, and so that’s really where we’re trying to protect people for.

 

But in terms of does the summer wave impact, the small summer wave impact the view of the fall wave, it really doesn’t change year-over-year that perspective, and that’s why we’re confident vaccination coverage rates will still be there, and as Jamey said, we see them the same.

We hope to do better, but we see them minimally as similar to last year in the United States.

Good day, everyone.

 

My name is Gary, and I will be your conference operator today.

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

 

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations.

 



Lynn Antipas Tyson

Thank you, Gary.

 

Welcome to Ford Motor Company's second quarter 2024 earnings call.

With me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO; and John Lawler, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer.

 

Also joining us for Q&A is Cathy O'Callaghan, CEO of Ford Credit.

Today's discussion includes some non-GAAP references.

 

These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S.

GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, and you can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com.

 

Our discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations.

Actual results may differ from those stated.

 

The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on page 20.

Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year.

 

Company EBIT, EPS, and free cash flow on an adjusted basis.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim.

 



Jim Farley

Thanks, Lynn.

 

And thanks for joining us.

First, I wanted to thank our global team.

 

Remaking Ford into a high-margin, high-growth, more capital-efficient and a more durable business is really hard work.

It requires focus, collaboration and excellence.

 

And I also want to thank our investors.

We're committed to creating value consistently over the long-term, and we appreciate your support and input.

 

Execution against our Ford+ plan allows us to break free from the low-margin, capital-intensive and cyclical attributes that have constrained auto -- legacy auto valuations for a long time.

And this process does not happen in a straight line.

 

We are absolutely a different company than we were three years ago.

And our pace of change is intensifying.

 

The creation of Ford Pro, Blue, and Model e have been a huge catalyst for transparency, accountability and more rigorous capital allocation.

Our Ford Pro business is amazing.

 

It's a high-margin business tracking towards $70 billion in revenue this year with further opportunities for profitable growth outside of vehicle sales, parts and service and software.

And a good example of that is a recent decision by our team to add 100,000 units of capacity of Super Duty in Canada.

 

It not only serves our customers, but it's capital-efficient and has very high returns for many years to come.

As you know, we flipped our international operations many years ago from deep losses to now profits and positive cash flow with more opportunities ahead, and that includes China.

 

We also took our product portfolio from too many generic vehicles and infused it with passion and purpose.

We build out our iconic F-Series and Transit lines, as well as passion vehicles like Mustang and the new Bronco lineup, and sub-brands like Raptor and Tremor and Dark Horse.

 

Few OEMs can offer a customer choice like Ford at our scale.

Ford is number one in our home market for internal combustion.

 

We're number two in EVs and have been for 2.5 years.

And we are the number three hybrid brand in the U.S.

 

But what's less visible, but incredibly important for investors is the foundational work underway in the company to move to software-defined vehicles and breakthrough digital experiences.

And I'll talk about that later, but this will have significant operating leverage.

 

Ford+ is on track.

Today we reaffirmed our adjusted EBIT guidance for the whole year and raised our outlook for adjusted free cash flow.

 

I'm going to comment on our EV landscape and strategy, software technology and services that are growing importance at Ford, our Ford Pro business and quality.

On electrification, we've been very vocal about why electric vehicles are so important and a great choice for customers and businesses.

 

Customers' usage data and cost of ownership data would indicate about 50% of customers who buy automobiles would be better served on buying an electric vehicle.

Now there's a lot of misconceptions around EVs on the separate areas of costs like resale value and insurance, of course range and charging and battery life, and OEMs like Ford must do a much better job in educating our customers about the advantages that EV offers in terms of cost of ownership.

 

As you know, we are the number two EV brand in the U.S.

for over 2.5 years.

 

That's a long time, and we've learned a lot and now we have used those learnings to sharpen our strategy.

What we learned is that it's incredibly important to be transparent about Model e losses.

 

Inside the company as well forces this forced accountability, and the result is our team is getting much more strappy and resourceful in terms of turning the business around.

We are now more disciplined and have to be for capital and expense.

 

And this means we will not launch vehicles at a loss that are not good for our business knowing what we know now about the reality of the market equation.

And we clearly see China and Tesla as the cost benchmark.

 

We also see excess capacity that will lead to more pricing pressures, which is in our business plan, more consolidation and many, many more partnerships.

We see less vertical integration in some areas to relieve capital, and we see a lot of tough choices on footprint.

 

Early majority customers are really different than the early adopters, particularly in retail.

And we see a lot more openness to hybrids and extended-range electric vehicles we call E-REVs.

 

We also see a divergence on electrification adoption between commercial and retail.

Commercial customers focus on total cost of ownership.

 

They use the vehicles much more intensely and they do not overbuy batteries that retail customers do.

They're also investing in our Pro charging depots and our integrated software because they want to be smart about the cost of charging their vehicles.

 

And I'm happy to say that our EV Pro contribution margin for our EV vans is now already positive.

We also have learned a lot about the size of the vehicle.

 

We believe smaller, more affordable vehicles are the way to go for EV in volume.

Why?

 

Because the math is completely different than ICE.

In ICE, the business we've been in for 120 years, the bigger the vehicle, the higher the margin.

 

But it's exactly the opposite for EVs; the larger the vehicle, the bigger the battery, the more pressure on margin because customers will not pay a premium for those larger batteries.

And lastly, compliance.

 

There is a lot of pressure on compliance.

And the lower demand for EVs, especially the pricing, means that CO2 credits are now likely going to be needed for fleet flexibility and optionality and will be a critical strategy choice for any company.

 

What are the success criteria's for EVs in the future?

Well, the first one is to have the right mix of fully and partially electric solutions.

 

This is imperative.

You have to have a compelling product roadmap and you have to have very flexible manufacturing.

 

A good example is our hybrid business.

The global hybrid portfolio at Ford is on track to grow 40% this year across nine nameplates.

 

And we really bet on hybrid trucks.

In the first half of the year, our hybrid pickups, Maverick and F-150, grew more than three times the rate of the overall hybrid segment.

 

Our F-150 hybrid with Pro Power onboard is a game-changer for our customers.

Commercial customers have power on the run like job sites, and our retail customers have emergency power backup.

 

And boy, have we seen that in Texas and all the other extreme weather events, how important that is for our customers.

The second success factor is matching the cost of the Chinese OEMs and Tesla, especially on affordable EVs.

 

Now when people hear about affordability and they think about small and unaffordable, I'd like to address that now.

We are designing a super-efficient platform, leveraging innovation across our product development, supply chain and manufacturing teams.

 

With no engine or drivetrain, a smaller vehicle can have a much roomier package, actually the interior package of a class above, with a small silhouette.

That's a big advantage for customers versus ICE.

 

And we're focusing on very differentiated vehicles priced under $40,000 or even $30,000.

And we're going to focus on two segments: work and adventure.

 

And why does this matter?

Well, the use case for smaller vehicles, affordable vehicles means shorter trips, more urban locations.

 

It fits the duty cycle of an EV.

And affordability, well, smaller batteries have an outsized impact on the cost and margin of the vehicle.

 

And the consumer tax credit in the U.S.

become a much larger part of the sticker price of the vehicle and that is supercharging the lower cost of ownership that EVs have already without it.

 

And finally, we have the ability to leverage this platform across many top hats, which will drive scale and large installed base for our growing software business.

And the last success criteria is to be really careful about your larger EVs.

 

For us, they'll be part of the picture, but success requires even more breakthrough on a cost efficiency, much smarter choices on segments, in our case, work and commercial, a lot of partnerships and a lot of technology pathways.

Overall, the EV journey has been humbling, but it has forced us to get even more fit as a company, including applying it to our ICE business, and that will pay off long run -- in the long run.

 

I am so happy we scaled 2.5 years ago, and we have the option to incorporate those learnings into our next generation of EVs launching in the coming years.

I want to double-click on the software technology and services business.

 

Ford, alongside Rivian and Tesla, are really the only non-Chinese OEMs controlling software across all the vehicle domain.

Most companies are doing OTAs on vehicle entertainment.

 

Ford now has multi-year experience on updating powertrains, braking, the fundamental performance of the vehicle and connectivity.

And the breadth of our portfolio, including F-150 and our Pro business, the customer use case is clearly much more complicated than Rivian and Tesla.

 

Our vehicles are increasingly general-purpose computers capable of delivering the type of application environment, AI for our customers and user experiences that we expect from all of our digital devices.

And this allows us to create powerful, connected, ever-improving customized experiences, which I'll talk about.

 

Many of you may be surprised that Ford leads on OTAs.

According to the 2024 OEM OTA capability rankings in North America, we are the leader based on quality of our updates.

 

This is not how many updates we do, although we do a lot.

It's about the ability to improve the fundamental performance and capability of the entire vehicle and all the modules in the vehicle.

 

And there's no better evidence than Mach-E.

Longer range, better efficiency on the battery, faster zero to 60 times, better BlueCruise performance, we've done it all with Mach-E for many years now.

 

Our vision is not just a powerful computer on wheels.

It's actually a robot.

 

We will link with these digital experiences.

Things that only a vehicle can really do, like safety and security, and the other innovative use cases we shared with you at Capital Markets Day.

 

These experiences that will drive higher profitability, accretive revenue and are the reasons for customers to actually stay with Ford and Lincoln, lower marketing costs, are now becoming clear to us.

One example on the retail side on the technology is our first implementation of the Phoenix system, we called the Lincoln Digital experience with our new panorama display in our new Nautilus.

 

This experience is really a differentiator in the luxury space with Google Maps and Google Assistant and enhanced carplay.

Our sales have surged for Nautilus 48%.

 

We now have much younger customers.

And the biggest application for this technology is BlueCruise and ADAS.

 

It's a leading hands-free driving technology in America, we believe.

We now have 415,000 enabled vehicles on the road.

 

That's a 25% increase in one quarter.

We have 213 million miles, three-million-plus miles of hands-free driving now since launch.

 

To better dimension our progress of software technology and services; in the quarter alone, total company paid subscriptions grew 40% to over 765,000 paid subscriptions.

Our integrated service revenue is now on track for double-digit growth this year.

 

We are targeting $1 billion of revenue next year for our software.

This revenue has gross margins of 50-plus-percent, which drives significant operating leverage and improved capital efficiency.

 

Now the major part of this new software business is actually Ford Pro, so let me touch on that.

The foundation of Pro is really simple.

 

It's our vehicles.

A robust and fresh lineup, the freshest we've ever had at Ford of ICE, hybrid and EVs, including the all-new Super Duty, the all-new Ranger globally, the all-new F-150 that has just finished its launch, the all-new custom Transit in Europe, and our two small vans in Europe, the new Transit Connect and Courier, and the new extended-range two-ton electric Transit we sell in both Europe and North America.

 

Now what these brand -- these brands and vehicles are seeing is resilient revenue streams based on a much longer tail spending on the infrastructure by government and private enterprise.

We also have a very robust and diverse customer range.

 

We dominate in small business and medium business with tradesmen, but we have very large customers.

We have state, local and national governments.

 

And we have rental, which by the way, is very profitable for Pro.

In fact, in the U.S., one out of four of these fleets, mom-and-pop tradesmen, all the way to large companies, one out of four of those fleets are U.S.

 

-- in the U.S.

are Ford only.

 

But the big opportunity for Pro is beyond vehicles and that's where we're focusing.

With Pro Power Intelligence, we have a highly differentiated telematics offering.

 

We offer real-time driver coaching, which provides significant improvements for driver safety and now is available in about half of our modem-enabled Pro vehicles.

This includes features like seatbelt and speed monitoring and harsh braking notification.

 

Pro Intelligence is also a platform for vehicle controls.

Our first foray, it's a big deal, is Fleet Start Inhibit, which protects our Pro vehicles from theft and also unauthorized use.

 

We will expand these vehicle controls to speed control and acceleration limits in the near term.

Now, no third-party telematics solution can offer this functionality because it's related to the vehicle.

 

We call it uncrossable moat for our software business.

Over four billion miles have now been traveled in the first half of this year on vehicles equipped with Pro telematics, insights and controls.

 

And our paid subscriptions for Ford Pro Intelligence grew 35% year-over-year, now including 610,000 paid subscriptions with a triple-digit growth in telematics fleet management and charging depot software.

Turning to physical service, which is the second big non-vehicle revenue and profit for us at Pro, we have a massive opportunity to grow physical services of parts.

 

In the first half of this year, Ford Pro was only 24% of our after-sales revenue.

It's a huge upside.

 

Bank of America estimated the profit pool for maintenance, repair and parts, physical repair of the vehicle that escape our dealer network is about $135 billion.

That's 2.5 times the profit dealers capture through vehicle sales and financing.

 

This is a huge untapped TAM.

Ford Pro already has the largest physical and mobile service network in North America, but for specialized commercial service, many of which is open 24/7 for our customers with specialty technicians.

 

And we continue to expand that physical network to a competitive advantage by adding Pro Elite centers and mobile service units.

We are on track this year to reach 27,000 commercial service base by the end of this year.

 

That is up 20% year-over-year.

Growth will be led by Elite base, the largest and most capable of the service base for Pro, which will more than quadruple this year to 1,300.

 

We are now on track to increase our mobile service units by 45% to 2,500 service trucks and vans.

That's 10% of our entire physical network.

 

Mobile service network is incredibly important competitively.

None of our competitors offer this kind of scale.

 

We address many repairs, limiting our downtime for our customers.

We service multi-make fleets, which helps us with our share garage unlike our competitors.

 

And global mobile repair orders that generated from this fleet is up 115% in the quarter.

Our focus on software and physical service expands the moat for Pro, while helping our customers improve productivity and grow their business.

 

Pro is on track for software and physical services to contribute 20% of our EBIT by 2026.

On quality, we're making progress with our latest vehicles.

 

Ford jumped 14 points in the latest J.D.

Power's 2024 U.S.

 

Initial Quality survey.

We went from 23rd in the industry to ninth.

 

Bronco Sport is now named the best small utility in initial quality, outperforming 18 competitors.

Our launch in initial quality are leading indicators for warranty in the future and we expect to see benefits in the future.

 

We did see warranty cost increase in 2Q, of course, tied to new technologies, FSAs and inflationary pressures for the cost of repair.

We expect technology-related warranty costs to now normalize, as technology matures and we deploy that great OTA capability to address known issues.

 

We are confident we are on the right trajectory with a very clear and non-negotiable mission at Ford to deliver best-in-class quality.

I'll close with this.

 

The remaking of Ford is not without growing pains, but is unlocking opportunity to serve our customers in growing ways we never thought possible.

My confidence comes from the fact that we have built a world-class team, and we are executing a compelling strategy.

 

No other company has Ford Pro.

We intend to fully press that advantage.

 

No company has a more compelling product lineup with an attractive mix of ICE and partially and fully electric options for both work and retail customers.

We also know we have a lot to prove.

 

We look forward to proving our EV strategy out.

That has become more realistic and sharpened by the tough environment.

 

Thankfully, we scaled years ago.

We are confident we can reduce the losses and sustain a profitable business in the future with everything we've known.

 

We look forward to proving that we can be profitable on smaller vehicles as well, not just on EVs, but across all of our powertrain choices.

It's time to prove our recent quality gains are repeatable and will flow to the bottom line.

 

Plenty of work ahead, but the direction is crystal clear to us.

We are building a high-growth, high-margin, more capital-efficient and more durable Ford.

 

John?



John Lawler

Thanks, Jim.

 

And I want to thank the entire Ford team for their hard work and continued focus on executing our Ford+ strategy.

And more importantly, we are working aggressively to remake Ford into a higher-growth, higher-margin and more durable business, as you said.

 

And frankly, a higher-performing company.

Our automotive business is solid and consistently generating strong free cash flow, which is a core ingredient to drive total shareholder returns over time.

 

Now in the quarter, we generated nearly $48 billion in revenue, with growth of 6%.

Wholesales were up 2%, as our fresh and compelling product line gave our retail and commercial customers unmatched freedom of choice.

 

The quarter benefited from record Transit wholesales, as well as the completion of our all-new F-150 launch, including drawdown of the inventory we had held at the end of the first quarter.

We delivered $2.8 billion in adjusted EBIT, with a margin of 5.8%, as higher costs were partially offset by the continued strength in Pro.

 

Costs were up year-over-year, primarily reflecting an increase in warranty reserves, higher new product-related material costs and higher manufacturing costs.

Now if you take a step back and look at our sequential performance, Q2 saw revenue growth of 12% on a 9% increase in wholesales, driven by higher truck volume and the strength of our product portfolio.

 

Despite this revenue growth, EBIT was flat, reflecting primarily higher warranty and manufacturing costs related to the inventory, which was driven by seasonality and the high-volume launches.

We remain on track to deliver $2 billion of material, manufacturing and freight efficiencies over the full year, which will partially offset higher labor and product refresh costs.

 

We are seeing emerging headwinds in warranty and inflationary pressures in Turkey, and we are working to mitigate these costs.

Now, I have more confidence in today's business than ever.

 

Our strong global product lineup is differentiated and driving continued top-line growth.

And we're slowly but surely improving our industrial system and shedding behaviors that have held us back in the past.

 

We're on track to deliver our full year guidance, and we are generating stronger and more consistent cash flow than just a few years ago, evidence that our Ford+ plan is working.

Adjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion in the quarter and $2.8 billion through the first half, resulting in a cash conversion rate of 51%.

 

Our $1 billion increase to adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year underscores our growing confidence in the business.

Our balance sheet remains strong with close to $27 billion in cash and $45 billion in liquidity, providing considerable flexibility in a very dynamic environment.

 

I'm also pleased to announce that we declared our third quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share payable on September 3d to shareholders of record on August 7th.

Now let me spend a few minutes summarizing the financial performance of our customer focus segment and highlight how each of them is driving Ford+ and making our business stronger.

 

Ford Pro delivered a 9% increase in revenue on a 3% increase in wholesales.

The segment has consistently delivered year-over-year revenue growth each quarter since we re-segmented our businesses.

 

EBIT was a solid $2.6 billion with a healthy margin of over 15%, reflecting increased Super Duty and Transit volume that are both capacity-constrained along with higher net pricing.

Ford Pro is the prototype for sticky high-margin, non-cyclical revenue.

 

Pro's results this quarter continue to demonstrate consistency, predictability and resiliency of this higher-margin growth business.

Ford Model e generated a loss of $1.1 billion as continued industry pricing pressures and wholesale decline -- wholesale declines of 23% more than offset lower cost.

 

Our team's intense focus on cost delivered about $400 million in savings to the bottom line in the quarter.

Key factors included reductions in material costs, improved battery economics and lower engineering.

 

This builds on the cost reductions we have achieved since the launch of our first-generation products, helping to improve our profit outlook as we head into '25.

Ford Blue revenue grew by 7% on a 3% increase in wholesales, led by growth in trucks and strong pricing.

 

Wholesales were impacted by the launch of the Explorer as we ended the quarter with about 21,000 vehicles in inventory for quality checks.

EBIT of $1.2 billion and a margin of 4.4% were both down year-over-year, mostly driven by higher warranty.

 

Once again, Blue was profitable in every region.

Our hybrid sales, up 34% in the quarter, continue to shine and our global hybrid mix is now approaching 9%, up over 2 points year-over-year with more products on the way.

 

Ford Credit generated EBT of $343 million, down slightly year-over-year.

As expected, auction values declined by 9%, and lease return rates continued to normalize from historic lows.

 

Credit losses and insurance losses were also higher, but mostly offset by an improvement in financing margin.

We continue to originate a high-quality book with U.S.

 

retail and lease FICO scores again exceeding 750 for the quarter.

Our exposure to EV residual risk is low as EVs represent less than 5% of our lease portfolio.

 

So now let me turn to our outlook.

As I referenced earlier, we continue to expect full year company adjusted EBIT in the range of $10 billion to $12 billion.

 

In general, we see supply and demand for vehicles in balance.

And industry dynamics, including market equations for our four segments, are playing out similar to what we forecast at the beginning of the year.

 

We are increasing our adjusted free cash flow guidance by $1 billion to $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion, supported by strong earnings and lower-than-planned CapEx.

We are keeping our CapEx target range of $8 billion to $9 billion and are focused on delivering at the low end.

 

Our outlook for the year assumes a flat to slightly higher SAAR in both the U.S.

and Europe.

 

Our planning assumption for the U.S.

is 16 million to 16.5 million units.

 

Full year of customer demand for all-new Super Duty contributing to better market factors for Ford Pro.

Lower industry pricing of roughly 2%, driven by higher incentive spending as we move through the second half of this year.

 

For Ford, we expect this to be partially offset by top-line growth from the launch of our new products, warranty reserve increases from software, higher repair costs and FSAs.

Our segment outlook anticipates continued Ford Pro strength, and we are increasing our EBIT range to $9 billion to $10 billion, reflecting further growth and favorable mix, partially offset by moderated pricing.

 

As expected, losses in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion for Model e, driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in new vehicles.

And for Ford Blue, we are trimming our EBIT range to $6 billion to $6.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation and higher warranty.

 

We expect Blue's profit trajectory to significantly improve in the second half, reflecting higher volume with the F-150, Explorer, and Ranger launches that we've just recently completed, and our recent capacity expansion on Bronco.

And we expect Ford Credit's EBT to be about $1.5 billion, double-digit growth year-over-year.

 

Now our performance this quarter demonstrates the positive progress on our Ford+ plan.

We're disciplined with capital, and we have the right portfolio of products, and we are delivering consistent cash generation to reward our shareholders.

 

We are relentlessly seeking out new ways to make our business better and remain focused on driving improvements in both quality and cost.

So that wraps our prepared remarks.

 

We'll use the balance of time for questions.

Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.

 

Please go ahead.



Adam Jonas

Hi, everybody.

 

Jim, you said that Ford is a different company from what it was three years ago, but the stock market really doesn't seem to agree with you at all on that.

Stock is down about 10% after hours and around $12 a share.

 

And my team just ran the numbers, Ford ranks 494 out of 500 companies in the S&P on PE.

Jim, do you -- my first question is, do you think Ford's stock is good value?

 



Jim Farley

Yes.

 

Yes, we're -



Adam Jonas

Then why does your -- then why does your Board refuse to authorize a share buyback?

 

And people on this call, I think they understand the reason, like the family element.

But in your opinion, if you're telling me the stock is a good value, and it's like the bottom one-percentile of the S&P, what's the plausible reason why -- do you really think you have better uses of capital than that?

 



Jim Farley

Yes, we do.

 

And I have to tell you that it's hard for people to understand those possible uses of capital, but we have so many exciting businesses to invest in.

And Pro is a great example.

 

I'm not going to get into specifics, Adam, but I think people will understand over time how many exciting opportunities there are at Ford.

And I'm not just referring to vehicles, I'm referring to non-vehicle activities.

 

We have 27,000 service base.

There's lots of opportunities.

 

And as I said, when you look at Ford Pro, I'll just deep dive on that one, and I'm so glad you asked this question, by the way.

So Ford Pro is a very, very high percentage of our company's profit.

 

Just look at the ratio between the overall company's EBIT in Pro and our guidance.

And then think about our after-sales business, only 24% of our revenue comes from Pro-related vehicles.

 

And we could spend a lot of time talking about this opportunity, but that's why I highlighted in my comments, there are so many places for us to grow Pro on the physical services.

They're like 35% margin, but it's hard stuff, right?

 

It's like bays and technicians and a lot of work.

We have very exciting electrical architecture investments that we have to make in our future that will really change our ICE vehicles and their revenue potential.

 

Because that revenue won't be just when we sell the vehicle, it will be over time, which we're seeing with Pro already.

So I don't want to belabor the point.

 

I'll just tell you there are plenty of opportunities.

Anything else?

 



Adam Jonas

Okay.

 

Just a follow-up on Skunkworks.



Jim Farley

Yes.

 



Adam Jonas

Your team has made a number of visits to China over the last couple of years, including, I think, just a couple of months back, I believe, you were there.

 

What are you learning from these trips?

And specifically, I mean, you mentioned China along with Tesla are the cost benchmark, but do you think Ford can bring to market a low-cost EV profitably without help from your partners in China or is China part of the solution?

 

And if China is part of the solution, then what are you going to do about it?



Jim Farley

Yes, great question and an important question for any OEM as the EV market evolves here.

 

Look, we made the bet on CATL many years ago.

It was a very important bet for our company to localize LFP cells in North America happen to be in Michigan.

 

We're two years into that project.

That is a signature partnership.

 

CATL is the largest battery maker in the world, and they lead iron phosphate cost and reliability.

That is a signature partnership that we launched many years ago that we've been working hard on, and Marshall is on track.

 

Look what Volkswagen is doing with XPeng, and many others who are kind of taking a Chinese low-cost platform and using that.

That's not our strategy.

 

Our partnership strategy will be on the component side, going deep into the supply chain for IP that is critical and unique.

I'm not going to get into specifics, but CATL is one example, and we're going to learn how to do that at the company.

 

We believe that this is essential know-how for the company because the true fitness test for EV profitability will be on these small vehicles.

And we have learned from our experience with Mazda and Kia and many others that we have to have this know-how in the company because it applies across all of our vehicles, not just EVs.

 

And the lowest cost is the most important capability.

We believe that many of our competitors will turn to their Chinese either independent companies or partners to basically use their platform globally.

 

We learned a lot, not just from China, but from MEB.

We've been scaling MEB.

 

We know the cost of Volkswagen.

They're one of the leaders in scale.

 

And what we found in that trip and subsequent trips to China is that we have a very competitive battery with CATL, but many of the Chinese players in the lower-cost have very affordable batteries, but they don't have the most efficient design outside of the battery on the other EV components.

And our team, the Skunkworks team, we might as well call it a big team now because it's no longer Skunkworks, we're betting on them as our affordable platform.

 

They have really designed breakthrough EV components with our own design that we think are better and cheaper.

And we have a very competitive battery localized with the IRA benefit.

 

And the partnership discussion, I think, will -- we think will largely put out in larger vehicles.

We think that's where the partnership -- big partnership opportunity really lies.

 

In the commercial vehicles that I talked about, I'm not -- we have nothing to say right now, but this is -- we -- why is the partnership so important?

Because the bigger vehicles have this kind of inverted cost, and the partners allow you to be more capital-efficient and have better returns.

 

And that's why we think that the partnerships on larger vehicles will play out as vibrantly as affordable vehicles.
Operator

The next question is from Bruno Dossena with Wolfe Research.

 

Please go ahead.



Bruno Dossena

Yes, thank you for taking the questions.

 

I was wondering if you could just contextualize what fundamentally within the organization you think is leading to these persistent warranty issues.

And I realize partly it's because it was on a prior industrial system, but just given how frequently the surprise warranty issues keep popping up, how do you have visibility or how can investors really build confidence in an earnings trajectory when, every year the surprise warranty issues keep happening?

 

Thanks.



Jim Farley

Thank you.

 

I think the most important evidence, the J.D.

Power's IQS, that's a really big point of evidence for everyone.

 

Our internal data, by the way, had been saying that for quite some time.

It's now verified.

 

I think that is clearly cutting the initial quality defects to a fully competitive rate, where we're leading some segments, will clearly bring our warranty down over time.

But it take -- as you said, it takes time.

 

You got to launch vehicles, you got to get in the industrial system and make sustainable changes.

The other one I would say is as painful it is quarter after quarter to have all these great launches, we do not release them until we're happy with the quality and that we've done all the testing.

 

And it makes our quarters lumpy and it's challenging, but it will reduce warranty over time.

When you look at the root causes for these issues, and I can go through the hundreds that we go through, it's very clear that these are issues many of which we could have caught at launch.

 

And that is what's happening now at Ford.

We have to go through all these launches to find these, and over time we're confident they come down.

 

The other thing we maybe made it more difficult in a way, but better for the company fitness-wise is we put a lot of new technology in our vehicles.

And that new technology is difficult for the dealers to diagnose when customers come in and say something is wrong with my SYNC system.

 

They replace modules unnecessarily, et cetera, and that hits our warranty reserves.

What we've found though is that this kind of fixing is different than mechanical fixes, where that OTA capability redirected to these defects can really reduce our cost outlays for the warranty -- against the warranty reserves.

 

And we're working all of those cost curves every day for each of our models.

John, anything to add?

 



John Lawler

Yes.

 

I think that, there's the lag that you're going to have between the quality improving and the warranty run rates improving.

And so, the first step, as Jim said, is the quality improving and we're seeing that in the physicals now.

 

And that lags, 12 to 18 months and we should start to see the warranty coming in.

On the prior models, majority of what's coming through our FSAs, we're doing things to fix those quicker, get out in front of them, reduce, the impact of them, but we're working that every day.

 

And it's an issue that the team is focused on, and the encouragement is that the quality is improving and that is the most important thing for the future of the business and the longer run rate of the business.



Jim Farley

What we won't do at Ford is reduce our actual cash expense at the expense of our customers.

 

We will fix these problems.

We will do the right thing.

 

I don't care if it costs rental cars or whatever.

We want to turn these quality issues into positives for our customer experience.

 



Bruno Dossena

Okay, thank you.

 

So maybe to step back, and I think this touches on Adam's Skunkworks questions, but when you compare Ford now to history, earnings are now significantly higher.

But the capital base has expanded such that returns really haven't improved.

 

And this isn't just Ford.

This is most Western automakers.

 

The earnings part of the equation is only partly in your control, but the structural costs are.

So how are you thinking about the trajectory of structural costs from here, even simply, are they going up or down?

 

And B, given this is a similar dynamic for a lot of automakers, and so many traditional automakers are investing billions in R&D, really trying to achieve the same thing with respect to EVs, make an affordable EV at scale to compete with Tesla and Chinese OEMs, why do you think the legacy OEMs are all doing this by themselves?

And why aren't there more partnerships?

 

Thanks.



John Lawler

Well, I would say that you have to think about how you're going to fundamentally change the development process.

 

I think that's the core thing.

It's not necessarily just doing it with somebody else.

 

Sure, we're looking to be as capital-efficient as possible, bring partners in -- partnerships in for capital, but you can do that on components and you can do that in other ways as well.

And we know and we've done a lot of work understanding what has kept this industry kind of in that penalty box that Adam was talking about, as you mentioned.

 

We're not capital-efficient, we're lower-margin, we don't grow enough and, we're not resilient and it's a very cyclical business, and we're working to change that.

We've walked through the areas that we're doing and attacking to improve those key areas.

 

But it's really about the efficiency of the design, and the Skunkworks team is doing something very different.

That team is unique for a traditional OEM, the talent on that team.

 

They're doing an agile waterfall systems integrated design process, which no other global OEM has done, a traditional OEM.

And we're really working that to be focused on what can happen from a tech standpoint as well.

 

And that vertical integration really helps us drive to those lowest costs.

And we're finding that there's ways to be more efficient in many ways than some of the Chinese by incorporating the technology that the team is able to bring forward and leveraging the know-how that they've had from the last products that they've put forward.

 

So I think there's a lot of opportunity for us with that team and the talent and the change in the process that's not only going to show up when we get to our affordable EVs that are going to come from them, but it's also important to understand that if you don't have that transfer function Jim talked about, the entire company isn't going to improve.

And by doing it within the company with that team, we have a much higher probability of that transfer function being successful.

 



Jim Farley

Yes.

 

And I would just emphasize that the ambition at Ford for partnering on EVs is record level high.

We're not going to make any announcements in earning call, but this is absolutely a flip-the-script moment for our company.

 

We have done partnerships like Volkswagen.

We have learned how successful -- how to be successful with the one-ton Transit that includes an electric vehicle.

 

We really see that opportunity in front of us.

But we are not going to partner to the level where we delegate our future and the future fitness for cost competitiveness outside the company.

 

We need -- and if we have a partner, we have to have that transfer function that John mentioned.

I would only say that we need as an industry to start focusing equally on the one-time cost investment in the electrical architectures and the transition to digital products.

 

Now the integrated services that we're finding, we have 765,000 paid subscriptions.

They were different than our competitors who just basically do it for infotainment.

 

We are basically, you know, productivity on Pro as well as BlueCruise.

And to take that to the next level, make that business supercharged, we need to invest heavily in electrical architectures, not just on our EVs, but also in our ICE vehicles and hybrid vehicles.

 

And that will be a one-time investment.

And the benefit of that was what I was trying to highlight in my script, which is when the economy turns down, we still have those subscriptions.

 

Our service business, customers turn to that even more in a downturn because they keep their vehicles longer, they have to do more maintenance.

These are ways to kind of derisk our exposure to economic cycles.

 

And we have to make OTA, the updated IVI system, the integrated services team, both B2C and B2B, our electrical architectures, these are all basic enablers that go beyond EVs.

And the industry is going through that transformation too, and I believe Ford is in advance of others because we have more complicated platforms than Rivian and many -- and Tesla and many of the other OEMs.

 

And because of that, we also have more scale.

We have more complexity, but we have more scale.

 

And I think that transition and kind of structural change in the industry is as big as the EV change.

We're going to get to $1 billion of revenue, we think, next year on software.

 

I wouldn't have thought of that two, three years ago.
Operator

The next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America.

 

Please go ahead.



John Murphy

Good evening, everybody.

 

Just to take it back to more sort of the core of the business.

Jim, I just wanted to go through some numbers or kind of your take on the Ontario Super Duty capacity add.

 

I mean, obviously, it's a big step-up in capacity for the Super Duty 100,000 units.

It seems like current demand would certainly soak that up or absorb that reasonably easily.

 

But I'm just curious, if you think we might be hitting sort of a peak in this truck, what's your sort of view on the ability to kind of sustain these high levels of demand and sell-through?

How should we think about incremental margins on that?

 

Because it seems like a $3 billion investment might have a payback of less than two years and then --



Jim Farley

Correct.

 



John Murphy

-- spin out a lot of cash real quickly, so it might be a really, really, really good investment.

 

So I was just wondering if you could talk about that and then also what kind of powertrains those trucks will have.



Jim Farley

Yes.

 

Thank you.

So powertrain-wise, it will be a diverse powertrain, multi-energy platform.

 

We will -- I'm not going to get into specifics, but you can imagine what we've done with F-150 and Transit Van, we've gone to -- and all of our commercial vehicles, a multi-energy platform.

So we will offer customers the choice that we think no other competitor will have.

 

And we're -- we believe we'll be a first-mover, if not the first-mover in multi-energy Super Duty.

Look, we saw the $1.2 trillion investment in Infrastructure and the Jobs Act.

 

That is coming home.

There's a 5G upgrade that's going now.

 

I think it's close to $300 billion investment.

And I think what's -- I'm really glad you asked this question, John, because it's not obvious to people.

 

The real part of our Super Duty business that is -- that has been under constant, supply strains is our chassis business.

It's about 25% of our entire Super Duty business, but they are not pickup trucks that people use like what you think in road construction.

 

These are people with bucket trucks doing 5G upgrades, heavy construction.

And that is the demand that we have not been able to fill.

 

Ford is -- and I'll give you an example.

We dominate ambulance in the U.S.

 

Ambulances tend to use our Super Duty chassis business.

The average age of an ambulance in the U.S.

 

is 15 years now.

They're all falling apart.

 

We have not been able to service that industry, and now we can with this incremental capacity.

And so it's an aged fleet, the chassis business.

 

It's got a ton of investment tails to it still.

And we lead in the industry because of our upfitter in the products.

 

And now we're going to take the lead on the multi-energy part.

That's kind of the story, and it will be a great payback.

 

And we wouldn't be doing it at Ford unless we thought this was going to -- this demand would last for many, many years to come, John.



John Murphy

Okay.

 

And if I could sneak just one more in, maybe for Cathy, on the used residuals or the residuals at auctions.

It seems like although down year-over-year, the last three quarters, they've stabilized and started to improve.

 

And I'm just curious what your outlook is there and it just seems like the supply is going to remain relatively constrained in the used market, the late-model used market.

So this might be a good guy, not just for Ford Motor Credit, but for resids and potentially, a lift or support for new vehicle pricing.

 

So just what are your expectations there and what are you seeing in the market, Cathy?



Cathy O'Callaghan

Yes.

 

So we're seeing auction values down about 9% this quarter year-over-year, but up sequentially about 3%.

We're expecting auction values to continue to decline in the second half of this year, and we're also expecting our return rates to increase as well in line with that.

 



John Murphy

Great, thank you.

 
Operator

The next question is from Dan Levy with Barclays.

 

Please go ahead.



Dan Levy

Hi, good evening.

 

Thank you for taking the questions.

I wanted to start first with a question on Pro where we're seeing these continued strong results and really pricing is doing a lot of the strength.

 

So I understand all the bits about, pent-up demand and that's really helping and there's really a thirst for these products, but maybe you can help give us some color on the sustainability of this pricing -- product pricing.

And specifically, A, how long is this tale of pent-up demand?

 

B, how much of the pricing is contractual versus, let's call it more spot retail, which would be more subject to the market fluctuations?

So any color on the trajectory of pricing in Pro given it's had such a strong run.

 



John Lawler

Yes.

 

So when you look at Pro, we've been talking about the fact that the demand-supply imbalance has been, great for the top line and it's been running pretty strong, right?

No surprise there.

 

We have been forecasting that we expect as we move into the '25 model year that there will be some of the top line coming off.

And that's in our guidance.

 

So we understand that over time, that's going to get chipped away at a little bit here and there.

But we also believe that there are very underserved segments like chassis that we're going to be able to provide product to, where there'll be more price stability as we move forward.

 

So we don't see prices collapsing.

Now when you look at our business, about, I would say, 60% of it or so comes from the fleets, which are negotiated on an annual basis.

 

Those have remained very strong the last couple of years.

I've talked about in the past that we'll start to see what the '25 model year contracts look like as we move through the third quarter.

 

Initial indications are continued, demand beyond what we can supply, but we'll work through that and we'll have an update as we come through third quarter.

But, we're seeing demand continue both on the typical fleet contracts as well as through the dealers when it comes to the smaller fleet customers, the fleet tail, we call it, where they're buying two or three vehicles at a time.

 

So we're watching this very closely, but so far with '25, early indicators are positive, but we need to really move through that process much deeper before we can say where '25 is going to fall out.



Jim Farley

I wish there were car wars for commercial.

 

Because if there was, we would see the product freshness at Ford be an outstanding situation for us.

So aside from kind of the industry backdrop of the industry pricing and the demand, I think one of the most important decisions we made several years ago is to go full in on Pro.

 

So we invested in a one-ton Transit, which is our profit machine in Europe.

We invested in new Ranger globally.

 

We invested in a brand-new Super Duty, including chassis, including multi-energy.

We invested in new F-150.

 

And we have all these new electric Transit, two-ton Transits.

That was very intentional.

 

We did it several years ago and now that will pay off, I believe, as we look into these multi-year contracts.

And I -- for Ford at least, it's very important to understand how outsized the freshness of our lineup is at Pro.

 

It's -- I've been here 16 years.

I've never seen all of our core products updated within a 12-month period like this.

 



Dan Levy

Great, thank you.

 

That's helpful.

As a follow-up, Jim, I'm wondering if you could just address the electrification strategy in light of the November presidential elections.

 

We know, obviously, there's one candidate who's talked about pulling back on the EV mandate, and there could be some implications on IRA or the federal or California mandates.

I appreciate you've talked about, the need to have flexibility, and I think you even referenced earlier on the call, that credits will play a role, but maybe you could give us a sense of, where the strategy is.

 

Is your strategy one that's more existential that - and clearly with Skunkworks, it seems to indicate that it is, versus a strategy that is maybe one that's just more meant to reach compliance with a long-term -- longer-term goal in mind, but maybe you can give us a sense of how the strategy might change, if at all, depending on the outcome of the elections.



Jim Farley

Yes, thank you.

 

Obviously, Ford has had a lot of history -- a lot of experience and wisdom after 120 years of elections.

And I would say think about our strategy this way.

 

We believe that the fitness of the Chinese in EVs will eventually wash over our entire industry in all regions.

And so we believe as a company, even if there were short-term adjustments we can make to a compliance-led, lower requirement lineup, we're not going to approach it that way.

 

We really believe what I said, which is that many Americans would find an electric vehicle lowering their cost, not everyone, but a high percent.

And we believe that to be fully fit globally, whether it's our Ranger business, our commercial business, anything really, we have to find a way inside the company to be fully fit with lots of partnerships on the supply chain side.

 

And so this is a kind of enduring strategy at the company.

It is not a strategy where we handicap the presidential election for the next one and the next one and see what we can get away with the EPA.

 

That is not how we run Ford because Ford has -- Ford didn't go bankrupt.

We have been enduring.

 

And the only way we believe to be enduring is to make money on small EVs and commercial.

And that's our bet.

 

You'll see it play out in coming years.

It's a big adjustment from our Gen 1 products.

 

I'm glad, as I said, we scaled 2.5 years ago because we could learn about the reality of the market equation, which is just requiring us to be more fit and move faster.

The EPA could certainly change, but it would take, as John said, several years for -- through legislation and lawsuits for that to change.

 

So even from a compliance standpoint, we can't really count on administrations changing this way or that way.

I've been to the Hill many times in the last month, talking to many Republican leaders of the country, and I always say the same thing to them.

 

Please realize that there's a subset of customers that absolutely would save money, and they're also, absolutely, a group of customers who like partial electrification.

And Ford's strategy is choice, manufacturing flexibility and choice.

 

We are not going to bet student body left on this or right.

We are going to give customers choice.

 

We're going to be flexible manufacturing.

That's why we want to be a first-adopter to an E-REV or whatever is next on partial electrification because we want to be first and best at that choice.

 

But on EVs, we need to be fully competitive with BYD, Geely, even our own partner Changan.

And the only way for us to have done that is through this small group in California.

 



Dan Levy

Great, thank you.

 
Operator

The final question today is from Ryan Brinkman with Barclays.

 

Please go ahead.



Ryan Brinkman

Hi, Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.

 

Thanks for squeezing me in.

I wanted to ask on the warranty performance that led to the higher cost.

 

I remember a similar issue with higher warranty expense back in 2022, which you then tied to, I think, a transmission installed on vehicles some years prior while noting that the quality on vehicles built more recently had improved.

So, I know you're prioritizing initial launch quality, including with the F-150, you discussed at length last quarter, but really any color you could share would be helpful such as, whether the higher warranty provision this quarter relates to a discrete issue like in 2022, or maybe you could share what age cohort of vehicles is driving the higher cost this quarter.

 

And then with that new provision, do you think you've got a better handle now on what future costs could be and the provision in future quarters, it could normalize lower as soon as next quarter, or how would you rate the potential for quality performance in older vehicles to maybe surprise negatively again?



John Lawler

Yes, Ryan.

 

I mean that's part of the issue is these are issues that are popping up in the field on these older models.

The largest one coming through is on a rear axle bolt for vehicles that were engineered for the 2021 model year was when they were introduced.

 

And if these things come through, at a higher time in service, we're made aware of them, we need to take care of our customers, we go out to fix them.

And we have several of those types of things popping up on older models.

 

We got a failed oil pump issue that's popping up on, 2016-launched vehicles.

And so it's clear that we had a period of time where the robustness wasn't what it needed to be and that's showing up.

 

And it is hard to predict on some of these units that have been out in the field for quite a while that one of these issues is going to show up, these longer-term durability and quality issues.

But we need to work through that.

 

And we do believe that overall, as we improve our near-term quality and that starts to show up in the field, that will allow us to, based on the rules that we have around how we do our accruals, bring down that overall accrual level.

So these types of issues if they pop up will have less of an impact overall because our run rate on quality will be improving.

 



Ryan Brinkman

Okay, thanks.

 

And maybe just a follow-up on how your comments there might relate to what Jim was saying earlier about Ford controlling the software stack from bumper to bumper, from all the over-the-air update capabilities.

What do these new capabilities mean for your ability to troubleshoot or prevent warranty issues in the future?

 



John Lawler

Those are critical because when you look at some of these things, that have been out in the field for a while that have failed, they crossover -- let's say they launched in a '16 model year was the first year it was done.

 

So it was designed and engineered in '13, '14, '15, launched in '16, and it's been out there for quite a few years.

With the connected vehicle and having the digital electrical architecture and us controlling the software across all of the operating domains, we will be able to get signals off the vehicle early to tell us whether or not we're having an issue in certain components.

 

And if we understand that early, we can understand the cause of that and then we can go out and minimize, reduce, get out there earlier and reduce the number of vehicles that are impacted and actually either do an over-the-air update, if we can fix it that way, or do a preventative maintenance type program for folks, which will be much cheaper than a field service action recall where you're replacing components and modules, et cetera.

So there's a lot of advantages through that connected data that we'll be able to run through warranty -- the warranty system.

 

That's more on the physical side.

On the software side, we'll be able to understand, when things are an issue much earlier and we'll be able to fix them through over-the-air updates, which will be a much lower cost as we move forward.

 



Jim Farley

And during our launches, Kumar and Doug have partnered in a way that hasn't been done at Ford for a while at least, where we are testing vehicles to failure and individual components to failure, which is not our launch standard, but we are now doing that.

 

And we are also looking at the DTC codes off the vehicle, especially powertrain DTCs, and running these vehicles at extremely high mileage, far beyond our standard for launch.

And that has caught many, many issues in our industrial system that we've been able to correct before we release the vehicle.

 

It's painful to have all these vehicles over quarter ends, but it's the right thing to do for the company and it is the only way, we believe, in addressing our warranty spend.



Ryan Brinkman

Very helpful, thank you.

This concludes the Ford Motor Company's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call.

 

Thank you for your participation.

You may now disconnect.

 ","Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the General Motors Company Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

 

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.

After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.

 

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, July 23, 2024.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.

 



Ashish Kohli

Thanks, Amanda, and good morning, everyone.

 

We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2024.

Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's investor relations website.

 

We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.

Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO.

 

Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.

On today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations.

 

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially.

These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC.

 

Please review the Safe Harbor Statement on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language.

And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.

 



Mary Barra

Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone.

 

I want to begin today's call by thanking the GM team, as well as our dealers, suppliers, and other business partners, for helping us deliver strong second quarter and first-half results, including record revenue in both periods.

There are four key drivers to our performance and our new hire guidance that I'd like to highlight.

 

First, our past investments have created a consistently high-performing portfolio of ICE trucks and SUVs from a volume, share, and margin standpoint.

Next, our EV portfolio is scaling well and gaining market share.

 

In fact, our U.S.

EV deliveries grew 40% year-over-year in the second quarter, while the industry grew at 11%.

 

We're encouraged by these early results because disciplined volume growth is key to earning positive variable profits from our EV portfolio in the fourth quarter and maintaining strong ICE margins.

Third, we continue to deliver stable pricing and our incentives on average have been more than 100 basis points below the industry average for four consecutive quarters.

 

And finally, with our new investments, we have even greater focus on margins and capital efficiency.

Great vehicles and better execution will continue to differentiate us.

 

In the first-half, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra volumes in the U.S.

were up a combined 5% versus a year ago, and we gained 3.5 points of market share with disciplined production and consistent pricing.

 

In addition, sales of our redesigned Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon mid-sized pickups were up 31% year-over-year with ATPs up 9%.

And SUVs were executing a full court press with eight all new redesigned compact, mid-size and full size models that began arriving in showrooms during the second quarter.

 

They include some of our most profitable nameplates, like the Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia, and the Buick Enclave, which will be available with Super Cruise for the first time.

We designed Super Cruise to let customers drive hands-free for hours at a time on far more roads and with far fewer disengagements.

 

Road testers at Edmunds.com rated Super Cruise the top hands-free driving system because it's confidence-inspiring, and its technical differences between our system and others explain why Super Cruise is so smooth.

The Chevrolet Equinox, our highest volume SUV, will also be all new, and we expect it to be more profitable than the outgoing model, just like our family of mid-size Buick, GMC, and Chevrolet SUVs.

 

This is a function of several strategic decisions we've made.

First, the styling is bolder and more truck-like for the Chevrolet's and GMC's, while the Buick Enclave adopts the brand's sophisticated new design language.

 

Next, we elevated the comfort and technology features to make them even more desirable.

Then we leveraged our proven platforms and component sets for lower cost and greater efficiency.

 

Winning with simplicity, which is our drive to eliminate unnecessary complexity in the way we engineer and equip our vehicles, will help ensure that we can continue to sustain and even improve our margins in the future.

For example, through smarter contenting and optimizing selectable options, we have been able to eliminate more than 2,400 unique parts on 10 vehicles we're launching through the first quarter of 2025.

 

On the 2025 Cadillac LYRIQ alone, we've reduced the part count 24% from the 2024 model year with no compromises to performance or features.

The list of parts or subsystems that we no longer need to design, engineer, source, install, and warehouse is extensive and includes complex and relatively costly seat assemblies, consoles, door trims, and [fascias] (ph).

 

A crucial element is reducing the number of buildable electrical combinations, which is delivering hardware and software quality improvements as well as savings.

The work is helping us meet our $2 billion fixed cost reduction program this year and the savings will be even greater in the future.

 

As I said before our EV portfolio is growing faster than the market now that our module issues are resolved and we are scaling production.

Our early sales are mostly incremental about 54% of customers are new to GM and we're working to increase our conquest rate by raising awareness and launching new models.

 

Our best-selling EV so far this year is the Cadillac LYRIQ and it is now the market leading luxury EV in 22 states including Florida, Texas, and Michigan.

The GMC Hummer EV and the Chevrolet Blazer EV are also building momentum.

 

To unleash the next cycle of EV growth we're scaling production of the Chevrolet Equinox EV with its unique combination of performance, technology, range, and affordability.

We delivered our first 1,000 units late in the second quarter and the reaction from customers, dealers, and the media is very strong.

 

One product reviewer said, Chevy seems positioned to grab a piece of the pie that no one else has quite grabbed onto yet, and we think that is spot on.

Then over the next several months, GMC will launch the Sierra EV, and the Cadillac LYRIQ will be joined by the OPTIQ, Escalade IQ and CELESTIQ.

 

We're especially excited about the OPTIQ.

Car and driver said it nails the compact luxury SUV formula.

 

Then next year, when we follow with the CELESTIQ, Cadillac will have a beautifully designed EV in every global luxury SUV segment.

We're going to focus on winning new customers with these nameplates, as well as with the next generation Chevrolet Bolt EV because they represent the largest growth opportunities for us.

 

But we've also made adjustments to ensure we have a balanced approach as the market develops.

This includes deferring Buick's first EV which had been planned for 2024.

 

As we're expanding choice, other barriers to EV adoption like public charging access are also improving.

We are working to finalize commercial agreements with Tesla to give our customers access to their charging network.

 

The IONNA fast charging venture we joined is expected to bring its first chargers online before the end of the year, and customers are telling us the drive-through plazas we're rolling out with Pilot company are the best public charging experience out there.

As excited as we are about our portfolio, we are committed to growing responsibly and profitably in any demand environment.

 

Over the next few years, third-party forecasters now see the EV market growing steadily, but more slowly than it did over the last few years.

As a result, we are adjusting our spending plans to make sure we're capital efficient and moving in lockstep with customers.

 

For example, our Altium cells joint venture continues to ramp up domestic battery cell supply this year, which is helping drive profit improvement in our EV portfolio.

As we go forward, we're going to bring additional capacity online in a measured cadence.

 

This will enable us to better optimize our battery chemistry and form factors to meet our customers' needs on cost and range.

We've also decided to reopen the Orion assembly as a battery electric truck plant in mid-2026.

 

The new timing is six months later than our plan heading into the year.

We're confident that we can meet customer demand for standout EV trucks in the interim by leveraging the production capability and flexibility we have in factory zero.

 

We will also continue to take advantage of the flexibility we have to mix production between ICE and EV at key plants.

Next I'd like to discuss our results in China.

 

As you know, the market has significant excess capacity, and many startups and established competitors continue to prioritize production over profitability.

We have been taking steps to reduce our inventory, align our production to demand, protect our pricing and reduce fixed costs.

 

But it's clear the steps we have taken, while significant, have not been enough.

We had expected to return to profitability in China in the second quarter.

 

However, we reported a loss and we expect the rest of the year will remain challenging, because the headwinds are not easy.

We are working closely with our JV partner to restructure the business to make it profitable and sustainable.

 

I'll close my opening comments by recognizing the progress Cruise has made over the last several months.

As you know, Cruise has returned to the road in Houston, Phoenix, and Dallas, and we recently provided them with bridge financing to support their operational cash needs.

 

We've also made several significant leadership appointments, including hiring Marc Whitten as CEO.

Mark has decades of experience on the front lines of technology transformations, which will be crucial as we move forward.

 

Our vision to transform mobility using autonomous technology is unchanged.

And every mile traveled and every simulation brings us closer, because Cruise is an AI first company.

 

We have some of the best engineers in tech building a cutting edge AI platform, harnessing the power of large scale foundation models to continuously improve safe AV performance.

The Cruise team will also simplify their path to scale by focusing their next autonomous vehicle on the next generation Chevrolet Bolt EV instead of the Origin.

 

It's a win-win for both GM and Cruise.

It addresses the regulatory uncertainty we face with the Origin, because of its unique design.

 

Per unit costs will be much lower, which will help Cruise optimize resources and enable them to deliver AV tech at scale as quickly as possible.

And the change will help GM fully leverage our investment in the Bolt EV with a major new customer for the product.

 

We think all of these are important steps that will help us attract those who believe in the Cruise mission and see the incredible long-term business opportunity of autonomous driving.

With that, I will turn the call over to Paul to walk you through our financial results.

 



Paul Jacobson

Thank you, Mary, and I appreciate you all joining us this morning.

 

Our second quarter results were driven by ongoing strong performance from our ICE business and stable pricing across the portfolio that once again outperformed our guidance assumptions for the quarter.

And I'm pleased to share that pricing has remained relatively consistent thus far into July.

 

As Mary mentioned, sales have been robust.

We launched our new mid-sized SUVs supporting stable pricing and generating stronger profit margins than preceding models.

 

Highlighting our focus on profitable growth, recent JD Power data showed that our U.S.

Incentive GAAP compared to the industry average is expanding.

 

In the second quarter we ran roughly 150 basis points below the industry.

While at the same time our U.S.

 

retail market share increased by 70 basis points, more than offsetting the lower fleet volume to rental companies.

Our EV portfolio is gaining momentum.

 

In the second quarter, our U.S.

EV deliveries were up 34% sequentially from the first quarter, driven by the Chevrolet Blazer EV and the Cadillac LYRIQ.

 

And moving forward, we'll also benefit from the Chevrolet Equinox EV, which delivers more than 300 miles of range and will be sub $30,000 after factoring in the consumer tax credit.

On capital allocation, we repurchased $1 billion of stock in the quarter, retiring another 22 million shares.

 

And in early July, completed the prior $5 billion stock authorization.

We ended the quarter with a fully diluted share count of $1.14 billion, a reduction of 18% from a year ago.

 

The open market share repurchases supplement the ongoing $10 billion ASR that is projected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year, bringing our share count down to 1.1 billion.

As a reminder, on the ASR, we paid the $10 billion upfront in December of last year and immediately retired 215 million shares.

 

In the first quarter, the first tranche was completed and we retired another 4 million shares.

In the second quarter, no additional shares were retired under the ASR as the banks continued to cover their positions in the 215 million shares they borrowed at the outset of the program.

 

In the fourth quarter, we expect to retire another 20 million to 30 million shares depending on several factors, including the average share price during that period, bringing the total number of shares retired under the ASR to around 250 million.

On top of these measures, last month the board authorized an additional $6 billion for share repurchases.

 

Considering our belief that GM's share price is still undervalued, you should expect us to remain active in future share repurchases, continuing the great progress we have made towards our goal of driving our share count below 1 billion outstanding.

Getting into the second quarter results, revenue was up 7% to $48 billion driven by higher wholesale volumes and stable pricing in North America.

 

We achieved $4.4 billion in EBIT adjusted, 9.3% EBIT adjusted margins, and $3.06 in EPS diluted adjusted.

Recall that in 2023 we had inventory valuation adjustments of $1.7 billion for battery cell and EV finished goods inventory.

 

We expected the allowance to be substantially lower in 2024 as we improve EV profitability and reduce our inventory levels.

We made good progress in these areas during the second quarter and therefore reduced about $300 million of the allowance.

 

And our guidance includes a similar benefit in both the third and fourth quarters, totaling around a $1 billion benefit for the full-year.

We achieved adjusted automotive free cash flow of $5.3 billion during the second quarter, similar to last year and driven by our strong core operating performance coupled with our capital discipline.

 

North America delivered second quarter EBIT adjusted margins of 10.9%, which resulted in $4.4 billion of EBIT adjusted, up $1.2 billion year-over-year.

This was driven by higher wholesale volumes, stable pricing, ongoing cost containment, EV valuation allowance benefit, and a non-recurrence of the $700 million LG expense that we took last year.

 

Pricing for the quarter was up $300 million year-over-year and better than what we assumed in our guidance, supported by new products like the Chevrolet Traverse.

Moreover, our HD pickups and full-size SUVs continue to drive robust demand, while maintaining low incentives.

 

We also benefited from our fixed cost reduction program, realizing $100 million from lower marketing spend, compared to last year.

We remain on track to achieve $2 billion of net fixed cost savings by the end of 2024.

 

Dealer inventory levels ended the quarter at 66 days.

This is temporarily above where we were tracking earlier in June, as we believe some sales for dealers using the CDK platform were delayed until the third quarter.

 

We will continue to monitor our inventory and adjust production as necessary to maintain our targeted inventory levels of 50 days to 60 days.

GM International second quarter EBIT adjusted was $50 million, down $200 million year-over-year.

 

China equity income was a loss of $100 million, down $200 million year-over-year.

Mary already touched on the difficult China market and the immediate steps we have taken with our JV partner to return it to profitability as soon as possible.

 

EBIT adjusted in GM International excluding China equity income was $150 million, flat year-over-year, but improved more than $50 million sequentially from the first quarter.

GM Financial has consistently performed well with second quarter EBT adjusted of $800 million, up $50 million year-over-year and tracking in the range of $2.75 billion to $3 billion for the full-year.

 

They continued to drive portfolio growth and paid a $450 million dividend to GM during the quarter.

Cruise expenses were $450 million in the quarter, down $150 million from a year ago, reflecting a reduction in operational activities and a technology improvement focus intended to meet the high performance bar expected for AVs.

 

We're very conscious of spend while at the same time efficiently expanding operations across Phoenix, Dallas, and Houston.

In addition, Mary explained how utilizing the next generation of the Chevrolet Bolt EV will aid in scaling our robo-taxi business to create a more cost-effective and scalable option.

 

However, the decision to pause the production of Cruise, Origin triggered a charge of roughly $600 million, which we recorded as a special item in the second quarter.

Let's move now to our updated guidance.

 

Given the positive momentum we've seen thus far and our confidence in the rest of the year, we are raising full-year 2024 guidance to EBIT adjusted in the $13 billion to $15 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted in the $9.50 to $10.50 per share range, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $9.5 billion to $11.5 billion range.

Our cash flow guidance increases larger than our EBIT increase, primarily due to production alignment to market demand and further working capital benefits over the balance of the year.

 

I'd also like to address why the implied second-half EBIT adjusted is around $2.5 billion lower at the midpoint of our guidance range, compared to the first-half.

There are three main reasons.

 

First, we are assuming a bigger pricing headwind.

Our guidance assumes pricing to be down 1% to 1.5 year-over-year in the second-half versus essentially flat in the first-half, which is a substantial improvement from where we started the year.

 

Second, roughly $1 billion of costs are second-half weighted.

This includes about $400 million higher marketing spend to support more launches in the back half of the year.

 

The remainder is related to higher commodity prices, particularly copper and aluminum, and the timing of other EV costs, which we do not anticipate to be ongoing.

Third, EV volumes are expected to build sequentially every quarter to achieve our full-year target of 200,000 to 250,000.

 

We produced and wholesale 75,000 GM Ultium EVs in the first-half of the year, and expect this number to accelerate as we launch and ramp our new vehicles.

As a result, mix will be a bigger headwind in the back half of the year, as EVs have a variable profit lower than the portfolio average.

 

We continue to monitor EV demand and inventory levels very closely.

We acknowledge that Ultium wholesales outpaced customer deliveries by about 2% to 1% for the first-half of the year.

 

This however is common when introducing a new vehicle given the need to build availability, options, and customer awareness.

As time goes on, if customer deliveries were to continue lagging wholesales, we will take proactive steps to balance production levels.

 

The last item on EVs is that I'm pleased to report that we are making good progress towards achieving vehicle variable profit on our EV portfolio in the fourth quarter.

Key drivers to reach this goal include improved manufacturing scale and efficiencies, including module and pack assembly; reduce cell costs from improved scale and performance at our Ultium cells JV, including working through our inventory of cells produced with higher battery raw materials.

 

This has helped reduce our average cell cost by roughly $30 a kilowatt hour, sequentially from the first quarter, and we expect further improvements in the second-half of the year.

And finally, improved vehicle mix as we scale our electric full-size trucks and SUVs.

 

In closing, we are committed to maintaining the strong financial performance we accomplished in the first-half of the year and consistently adhering to our capital allocation framework.

It is underpinned by a focus on cost containment, capital efficiency, and agility in navigating the complexities of our business.

 

We are differentiating ourselves from our peers with superior product offerings and improving execution.

We are market leaders in the truck and full-size SUV segments.

 

Growing market share in affordable SUVs and our refreshed mid-size SUVs are some of the fastest growing vehicles in the segment, while yielding higher profitability than the preceding models.

At the same time, we are growing and improving profitability on our EV portfolio, along with developing a world class software organization and making steady progress at Cruise.

 

As always, our customers and their safety will be at the center of everything we do and is fundamental to our continued success.

This concludes our opening comments and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.

 
Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Barclays.

 

Your line is open.



Dan Levy

Hi, good morning.

 

Thank you for taking the questions.

I wanted to start first with a question on pricing.

 

If you could just provide a bit of context on the pricing strength we've seen, not only in 2Q, but in 1Q, if you just look at the incentives, the incentives are clearly up, but your pricing has actually been net flat, any color behind this?

And then maybe you could just talk to the sustainability of this in light of the fact that we've seen some inventory normalization, but prices held in, do you view this price as sustainable beyond this year, factoring in that there is going to be some increase in incentives as inventory ticks up further from here?

 



Paul Jacobson

Yes, good morning, Dan.

 

Thanks for the question, first of all.

So what I would say is that obviously we've been very disciplined about our commercial strategy in going to market, and despite the fact that we've seen a little bit of pressure year-over-year on incentives, we've actually widened the gap in the quarter against our competitive set.

 

So demand for our vehicles is strong.

I think some of the offsets are our truck sales were up 5% in the quarter where we continue to pick up share.

 

And that's helped to offset some of the lower ATP vehicles and we've seen in the growth in the tracks, for example.

So I think we've been saying for a long time that our consumer has held up really well and it's been resilient.

 

And we expect that to continue to be the same way.

I think a big part of that is the strategy that we've undertaken about being very disciplined in inventory and the more data flow about producing the vehicles that we know that customers are demanding.

 

And when you combine that with the incredibly strong portfolio we have, I think this is the result.



Dan Levy

Great.

 

Thank you.

And a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your EV strategy, and this is in light of maybe some of the potential changes we may be seeing in the regulatory environment given the upcoming election.

 

You know there is obviously one candidate in the U.S.

Presidential election, who talked about pulling back the EV mandate and maybe there's some implications on things like IRA or EPA mandates?

 

So to what extent, if we see pullback in some of these standards, does that modify your EV strategy?

Is your EV strategy one that is, you know, driven more by regulations?

 

Or do you view your EV strategy as a bit more fixed given the long-term strategic goals of GM and also just the longer planning cycles for products.



Mary Barra

So thanks for the question.

 

Our strategy is to offer our consumers choice.

We've got an incredible portfolio of vehicles, both EV and ICE, and we've got flexibility.

 

So we know we can win more customers as they embrace EVs.

We're seeing that right now with 54% of the EV sales being customers that are new to GM.

 

And so we do think the market for EVs will continue to grow and we've got the performance, the technology and the range that customers want, especially when you look at our portfolio with the Equinox coming out right now, the affordability of that vehicle along with when we have the Bolt next year, if we're giving consumers that choice.

And as I've said, EVs are fun to drive, instant torque.

 

I think our EVs have beautiful designs, the right range, the right performance.

So again, we'll be guided by the consumer and regardless of what the regulatory environment is, regardless we're going to work to maximize, because we've got that flexibility between ICE and EV.

 

So I think we're in a very strong position.

I think we also have to look at though, the investments GMs made in EVs, we're creating 1,000s of jobs all over the country including Ohio, Michigan, and Tennessee.

 

So I'm pleased with where our strategy is.

I think regardless of what happens from a regulatory perspective, we're going to be well positioned with our ICE and with our EV portfolio.

Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi.

Your line is open.

 



Itay Michaeli

Great.

 

Thank you.

Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the quarter.

 

Maybe a first question for Paul back on the second-half, and thank you for the color.

On the 1%, 1.5% negative pricing assumption, how does it compare to what you're assuming for the industry in the second-half?

 

And also, how should we think about the high level sensitivity to EV volume target second-half of the year?

The volumes that come in lower, I think about the puts and takes in the model for that?

 

And secondly, maybe for Mary, on Cruise, how do you think about strategically taking Cruise to market as a ride share operator, as opposed to maybe finding partners to deploy on the next generation boat?



Paul Jacobson

Thanks, Itay.

 

I'll go ahead and start with the first questions.

On the second-half, we tend to stay very, very focused on what we see for pricing for ourselves.

 

Obviously, there's a lot of noise going on with different incentive strategies, different inventory levels, et cetera.

So that's an assumption that we bake in based on what we're seeing in the market and making sure that we're projecting the right amount of conservatism against our cash flow targets and plans.

 

So we started the year saying down 2% to 2%.

We got through the first-half of the year essentially flat.

 

And what I would say is July to-date looks very similar to June.

So we're going continue to push through month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter on the portfolio that works for us.

 

So we've managed to do that through various incentive strategies and various inventory pushes that we've seen from our competitors.

And we're going to just be focused on meeting our customer demand the best way we can.

 



Mary Barra

And Itay on -- as it relates to Cruise, we've worked very hard.

 

As you look at what's happening with artificial intelligence applications across many industries, customers have an expectation of higher performance from technology than they necessarily do in our case for other human beings.

And so our target now instead of being better than average driver is to be better than a role model driver.

 

And tremendous work has gone on over the last few months.

So as we are rolling out now in the three cities I mentioned, the technology is much more advanced to be better than a role model driver.

 

We've also expanded our safety metrics to make sure it measures across many scenarios.

So I'm very confident as we now have vehicles operating and we're on the path very quickly to get to -- back to driverless with much safer technology, again, getting to this better than a role model driver.

 

So when I look at that, we can provide an exceptional driver experience as we continue to grow.

Now when you talk about what is the right balance between expansion, capital demands and partners and/or investors, we're very open, and we're seeing significant interest in Cruise.

 

So as we move into this next phase, we're going to be looking at what's the right efficient way to go forward with Cruise from a robo-taxi business from a Cruise perspective.

But also we are seeing very laser-focused on the personal autonomous vehicle opportunity for GM.

 

So we think we're well positioned.

We'll share more as we go through the year, but we have significant outside interest from a partner and investor perspective.

 



Itay Michaeli

Perfect.

 

That's all very helpful.

Thank you.

 



Paul Jacobson

Itay, let me just go back.

 

I think I missed the second part of your question on the sensitivity to EV volume from that.

So you saw when our -- we originally gave our guide on production, we were at 200,000 to 300,000.

 

We talked about being able to get to variable profit positive in the low 200,000.

We're still holding to that, although with the 200 to 250, we pulled that from the second-half to the fourth quarter.

 

So I know it doesn't give you a specific answer, but directionally, obviously, scale is a big part of what we're doing.

A lot of the battery costs, cell cost improvement that we've seen has just been driven by efficiency and scale at the plant.

 

So it's something that we continue to watch, and we're continuing to strive for it.

But nothing more specific than that.

 



Itay Michaeli

Terrific.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with UBS.

Your line is open.

 



Joseph Spak

Thank you.

 

Good morning everyone.

Paul, thanks for all the additional color on cost and back half.

 

I guess to counter some of those higher costs you mentioned, right, you still have the fixed cost savings program, you're on track for the $2 billion.

If we're sort of tracking this, it looks like you did maybe $1 billion last year and maybe $400 million in the first-half, so another $600 million in the back half.

 

I just want to make sure that's sort of ballpark correct?

And if it is, just maybe some color on why it's actually accelerating or higher because I think like if we think about last year, the costs also were more back-end loaded.

 

So it's sort of a tougher comp.

So what else is being done here to drive the cost savings higher?

 



Paul Jacobson

Yes.

 

Good morning, Joe.

Thanks for the question.

 

So I would say directionally, your math is pretty accurate on about the $1.4 billion of the $2 billion.

I would look at the biggest cost increase that we highlighted on the call is about $400 million of marketing spend, and that is first-half to second-half.

 

So marketing spend overall is still down significantly, and the team has done a great job of driving more efficiency into what we're doing.

But obviously, with the launches that we have in the second half of the year, there's a significant lean in to drive that customer awareness.

 

And we think that's actually an opportunity for us to help us scale and to help us see us outside share gains in EV.

So I would say it's timing within the larger pool of significant savings initiatives out of that category.

 

That's the biggest piece of it.

But we're continuing to work on it.

 

And we believe that we'll be successful in that $2 billion cost reduction target that we laid out, and we're not going to stop there.



Joseph Spak

Okay.

 

Thanks for that first-half, second-half clarification on the marketing.

And then, Mary, just on the Origin decision, obviously, some cost savings.

 

But I guess, is there also -- and I know I think you're still undergoing the strategic review for Cruise.

But does this also indicate a change in go-to-market strategy and sort of not having that purpose-built vehicle?

 

Like what were some of the other considerations?

Is sharing just not really, you think, viable for that business model?

 

Or are there other use cases versus what you're originally planning for?



Mary Barra

I think the main reason is with going -- switching from the Origin to the Bolt is we extinguished the regulatory risk.

 

Remember, because the Origin doesn't have steering wheels and some other motor vehicle safety standard components, it doesn't meet motor vehicle safety standards.

There's -- that requires a legislative change.

 

We've been working on that.

It's been difficult to get done.

 

And with that, if we don't get that legislative change or authorization from a government perspective, we're limited in the number of Origins we could put out.

So as we looked at this, we thought it was better to get rid of that risk.

 

And then when we look at the Bolt, it's been, I think, a very good product for the initial rollout from an AV perspective where we have over 5 million miles traveled.

And it allows us to be more capital efficient and get better scale on the Bolt EV as we roll out next year based on the LTM platform.

 

So I would say it was mainly driven by the uncertainty that we have from a regulatory perspective.



Joseph Spak

Okay.

 

Thank you very much.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Daniel Roeska with Bernstein Research.

Your line is open.

 



Daniel Roeska

Hey, good morning, everybody.

 

Thanks for taking my questions, Dan from Bernstein.

Maybe following on, on the EV questions we've had.

 

Could you elaborate a bit on your outlook for emissions compliance?

Kind of if we stay within the current EPA framework, kind of what level of drivetrain mix credit would you expect to need to have to achieve the 2027 target?

 

And then following on from Dan's question earlier, if any administration or either administration should decide to revisit the EPA targets, could you outline what you would expect, what the timeline would be to actually be effective for 2027?

So what is the latest point in time when an administration then EPA would need to kick off kind of that process to revisit the 2027 target?

 

Thanks.



Mary Barra

Sure.

 

Well, for General Motors to comply with the existing regulations, we have many levers that we can pull, including how we plan our portfolio, the technology that we use on the vehicles.

We can utilize credits from prior and future model years and purchase credits as well as have a robust EV portfolio.

 

And so we look at this on a regular basis based on what's happening with EV adoption, what's based on what's happening with the regs and make those decisions.

So it's something we have a lot of flexibility.

 

And obviously, we intend to meet the regulatory environment.

It's really hard for me to predict what the timeline would be if something is going to change.

 

I would though that we just -- we look at our portfolio on a regular basis with not only what we know the regs to be and make sure we have a plan there.

And then we do scenario planning for what potentially could happen, and then we have that range of opportunities.

 

So we'll continue with that process.

I mean if you think about it for the last several years, the regulatory environment has not been certain.

 

I would say what's really important to the company overall is to have regulatory certainty.

And so we'll be watching with interest as we get past the election and look at what the regs will be if they change at all.

 

But I think we have the flexibility to moderate based on what we see.



Daniel Roeska

Thanks, Mary.

 

And maybe following up, if the regulations for 2027 kind of stay as they are right now with a more ambitious path, what role could mild or full hybrids kind of play in your portfolio?

And if they stay as ambitious as they are right now, would you consider to kind of increase your focus on hybrid drivetrains in the U.S.?

 



Mary Barra

Well, as we've said, we plan to have hybrids in key segments, not across the board, but in key segments in the 2027 time frame because of where the regulatory environment looks to be right now.

 

So we have that opportunity.

We can decide what we put on the fleet or what segments we put based on where we see the regulatory environment.

 

So that's definitely one of the technologies that we can leverage.

And as we've already said, we plan to have hybrids in key segments in the '27 time frame.

 



Daniel Roeska

Great, thanks for confirming that.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.

Your line is open.

 



Ryan Brinkman

Good morning.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

Obviously, there's the strong performance in North America that is the driver of the total company results.

 

Certainly, congrats on that.

I do think to ask, though, on the performance in China, including after it was a little surprising to see the equity loss fairly consistent with 1Q despite a solid rebound in both wholesales and non-consolidated revenue.

 

I know you don't provide a detailed bridge for the nonconsolidated ops specifically.

But from the sequential volume change, it would seem to imply in either price or mix or cost headwind quarter-over-quarter.

 

I'm guessing price, given some of the comments from other automakers in that country, but perhaps you can fill us in there?

And then I'm not sure if you're able to comment on what actions might be being considered in connection with your partner, but should we expect more that you are readying a portfolio of vehicles, maybe NEVs that you expect could gain greater traction?

 

Or are you contemplating more rightsizing actions or some combination?

And if you were to undertake rightsizing actions, I can't really remember you reducing capacity in that country before, at least not structurally.

 

So perhaps you could update us on what kind of flexibility you might have in that market to take capacity out.

How does it compare to North America today, for example, or maybe to Europe in the past when you operated in that region?

 



Mary Barra

Yes.

 

First off, we continue to see the challenges in China.

Very few people are making money, and a lot of OEMs are prioritizing production over profitability.

 

So I think the work that we have been more disciplined than most in our pricing.

We are launching some new vehicles that we're seeing positive traction.

 

But it's a difficult market right now.

And frankly, it's unsustainable, because the amount of companies losing money there cannot continue indefinitely.

 

And really, when you get into the type of pricing war that's going on now, it's really a race to the bottom and destroy residuals.

There's nothing good that comes from the behavior that we're seeing right now.

 

Having said that, we are taking -- we've taken several steps of getting our inventory right, launching some products that we think are going to be better received in some of the NEVs we had a couple of years ago, especially hybrids and full electric.

And then as it relates to the work that we're doing with our partner, out of respect for our partnership, we'll provide more details as the decision is made.

 

But I'm not going to go into detail of all the different items that we're contemplating.



Ryan Brinkman

Great.

 

Thank you.

And maybe you could comment quickly, too, on the trends in your other international operations, including in the consolidated operations in Korea and Brazil to.

 

I'm curious on the trend there.

Thank you.

 



Mary Barra

When you say the trend, you're talking about -- can you say a little bit more what your specific -- specifically...

 



Ryan Brinkman

The trend in the profitability in those markets for you?

 



Mary Barra

I would say in our GM International markets outside of China, we're seeing strong pricing.

 

If you look at South America, for example, Chevy is considered a premium or luxury brand.

And we've got a really strong portfolio with great brand loyalty and brand recognition.

 

And we're seeing -- we're able to hold pricing and compete, by the way, because of the value of the Chevrolet-branded products.

Again, in different -- we're seeing that across to varying levels across all of the international markets.

 

So again, disciplined execution pays off over the longer period, and this is a long game that we play when we look at managing our brand strength, managing the residuals of our products, et cetera.



Ryan Brinkman

Our next question comes from Dan Ives with Wedbush.

Your line is open.

 



Dan Ives

Yes, thanks.

 

I have a question with -- when you think about new GM customers looking at EVs, and that trend has been high, is that something that you expect to continue or maybe even could accelerate depending on the models and the price points when you look out the next, call, one to two years?



Mary Barra

Absolutely, Dan.

 

I believe when you look at the portfolio entries that we have coming, the fact that we have fresh designs, the performance and technology on these vehicles, along with the range is right.

So for those that are already EV and tenders that might want to replace the existing EV they have, I mean, the response we're getting from dealers about the new Equinox EV is just outstanding when they say they look at the design of the vehicle, the performance and the affordability, especially with the consumer tax credit.

 

So I think we have an opportunity to continue to outperform where the industry is, and we're going to look to build on that because we really believe in our portfolio.

That's why we're spending the marketing dollars to make sure we get the awareness, and our dealers are excited.

 

So I feel like we're well positioned to continue that growth.



Dan Ives

Great, thanks.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.

Your line is open.

 



John Murphy

Good morning everybody.

 

I just wanted to follow-up on pricing.

And Paul, I mean, you guys updated your guidance and a little bit optimistic -- more optimistic about what's going on in the second half and you had been full-year and had good performance in the first-half?

 

But as we think about pricing, there's two components that are, I think, being left out of the equation.

I mean the first is over the last two years, we've seen a 400 basis point increase in loan rates, right?

 

Dumb guys math on $50,000 ATP, that's $2,000 a year, four-year ownership cycle, it's $8,000 headwind to your consumer.

And you have dealers earning twice as much as they did in 2019 now.

 

So they have $2,000 to kind of potentially throw in to the equation to help get deals done.

So there's -- as rates come down and dealers get more realistic about what they can earn on your vehicles, I mean, is there a lot of room to support pricing where it is and potentially God forbid as rates come down, pricing to go up, right?

 

I think everybody kind of has this view that it's going to fade, but it might be much more resilient and stronger over the next year or two than people are expecting.

What's your take on sort of those two points?

 



Paul Jacobson

Yes.

 

Thanks, John.

What I would say is it starts with the portfolio.

 

When you look at the refreshes that we've done and what we brought to market and what's still come with the midsize SUVs, I think the team has done really an incredible job.

And that's actually held up quite well even as we went to higher interest rates.

 

And despite the fact that payments have gone up, we've seen demand hold pretty steady across the board.

So we want to maintain some level of consistency, which is make sure that we approach the plan, the forward calendar with a little bit of conservatism on the pricing side versus what we're seeing in the market today because that's -- it's really all about continuity on cash flow and margin performance.

 

So I think it's a strategy that's worked well for us.

Like I said, despite the fact that we've taken that assumption down in the back half of the year from where we started the year, we're still not seeing that in the month of July to date.

 

So I think this helps us be more nimble, be more agile and look around corners.

But our commercial team is doing a really good job of go-to-market strategies and really looking at it on a month-by-month, product-by-product basis to drive our optimal margin performance.

 



John Murphy

So we really should think about this as a planning assumption as opposed to an actual forecast.

 

Is that a fair statement?



Paul Jacobson

Yes.

 

That's the way we've consistently referred to it.



John Murphy

Okay.

 

And then just one follow-up.

CAPU when we look at your tables, I always ask about this, is 108% in North America, two-shifts straight time.

 

God forbid, we saw an actual increase in unit volume, up 5% to 10% for you and maybe the industry alike?

What kind of cost would flow back into the system?

 

Will we be thinking about mostly variable costs?

I mean, I see with that high CAPU, you might think that you might have a little bit of fixed cost that could come in as well.

 

But I'm just curious how you would think about that cost flow if we got a real volume lift of up 5% to 10%.



Mary Barra

Well, first of all, we'd be very excited about that because I think it's a huge opportunity.

 

And I think for the bulk of it, it would be variable cost increases as we've got the equipment adding shifts, increasing line rates.

So it's always fun to take volume up, and I think we're well prepared to do that, and it would mostly be variable.

 



John Murphy

Super helpful.

 

Thank you so much, guys.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore.

Your line is open.

 



Chris McNally

Thanks so much, team.

 

Great quarter.

Paul, maybe just a question around the variance that maybe remains in the guide.

 

So as been discussed, just high level, the pricing has gone from 2% assumption for the full-year to sort of 0.75%, given your second-half comment.

If I just run that pricing variance of 50 basis points for the -- for just the second-half, about $400 million of variance?

 

Maybe you can go through some of the other aspects that are sort of left to be determined because it seems like there's a lot in your control, so maybe China and any of the cost reductions just how we sort of fill that other $1.5 billion in the variance in the guide?



Paul Jacobson

Yes.

 

So thanks for that, Chris, and thanks for the kind words.

What I would say is that if you look at from where we started the year, it's about probably $2 billion of trend line improvement from our initial guide.

 

We've taken our guidance up now by $1 billion.

The other $1 billion, I would say, is largely China underperformance.

 

We started the year thinking that we were going to be similar to last year's profitability.

Obviously, we've taken that down.

 

And then the second area is really on EV volumes.

So despite the fact that they come in at a lower contribution, we were projecting on the higher volumes a variable profit contribution in the third quarter that has now been kicked out a little bit on the lower volumes.

 

That explains really the bulk of it.

But I'm really pleased that we've been able to take our guidance up now in two consecutive quarters.

 

And we're a full $1 billion at the midpoint ahead of where we were at the beginning of the year.



Chris McNally

That's a great summary because that was my second question.

 

Okay.

So pricing from the beginning of the year, $2 billion better, $1 billion is now reflected in the guide.

 

And the $1 billion offset is a combination of some China variance that's underperforming.

Probably second half is a little bit left to be determined and also EV volumes.

 

Is that a fair summary?



Paul Jacobson

Yes.

 



Chris McNally

Perfect.

 

Thanks so much, team.
Operator

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.

Your line is open.

 



Mark Delaney

Yes, good morning.

 

Congratulations on the strong results and thanks for taking my question.

You mentioned watching EV inventory levels closely and using demand as a guide for how fast you ramp up EV production?

 

To the extent GM does less than the 200,000 EV wholesales this year you're currently contemplating, could the company still be variable profit positive in the fourth quarter perhaps with incremental cost actions?



Paul Jacobson

Mark, thanks for the kind words, and appreciate the question.

 

I would say that when we started the year, we were looking at getting to variable profit low 200,000 range.

We're obviously continuing to do the work that we need to do on the lower volumes, and we see that.

 

I mean to the extent that we see volumes going lower, we obviously have to adjust to that, but we're really focused on the long-term here.

And that is the trend trajectory of scaling up in the business.

 

We're already seeing meaningful cost improvements as we ramp up the battery cell plants and really come off some of the imported cells and things that we were doing last year.

So this is a journey for us, and it's one that we're absolutely focused on doing.

 

So we don't want to end up in a situation where we're just producing to a target, and the demand isn't there.

We've seen what happens when you do that, and you've got residual value implications, which stay with you for a long, long time.

 

So that balance is what's most important to us and continuing along the journey.

So we're focused right now on that 200 to 250 and believe that we can hit the variable profit positive in the fourth quarter.

 

And we're going to continue to work towards that best we can.



Mark Delaney

Understood, thanks.

 

My other question was on GM Financial.

It looks like you slightly raised the EBIT outlook for the year to $2.75 billion to $3 billion.

 

I think as of the first quarter, you were thinking $2.5 billion to $3 billion.

Maybe talk about what's driving the slight uptick in GM Financial.

 

And more broadly on the financial market in auto finance, we've heard and read about some rising delinquencies for the industry more generally.

Maybe speak about GM Financial and any change in delinquency rates.

 

Thank you.



Dan Berce

Yes.

 

This is Dan Berce.

So on the first part of your question with respect to the uptick in the lower end of the guide, we obviously had a strong first-half at GMF earning $1.6 billion, which puts us in a really good position to hit in that range of $2.75 billion to $3 billion.

 

The couple of factors that would be headwinds in the second-half are that we're going to have less lease terminations in the second-half, along with expectations for mildly lower used car pricing.

And then the second factor in the second-half is that our credit typically seasonally in the second half is weaker than the first-half, so our provisions will be higher.

 

So that's really the reason for a slightly weaker second half.

Now with respect to your question about credit trends, first of all, baseline, our portfolio at GMF is 75% plus prime.

 

And we're seeing very, very steady performance for the prime customer.

They still have excess savings.

 

The -- obviously, the job market is strong.

And so that piece of our portfolio has been really stable.

 

Now the less than prime, like other lenders, we've seen a bit of deterioration mostly from vintages in 2022 and 2023.

More recently, we've seen stabilization, albeit at slightly higher levels.

 

But we've seen stabilization in that part of our portfolio.



Mark Delaney

Our next question comes from Tom Narayan with RBC.

Your line is open.

 



Tom Narayan

Hi, yes.

 

Thanks for taking the questions.

My first one is on Level 2 plus subscription take rates.

 

Tesla is seeing what many would describe as somewhat disappointing, I think, single-digit percentage take rates of its FSE product.

BMW told us last week they're seeing 30% plus take rates on its five series in California, and its pricing is a lot lower than Tesla's.

 

Just curious if you've given your take rates from Super Cruise or if you had any commentary on what you think drives demand there.

There's a saying that safety is boring.

 

Perhaps it was all about pricing.

Just love to hear any thoughts there, and then I have a follow-up.

 

Thanks.



Mary Barra

Our Super Cruise ramp has been slow because of some of the chip availability that we have.

 

We're now expected by year-end this year to have Super Cruise on 22 nameplates and in some cases, on up trims for instance, on the new Traverse standard.

So I don't have the specific take rates because it's -- part of it is it comes with the vehicle, and some of it can be something they can subscribe to.

 

So we can follow up with you after the fact on that.



Paul Jacobson

Yes.

 

And Tom, I'll just add.

It's just -- it's a little bit too early because we're coming through that trial period in significant volumes.

 

So we should have a lot more color, I would say, over the next 12 to 18 months as we start to see people lapse out of their three-year period and getting to that.

But it's obviously something that we're watching in the commercial teams all over it.

 



Tom Narayan

Great, thanks.

 

And then as a quick follow-up, actually, to Joe's Cruise question, I understand the pivot here to Bolt.

But I remember the decision to do Origin was largely an economic one.

 

So just curious if you're still in tandem to the new approach, still going to continue maybe lobbying for this purpose-built vehicle to regulators?

Thanks.

 



Mary Barra

Yes.

 

We definitely will be looking for, frankly, more than just what the vehicle is, but to have the right regulatory environment to release this technology that we believe definitely improved safety of miles traveled for everyone.

So we're going to continue to work hard to continue to allow autonomous technology, both rideshare and from a PAB perspective to continue.

 

And frankly -- switching to the Bolt at this time because of the regulatory environment actually improves Cruise's costs.

So we think it's a win-win.

 

But we're in the early, early phases of what rideshare is going to be and how we're going to leverage autonomous technology.

I do think in the future, there's going to be opportunity for a vehicle like the Origin.

 

And so that remains open to us at the right time.

This was about getting cost down at Cruise and being able to scale without regulatory uncertainty.

 



Tom Narayan

Got it.

Thank you.

 

Our last question comes from James Picariello with BNP Paribas.

Your line is open.

 



James Picariello

Hi, good morning everyone.

 

To follow-up on China, challenges are expected for the second-half.

But just to put a finer point on this, is the expectation for JV losses to sustain in the third and fourth quarters?

 

And then just high level, what are the pillars here to GM's China strategy going forward?

What should turn this around as we consider next year and beyond?

 



Mary Barra

Well, I think critical is we've got to get the -- our structural cost right to the new realities of this market.

 

And so we are fully recognizing that we -- the ongoing challenges that we have.

And so we're going to -- there's a three-pronged strategy we've got to execute the plan to align production to the current retail reality, get rid of the existing higher inventories and then aggressively reduce the structural cost.

 

From an SGMW perspective, we actually maintained a stable market share as this operation is very important and also support some of the global emerging markets through exports from our General Motors perspective.

And then as we've talked about in the past and Paul mentioned it, we have the premium channel, where we believe we have an opportunity to export with very low capital investment, very capital efficient, I should say, to take some of our most iconic products and export them into the market at the top end.

 

So I think when we look at the strength of the Buick brand and the China brand, there's a path forward in this market that we do believe over the course of the midterm is going to resume to growth.

So that is our plan, and I'm not going to predict where we're going to be exactly in the second quarter.

 

I will just tell you, we're working aggressively to improve that situation and leverage what we have in GMW and also the opportunity that we'll have with the premium channel.



James Picariello

Got it.

 

That's helpful.

And then just with respect to the second-half versus first-half, can you provide additional color on the $1 billion in additional costs that were referenced in the second-half.

 

What's driving that outlay?

And has this number changed versus your prior guidance?

 

Thanks.



Paul Jacobson

Yes, James.

 

So the biggest piece of it to be highlighted is about $400 million of marketing spend, which is seasonally weighted towards the second half of the year in conjunction with a number of the launches that we have.

We knew that going into the year.

 

The other big piece of it, I would say there are some commodities and EV cost retimes.

So these are a little bit new, just as we've kind of pivoted on our assumptions going forward.

 

The commodities, look, we're going to respond to that, and we always do.

But those are the 3 biggest categories, I would say, on the second-half.

 

And the team is working through it and feel good about our performance so far.



James Picariello

Appreciate it.

 

Thanks.
Operator

Thank you.

 

I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments.



Mary Barra

Thank you very much, and I hope everybody can see that from our results and our new higher guidance, we are making the most of every opportunity we have in ICE and in EV and leveraging our core strengths.

 

We're being flexible and opportunistic, but also importantly, we're being very disciplined.

A better Cruise is moving forward once again, and there's significant opportunity there.

 

We're going to continue to return significant capital to our owners as we move forward and the opportunity presents itself.

So if you look back, this was a great first-half.

 

And we're going to build on it and continue to improve the business, and we have more opportunity to continue to do that to drive our future success.

We're going to expand on all these topics at our Investor Day in Springhill, Tennessee.

 

And so I hope you will attend.

You're going to have a chance to drive our newest ICE and EV products and see close up our cell manufacturing expertise and our manufacturing flexibility.

 

We think it's compelling, and we look forward to having that session with all of you.

So thank you very much for joining, and I hope you have a great day.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

That concludes the conference call for today.

Thank you for joining.

 

You may disconnect.","


Travis Axelrod

Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2024 Q&A Webcast.

 

My name is Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations and I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives.

Our Q2 results were announced at about 3.00 p.m.

 

Central Time and the Update Deck we published at the same link as this webcast.

During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.

 

These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.

Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.

 

During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.

Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.

 

Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.

Elon?

 



Elon Musk

Thank you.

 

So to recap, we saw large adoption exploration in EVs, and then a bit of a hangover as others struggle to make compelling EVs.

So there are quite a few competing electric vehicles that have entered the market.

 

And mostly they’ve not done well, but they’ve discounted their EVs very substantially, which has made it a bit more difficult for Tesla.

We don’t see this as long-term issue, but really -- fairly short-term.

 

And we still obviously firmly believe that EVs are best for customers and that the world is headed for a fully electrified transport, not just the cars, but also aircrafts and boats.

Despite many challenges the Tesla team did a great job executing and we did achieve record quarterly revenues.

 

Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q2, leading to record profits for the energy business.

And we are investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure to support future products.

 

We won't get too much into the product roadmap here, because that is reserved for product announcement events.

But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year.

 

The big -- really by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy.

In addition to that, we've scale economies and we're the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world.

 

So, this, anyway -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotic stack, we are pursuing all of them.

This allows for better cost control, more scale, quicker time to market, and a superior product, applying not to -- not just to autonomous vehicles, but to autonomous humanoid robots like Optimus.

 

Regarding Full Self-Driving and Robotaxi, we've made a lot of progress with Full Self-Driving in Q2 and with version 12.5 beginning rollout, we think customers will experience a step change improvement in how well supervised full self-driving works.

Version 12.5 has 5x the parameters of 12.4 and will finally merge the highway and city stacks.

 

So the highway stack is still at this point is pretty old.

So often the issues people encounter are on highway, but with 12.5, we are finally merged the two stacks.

 

I still find that most people actually don't know how good the system is, and I would encourage anyone to understand the system better, to simply try it out and let the car drive you around.

One of the things we're going to be doing just to make sure people actually understand the capabilities of the car is when delivering a new car and when picking up a car for service to just show people how to use it and just drive them around the block.

 

Once people use it at all they tend to continue using it.

So it's very compelling.

 

And then this I think will be a massive demand driver, even unsupervised full self-driving will be a massive demand driver.

And as we increase the miles between intervention, it will transition from supervised full self-driving to unsupervised full self-driving, and we can unlock massive potential in [V3] (ph).

 

We postponed the sort of Robotaxi the sort of product unveil by a couple of months where it were -- it shifted to 10/10 to the 10th October -end because I wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle -- sort of Robotaxi, the thing that we are -- the main thing that we are going to show and we are also going to show off a couple of other things.

So moving it back a few months allowed us to improve the Robotaxi as well as add in a couple other things for the product unveil.

 

We're also nearing completion of the South expansion of Giga Texas, which will house our largest training cluster to date.

So it will be an incremental for 50,000 H100s plus 20,000 of our hardware 4 AI5 Tesla AI computer.

 

With Optimus, Optimus is already performing tasks in our factory.

And we expect to have Optimus production Version 1 in limited production starting early next year.

 

This will be for Tesla consumption.

It's just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves.

 

But we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in the Tesla factories.

And then in 2026, ramping up production quite a bit, and at that point we'll be providing Optimus robots to outside customers.

 

That will be Production Version 2 of Optimus.

For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.

 

This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.

So we are ramping up production in our U.S.

 

factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.

So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.

 

We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.

The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.

 

I really just can't emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.

Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.

 

And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.

ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $5 trillion, I think they are probably not wrong.

 

And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number.

I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking forward to exciting years ahead.

 



Travis Axelrod

Great.

 

Thank you very much, Elon, and Vaibhav has opening remarks as well.



Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks.

 

As Elon mentioned, the Tesla team rose to the occasion yet again and delivered on all fronts with some notable records.

In addition to those records, we saw our automotive deliveries go sequentially.

 

I would like to thank the entire Tesla team for their efforts in delivering a great quarter.

On the auto business front, affordability remains a top of mind for customers, and in response in Q2, we offered attractive financing options to offset sustained high interest rates.

 

These programs had an impact on revenue per unit in the quarter.

These impacts will persist into Q3 as we have already launched similar programs.

 

We are now offering extremely competitive financing rates in most parts of the world.

This is the best time to buy a Tesla, I mean, if you are waiting on the sidelines, come out and get your car.

 

We had a record quarter on regulatory credits, revenues, and as well.

On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially.

 

It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations.

We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.

 

As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.

We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than 300 miles on a single charge.

 

We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range anxiety.

Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we've seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.

 

Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.

While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such reductions would show up in the P&L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.

 

Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping Cybertruck and Model 3 and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished goods.

While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the near-term.

 

We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was laid over time is bearing the expected results.

Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting in record revenues and profit for the energy business.

 

Energy storage backlog is strong.

As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and others seeing a decline.

 

Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction activities.

Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.

 

The impact of our recent reorg is reflected in restructuring other - on the income statement.

Just to level set, this was about $622 million of charge, which got recorded in the period.

 

And I want people to remember that we've called it out separately on the financials.

Sequentially, our operating expenses excluding surcharges reduced despite an increase in spend for AI-related activities and higher legal and other costs.

 

On the CapEx front, while we saw a sequential decline in Q2, we still expect the year to be over $10 billion in CapEx as we increase our spend to bring a 50k GPU cluster online.

This new cluster will immensely increase our capabilities to scale FSD and other AI initiatives.

 

We reverted to positive free cash flow of $1.3 billion in Q2.

This was despite restructuring payments being made in the quarter and we ended the quarter with over $30 billion of cash and investments.

 

Once again, we've begun the journey towards the next phase for the company with the building blocks being placed.

It will take some time, but will be a rewarding experience for everyone involved.

 

Once again, I would like to thank the entire Tesla team for their efforts.



A - Travis Axelrod

Great.

 

Thank you very much, Vaibhav.

Now let's go to investor questions.

 

The first question is, what is the status on the Roadster?



Elon Musk

With respect to Roadster, we've completed most of the engineering.

 

And I think there's still some upgrades we want to make to it, but we expect to be in production with Roadster next year.

It will be something special, like the whole thing [Indiscernible].

 



Travis Axelrod

Fantastic.

 

The next question is about timing of Robotaxi event, which we've already covered.

So we'll go to the next question, when do you expect the first Robotaxi ride?

 



Elon Musk

I guess that, that's really just a question of when can we expect the first -- or when can we do unsupervised full self-driving.

 

It's difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.

So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high enough that -- to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year.

 

I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.

So next year seems highly probable to me based on [quite simply] (ph) plus the points of the curve of miles between intervention.

 

That trend exceeds humans for sure next year, so yes.



Travis Axelrod

Thank you very much.

 

Our third question is, the Cybertruck is an iconic product that wows everyone who sees it.

Do you have plans to expand the cyber vehicle lineup to a cyber SUV or cyber van?

 



Elon Musk

I think we want to limit product announcements to when we have a special -- specific product announcement event, rather than earnings calls.

 



Travis Axelrod

Great, thank you.

 

Our next question is, what is the current status of 4680 battery cell production and how is the ramp up progressing?



Lars Moravy

Yes, 4680 production ramped strongly in Q2, delivering 51% more cells than Q1 while reducing COGS significantly.

 

We currently produce more than 1,400 Cybertrucks of 4680 cells per week, and we'll continue to ramp output as we drive cost down further towards the cost parity target we set for the end of the year.

We've built our first validation Cybertruck with dry cathode process made on our mass production equipment, which is a huge technical milestone and we're super proud of that.

 

We're on track for production launch with dry cathode in Q4, and this will enable cell cost to be significantly below available alternatives, which was the original goal of the 4680 program.



Travis Axelrod

Great.

 

Thank you very much.

The next question is any update on Dojo?

 



Elon Musk

Yes, so Dojo, I should preface this by saying I'm incredibly impressed by NVIDIA's execution and the capability of their hardware.

 

And what we are seeing is that the demand for NVIDIA hardware is so high that it's often difficult to get the GPUs.

And there just seems this, I guess I'm quite concerned about actually being able to get state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPUs when we want them.

 

And I think this therefore requires that we put a lot more effort on Dojo in order to have -- in order to ensure that we've got the training capability that we need.

So we are going to double down on Dojo, and we do see a path to being competitive with NVIDIA with Dojo.

 

And I think we kind of have no choice because the demand for NVIDIA is so high and the -- it's obviously their obligation essentially to raise the price of GPUs to whatever the market will bear, which is very high.

So, I think we've really got to make Dojo work and we will.

 



Travis Axelrod

Right.

 

The next question is what type of accessories will be offered with Optimus?



Elon Musk

There's -- Optimus is intended to be a generalized humanoid robot with a lot of intelligence.

 

So it's like saying what kind of accessories will be offered with a human.

It's just really intended to be able to be backward compatible with human tasks.

 

So it would use any accessories that a human would use.

Yes.

 



Travis Axelrod

Thank you.

 

The next question is, do you feel you're cheating people out of the joys of owning a Tesla by not advertising?



Elon Musk

We are doing some advertising, so, want to say something?

 



Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, I would say something.

 

Our fundamental belief is that we need to be providing the best products at a reasonable price to the consumers.

Just to give you a fact, in U.S.

 

alone in Q2, over two-thirds of our sales were to -- deliveries were to people who had never owned a Tesla before and which is encouraging.

We've spent money on advertising and other awareness programs and we have adjusted our strategy.

 

We're not saying no to advertising, but this is a dynamic play and we know that we have not exhausted all our options and therefore plan to keep adjusting, but in the latter half of this year as well.



Travis Axelrod

Great.

 

Thank you very much.

The next question is on energy growth, which we already covered in opening remarks, so we'll move on to the next one.

 

What is the updated timeline for Giga Mexico and what will be the primary vehicles produced initially?



Elon Musk

Well, we currently are paused on Giga Mexico.

 

I think we need to see just where things stand after the election.

Trump has said that he will put heavy tariffs on vehicles produced in Mexico.

 

So it doesn't make sense to invest a lot in Mexico if that is going to be the case.

So we kind of need to see where the things play out politically.

 

However, we are increasing capacity at our existing factories quite significantly.

And I should say that the Cybertaxi or Robotaxi will be produced here at our headquarters at Giga Texas.

 



Travis Axelrod

All right.

 

Thank you.



Elon Musk

And as well Optimus towards the end of next year for Optimus production Version 2, the high volume version of Optimus will also be produced here in Texas.

 



Travis Axelrod

Great.

 

Thank you.

Just a couple more.

 

Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license FSD?



Elon Musk

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving.

 

And I suspect there will be more over time.

But we can't comment on the details of those discussions.

 



Travis Axelrod

All right.

 

Thank you.

And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?

 



Elon Musk

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.

 

It's been actually helpful in advancing full self-driving and in building up the new Tesla data center.

With -- regarding investing in xAI, I think, we need to have a shareholder approval of any such investment.

 

But I'm certainly supportive of that if shareholders are, the group -- probably, I think we need a vote on that.

And I think there are opportunities to integrate Grok into Tesla's software, yes.

 



Travis Axelrod

All right.

 

Thanks very much.

And now we will move on to analyst questions.

 

The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist.

Will, please go ahead and unmute yourself.

 



Will Stein

Great.

 

Thanks so much for taking my question.

And this relates a little bit to the last one that was asked.

 

Elon, I share your strong enthusiasm about AI and I recognize Tesla's opportunity to do some great things with the technology.

But there are some concerns I have about Tesla's commercialization and that's what I'd like to ask about specifically.

 

There were some news stories through the quarter that indicated that you redirected some AI compute systems that were destined for Tesla instead to xAI or perhaps it was to X, I'm not sure.

And similarly, a few quarters ago, if you recall, I asked about your ability to hire engineers in this area, and you noted that there was a great desire for some of these engineers to work on projects that you were involved with, but some of them weren't at Tesla, they were instead at xAI or perhaps even X again.

 

So the question is, when it comes to your capital investments, your AI R&D, your AI engineers, how do you make allocation decisions among these various ventures and how do you make Tesla owners comfortable that you're doing it in a way that really benefits them?

Thank you.

 



Elon Musk

Yes, I mean, I think you're referring to a very -- like an old article, regarding GPUs.

 

I think that's like 6 or 7 months old.

At Tesla, we had no place to try them on, so it would've been a waste of Tesla capital because we would just have to order H100 and have no place to try them on.

 

So it was just -- there was -- this wasn't a, let's pick xAI of Tesla.

There's -- there was no -- the Tesla data centers were full.

 

There was no place to actually put them.

The -- we've been working 24/7 to complete the South extension on the Tesla Giga factory in Texas.

 

That South extension is what will house 50,000 H100s and we're beginning to move the H100 server racks into place there.

But we really needed -- we needed that to complete physically.

 

You can't just order compute -- order GPUs and turn them on, you need a data center, it's not possible.

So I want to be clear, that was in Tesla's interest, not contrary to Tesla's interest.

 

Does Tesla no good to have GPUs that it can't turn on.

That South extension is able to take GPUs, which is really just this week.

 

We are moving the GPUs in there and we'll bring them online.

With regard to xAI, there are a few that only want to work on AGI.

 

So what I was finding was that when trying to recruit people to Tesla, they were only interested in working on AGI and not on Tesla's specific problems and they want to start -- do a start-up.

So it was a case of either they go to a start-up or -- and I am involved or they do a start-up and I am not involved.

 

Those are the two choices.

This wasn't they would come to Tesla.

 

They were not going to come to Tesla under any circumstances.

So, yes.

 



Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, I mean, I would even add that AI is a broad spectrum and there are a lot of things which we are focused on full time driving as Tesla and also Optimus, but there's the other spectrum of AI which we're not working on, and that's the kind of work which other companies are trying to do in this case, xAI.

 

So you have to keep that in mind that it's a broad spectrum.

It's not just one specific thing.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

And once again, I want to just repeat myself here.

I tried to recruit them to Tesla, including to say like, you can work on AGI, I if you want and they refused.

 

Only then was xAI created.



Will Stein

I really appreciate that clarification.

 

If I can ask one follow-up, it relates to the new vehicles that you're planning to introduce next year.

I understand this is not the venue for product announcements, but when we think about the focus, I've heard on the one hand that the focus is on cost reduction.

 

On the other hand, you also said that the Roadster would come out.

Should we expect other maybe more limited variants like, similar to the cars that you make today, but with some changes or improvements or different, some other variability in the form factors.

 

It should -- we expect that to be a significant part of the strategy in the next year or two?



Elon Musk

I don't want to get into details of product announcements.

 

And we have to be careful of the Osborne effect here.

So, if you start announcing some great thing, it affects our near-term sales.

 

We're going to make great products in future just like we have in the past, end of story.



Travis Axelrod

Right.

 

The next question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird.

Ben, please go ahead and unmute yourself.

 



Ben Kallo

Hi.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

When we think about revenue contribution and with energy growing so quickly and Optimus on the come, how do we think about the overall segments longer term?

 

And then do you think that auto revenue will fall below 50% of your overall revenue?

And then my follow-up is just on the last call you talked about, distributed compute on your new hardware.

 

Could you just update us and talk a little bit more about that, the timeline for it and how you would reward customers for letting you use their compute power and their cars?

Thanks.

 



Elon Musk

Yes, I mean, as I've said a few times, I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else that Tesla combined.

 

So, it's simply -- just simply consider the usefulness utility of a humanoid robot that can do pretty much anything you ask of it.

I think everyone on earth is going to want one.

 

There's 8 billion people on earth, so it's 8 billion right there.

Then you've got, all of the industrial uses, which is probably at least as much, if not way more.

 

So I suspect that the long-term demand for general purpose humanoid robots is in excess of 20 billion units.

And Tesla is -- that has the most advanced humanoid robot in the world, and is also very good at manufacturing, which these other companies are not.

 

And we've got a lot of experience -- with the most experienced with the world leaders in real world AI.

So we have all of the ingredients.

 

I think we are unique in having all of the ingredients necessary for large scale, high utility, generalized humanoid robots.

That's why my rough estimate long-term is in accordance with the ARK [ph] Invest analysis of market cap on the order of $5 trillion for -- maybe more for autonomous transport, and it's several times that number for general purpose humanoid robots.

 

I mean, at that point, I'm not sure what money even means, but in the benign AI scenario, we are headed for an age of abundance where there is no shortage of goods and services.

Anyone can have pretty much anything they want.

 

It's a wild -- very wild future we're heading for.



Ben Kallo

On the distributed compute?

 



Elon Musk

Yes, distributed compute, that seems like a pretty obvious thing to do.

 

I think the -- where this distributed compute becomes interesting is with our next generation Tesla AI truck, which is hardware viable or what we're calling AI5, which is -- from the standpoint of inference capability comparable toB200 -- and a bit of B200.

And we are aiming to have that in production at the end of next year and scale production in '26.

 

So it just seemed like if you've got -- even if you've got autonomous vehicles that are operating for 50 or 60 hours a week, there's a 168 hours in a week.

So you have somewhere above I think a 100 [indiscernible] net computing.

 

I think we need a better word than GPU because GPU means graph express in unit.

So there's a 100 hours plus per week of AI compute, AI advanced compute from the fleet, from the vehicles and probably some percentage from the humanoid robots that it would make sense to do distributed inference.

 

And if you're -- if there's a fleet of at some point a 100 million vehicles with AI5 and beyond, because you have AI 6 and 7 and whatnot, and there may be billions of humanoid robots that is just a staggering amount of inference compute or that could be used for general purposes at computing.

It doesn't have to be used for, the humanoid robot or for the car.

 

So I think, that's just -- that -- that's a pretty obvious thing to say, like, well, it's more useful than having to do nothing.



Travis Axelrod

All right.

 

Thank you.

The next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Alex.

 

Alex, please go ahead and unmute yourself.



Alex Potter

Perfect.

 

Thanks.

I wanted to ask a question on FSD licensing.

 

You mentioned that in passing previously, was just wondering if you can elaborate maybe on the mechanics of how that would work.

I guess presumably this would not be some sort of simple plug and play proposition that presumably an OEM would need, I don't know, several years to develop its own vehicle platform that's based on FSD.

 

I imagine they would need to adopt Tesla's electrical architecture, compute, sensor stack.

So I, correct me if I'm sort of misunderstanding this, but if you had a cooperative agreement of some kind with another OEM, then presumably it would take you several years before you'd be able to recognize licensing revenue from that agreement.

 

Is that the right way to think about that?



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

The OEMs not real fast.

There's not really a sensor suite, it's just cameras.

 

But they would have to integrate our AI computer and have cameras with a 360 degree view.

And at least the gateway, like the what talks to the internet, and communicates with the Tesla system, what that you need kind of a gateway computer too.

 

So it's really gateway computer with the cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity, the Tesla AI computer, and seven cameras, or not cameras, again, a 360 degree view.

But this will -- given the speed at which, the auto industry moves, it would be several years before you would see this in volume.

 



Alex Potter

Okay, good.

 

That's more or less what I expected.

So then the follow-up here is, if you did sign an FSD licensing agreement with another automaker, when do you think you would disclose that?

 

Would you do it right when you signed the agreement or only after that multiple years has passed and the vehicle is ready to be rolled out?

think it depends on the OEM.

 

I guess we'd be happy either way.

Yes, it depends on, what kind of arrangement we enter into.

 

A lot of those things are, we are not resolved yet, so we'll make that determination as and when we get to that point.



Elon Musk

And the kind of deals that are obviously relevant are only if, some OEM is willing to do this in a million cars a year or something significant.

 

It's not -- if it's like 10,000 or a 100,000 cars a year.

We can just make that ourselves.

 



Travis Axelrod

All right, thank you.

 

The next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays.

Dan, please go ahead and unmute yourself.

 



Dan Levy

Hi, good evening.

 

Thanks for taking the questions.

First, wanted to start with a question on Shanghai.

 

You've leveraged Shanghai as an export center really due its low cost, and that makes sense.

But maybe you can just give us a sense of, of how the strategy changes, if at all, given, the implementation of tariffs in Europe.

 

Also to what extent, your import of batteries from China into the U.S., how that might change given the tariffs.

Thank you.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

I think I covered some part of it in my opening remarks, but just to give you a little bit more, just on the tariff side, the European authorities did sample certain other OEMs in the first round to establish the tariffs for cars being imported from China into Europe.

While we were not picked up in our individual examination in the first round, they did pick us up in the second round.

 

They visited our factory.

They -- we worked with them, provided them all the information.

 

As a result, we were adjusting our import strategy out of China into Europe.

But -- and one other thing to note is in Q2 itself, we started building right hand from model wise out of Berlin and we also delivered it in U.K.

 

And we're adjusting as needed, but we will keep adjust.

We're still importing Model 3s into Europe, out of Shanghai.

 

And we are still evaluating what is the best alternate manage all this just on the examination by the European authorities.

Like I said, we cooperated with them.

 

Well, we are confident that they, we should get a better rate than what they have imposed for now.

But this is literally evolving and we are adjusting as fast as we can with this.

 

It is -- I would also add that, because of this, you've seen the impact that Berlin is doing more imports into places like Taiwan as well as, U.K I just mentioned.

So it will keep changing and we will keep adapting as we go about it.

 



Dan Levy

Great.

 

Thanks.

Yes, thank you.

 

As a follow-up, wanted to ask about the Robotaxi strategy and specifically the shareholder deck here notes that the release is going to be -- one of the gating factors is regulatory approval.

So maybe you could help us understand which regulations specifically are the ones that we should be looking for?

 

Is it FMVSS, that's standard?

And then to what extent does the strategy shift?

 

You've done with FSD more of a nationwide, no boundary approach.

Is the Robotaxi approach one that's more geofenced, so to speak, and is more driven by a state by state approach?

 



Elon Musk

I mean, our solution is a generalized solution like what everybody else has.

 

They, if you see like Waymo has one of it, they have a very localized solution that requires high density mapping.

It's not -- it's quite fragile.

 

So, their ability to expand rapidly is limited.

Our solution is a general solution that works anywhere.

 

It would even work on a different earth.

So if you're rendered a new Earth, it would work on a new earth.

 

So it's -- there's this capability I think in our experience, once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or significantly safer than human.

We are fine that regulators are supportive of deploying deployment of that capability.

 

It's difficult to argue with if you -- if you've got a large number of -- yes, if you've got billions of miles that show that in the future unsupervised FSD is safer than human.

What regulator could really stand in the way of that?

 

They would -- they're morally obligated to approve.

So I don't think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor.

 

I should also say that the self-driving capabilities of this are deployed outside of North America are far behind that in, in North America.

So with the -- with Version 12.5, and maybe a 12.6, but pretty soon we will ask for regular regulatory approval of the Tesla supervised FSD in Europe, China, and other countries.

 

And I, I think we're likely to receive that before the end of the year, which will be a helpful demand driver in those regions obviously.



Travis Axelrod

Thank you.

 

Just to …



Elon Musk

Go ahead, Travis.

 



Travis Axelrod

In terms of like, as Elon said, in terms of regulatory approval, the vehicles are governed by FMVSS in U.S., which is the same across all 50 states.

 

The road rules are the same across all 50 states.

So creating a generalized solution gives us the best opportunity to deploy in all 50 states, reasonably.

 

Of course there are state and even local and municipal level regulations that may apply to, being a transportation company or deploying taxes.

But as far as getting the vehicle on the road, that's all federal and that's very much in line with what you was just suggesting about the data and the vehicle itself.

 



Vaibhav Taneja

And to add to the technology point, the end-to-end network basically makes no assumption about the location.

 

Like you could add data from different countries and it just like perform equally well there, just like almost like close to zero US specific, um, code in there.

It's all just the data that comes from the U.S

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

To, to that end of the show, it's like, we can go as humans to other countries and drive with some reasonable amount of assessment in those countries.

And that's how you design the FSC software.

 

Yes, exactly.



Travis Axelrod

Great.

 

Thanks guys.

The next question comes from George from Canaccord.

 

George, please go ahead and unmute yourself.



George Gianarikas

Hi, everyone.

 

Thank you for taking my questions.

Maybe just to expand on the regulatory question for a second.

 

And I could be comparing apples and oranges, but GM canceled their pedal less, wheel less vehicle.

And according to the company this morning, their decision was driven by uncertainty about the regulatory environment.

 

And from what we understand, and again, maybe I'm wrong here, but the Robotaxi that has been shown at least in images of the public is also pedal less and wheel less.

Is there a different regulatory concern just if you deploy a vehicle like that that doesn't have pedal -- pedals or a wheel, and that may not be different from just regular FSD on a traditional Tesla vehicle.

 

Thank you.



Elon Musk

Well, obviously the real reason that they cancel it is because GM can't make it work, not because the regulators, they're blaming regulators.

 

That's misleading of them to do so, because Waymo is doing just fine in those markets.

So it's just that their technology is not far.

 



George Gianarikas

Right.

 

And maybe just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned, that FSD take rates were up materially after you reduced the price.

Is there any way you can help us quantify what that means Exactly?

 

Thank you.



Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, we shared the [indiscernible] that there we've seen a meaningful increase.

 

I don't want to get into specific because we started from a low base and -- but we are seeing encouraging results.

And the key thing here is, like Elon said, you need to experience it because words can't describe it till the time we actually use it.

 

And that's why we are trying to make sure that every time a car is getting delivered, people are being showed how this thing is working because when you see it working, you realize how great it is.

I mean, just to give you one example, so again, there's a bias example, but I have a more than 20 mile commute into the factory almost every day.

 

I have zero interventions on the latest stack, and the card just literally drives me over.

And especially with the latest version wherein, we are also tracking your eye movement, the steering wheel lag is almost not there as long as you're not wearing sunglasses.

 



Elon Musk

Well, we are fixing the sunglasses thing.

 

It's coming soon.

So you will be able to drive -- you'll be able to have sunglasses on and have the car drive.

 



George Gianarikas

Yes.

 



Elon Musk

So -- but there's number of times I've talked with smart people who like live in New York or maybe downtown Boston and don't ever drive and then ask me about FSD, I'm like, you can just get a car and try it.

 

And if you're not doing that, you have no idea what's going on.



Travis Axelrod

Thank you.

 

The next question comes from Pierre from New Street.

Pierre, please unmute yourself.

 



Ferragu Pierre

Hey, guys.

 

Thank you for taking my question.

So it's on Robotaxi again, and I completely get it that with a universal solution, we will get like regulatory approval, we'll get there eventually clicking up miles and compute, et cetera.

 

And my question is more, how you think about deployments, because I'm still like, I'm thinking once you have a car that can drive everywhere, that can replace me, it can replace a taxi, but then to do the right hailing service, you need a certain scale.

And that means a lot of cars on the road and so you need an infrastructure to just maintain the cars, take care of them, et cetera.

 

And so my question is, are you already working on that?

Do you have already an idea of what, like your plan to deploy looks like?

 

And is that like a test Tesla only plan or are you looking at partners, local partners, global partners to do that?

And I'll have a quick follow-up.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

This would just be the Tesla network.

You just literally open the Tesla app and summon a car and resend a car to pick you up and take you somewhere.

 

And you can -- our -- we'll have a fleet that's I don't know, on order of 7 million dedicated global autonomy soon.

In the years come it'll be over 10 million, then over 20 million.

 

This is immense scale.

And the car is able to operate 24/7, unlike the human driver.

 

So, the capability to -- like, if there's this basically instant scale with a software update.

And now this is for a customer on fleet.

 

So you can think of that as being a bit like Airbnb, like you can choose to allow your car to be used by the fleet, or cancel that and bring it back.

It can be used by the fleet all the time.

 

It can be used by the fleet some of the time, and then Tesla would take -- would share on the revenue with the customer.

But you can think of the giant fleet of Tesla vehicles as like a giant sort of Airbnb equivalent fleet, Airbnb on wheels.

 

The -- I mean, then in addition we would make some number of cars for Tesla that would just be owned by Tesla and be added to the fleet.

I guess that would be a bit more like Uber.

 

But this would all be a Tesla network.

And there's an important clause we've put in, in every Tesla purchase, which is that the Tesla vehicles can only be used in the Tesla fleet.

 

They cannot be used by a third-party for autonomy.



Ferragu Pierre

Okay.

 

And do you think that scale is like progressively so you can start in a city with just a handful of cars and you grow the number of cars over time?

Or do you think there is like a critical mass you need to get to, to be able to offer like a service that is of competitive quality compared to what like the -- like Uber would be typically delivering already?

 



Elon Musk

I guess I'm not -- maybe I'm not conveying this correctly.

 

The entire Tesla fleet basically becomes active.

This is obviously maybe there's some number of people who don't want their car to own money, but I think most people will.

 

It's instant scale.



Travis Axelrod

Thank you.

 

Our next question comes from Colin from Oppenheimer.

Colin, please unmute yourself.

 



Colin Rusch

Sorry about that guys.

 

I've got two questions around energy storage.

With the tight supply and the stationary storage, can you talk about your pricing strategy and how you're thinking about saturation and given geographies given that some of these larger systems are starting to shift wholesale power markets in a pretty meaningful way quickly?

 



Vaibhav Taneja

So, I mean, we are working with a large set of players in the market and our pipeline is actually pretty long.

 

And there's actually very -- there's actually long end in terms of where you enter into a contract where delivery started -- starts happening.

And so far we have good pricing leverage.

 

And now Mike, chime in on this too.



Unidentified Company Representative

Yes, I mean there's a lot of competition from Chinese OEMs just like there is in the vehicle space.

 

So we're in close contact with our customers and making sure that we're remaining competitive in where they're needing to be competitive to, to secure contracts to sell power and energy in the markets.

We had a really strong contracting quarter and continue to build our backlog for 2025 and 2026.

 

So we feel pretty good about where we are in the market.

We realize that competition is strong, but we have a pretty strong value proposition with offering a fully integrated product with our own power electronics and site level controls.

 

So …



Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, and again, the aspect which people miss do not fully understand is that there's also a whole software stack, which comes with from Megapack, right?

 

And that is a unique proposition which we -- which is only available to us, and we are using it with other stuff too, but that gives us a much more of an edge as compared to the competition.



Elon Musk

Yes, we find customers that they can sort of put together a hodgepodge solution.

 

And so, and then sometimes they'll pick that solution, and then that doesn't work.

And then they come back to us.

 



Unidentified Company Representative

Yes, and we're not really seeing saturation for like, on a global scale.

 

There's little pockets of saturation in different markets, but we're more seeing that there's markets opening up given demand on the grid just continues to increase more than anyone expects.

So that just opens up markets, really across the world in different pockets.

 



Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, I mean just even on the AI computer side, right?

 

These GPUs are really powerful already and the amount of new pipeline, which we're getting for people for data center backup and things like that is increasing at a pretty large scale.



Colin Rusch

Yes.

 

Thanks.

And then the follow-up here is 4680 process technology and the role to role process.

 

There's some news around your equipment suppliers.

Can you talk about how far along you are in, in potentially qualifying an incremental supplier around some of that, those critical process technology steps?

 



Lars Moravy

Yes, I can talk about that.

 

As you're probably referring to the lawsuit that we have with one of our suppliers, look, I don't think this is going to affect our ability to roll out 4680.

We have very strong IP position in the technology and the majority of the equipment that we use is in-house designed and some of it's in-house build.

 

And so we can take our IP stack and have someone else build it if we need to.

So it's, that's not really a concern right now.

 



Elon Musk

Yes.

 

I, I think people don't understand just how much demand there will be for grid storage.

They really just like the [indiscernible] I think are underestimating this demand by probably orders magnitude.

 

So that the actual energy, total energy output of, say the U.S grid is if the power plants can operate a steady state is at least two to three times, the amount of energy it currently produces, because there are a huge gap.

There's a huge difference in the -- from peak to trough in terms of energy of power generation.

 

So in order for a grid to not have blackouts, it must be able to support the load at the worst minute of the worst day of the year, the coldest or hottest day, which means that for the rest of the time, the rest of the year, it's got massive excess power generation capability, but it has no way to store that energy.

Once you add battery packs, you can now run the power plants at steady state.

 

Steady state means that basically any given grid anywhere in the world can produce in terms of cumulative energy in the course of the year, at least twice what it is currently producing in some cases, maybe three times.



Travis Axelrod

All right.

 

Thank you, Elon.

The next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.

 

Colin, please unmute yourself.



Colin Langan

Oh, great.

 

Thanks for taking my questions.

Do you hear me?

 



Travis Axelrod

Yes.

 



Colin Langan

Yes.

 

Sorry.

I guess when we are going to ask, if Trump wins, there's a higher chance that IRA could get cut.

 

I think Elon, you had commented online that Tesla doesn't survive on EV subsidies.

But when Tesla lose a lot of support if IRA goes away?

 

I think model Y3 and Y get IRA help for customers, and I think your batteries get production tax credits.

So, just one, can you clarify if the end, if IRA ends, would it be a negative for your profitability in the near-term?

 

Why might it not be a negative?

And then, any framing of the current support you get, IRA-related?

 



Elon Musk

I guess that there would be like some impact, but I think it would be devastating for our competitors.

 

But -- and it would hurt Tesla slightly.

But long-term probably actually helps Tesla would be my guess.

 

Yes -- but I've said this before on earnings calls, it -- the value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy.

These other things are in the noise relative to autonomy.

 

So I recommend anyone who doesn't believe that Tesla will solve vehicle autonomy should not hold Tesla stock.

They should sell their Tesla stock.

 

You should believe Tesla will solve autonomy, you should buy Tesla stock.

And all these other questions are in the noise.

 



Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, I mean, I'll add this just to clarify a few things that -- at the end of the day, when we are looking at our business, we've always been looking at it whether or not IRA is there and we want our business to grow healthy without having any subsidies coming in, whichever way you look at it.

 

And that's the way we have always modeled everything.

And that is the way internally also even when we are looking at battery costs, yes, I --, there are manufacturing credits which we get, but we always drive ourselves to say, okay, what if there is no higher benefit and how do we operate in that kind of an environment?

 

And like Elon said, we definitely have a big advantage as compared to a competition on that front.

We've delivered it and you can see it in the numbers over the years.

 

Like, so there is you cannot ignore the fundamental size of the business.

And then on top of it, once you add autonomy to it, like even said, it becomes meaningless to you think about the short-term.

 



Travis Axelrod

Okay.

 

I think that's unfortunately all the time we have for today.

We appreciate all of your questions.

 

We look forward to talking to you next quarter.

Thank you very much and goodbye.

 



Elon Musk

That's excellent.

 ","Operator

Good morning and welcome to PayPal's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

 

My name is Sarah and I'll be your conference operator today.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

 

I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, PayPal's Chief Investor Relations Officer.

Please go ahead.

 



Steve Winoker 

Thanks, Sarah.

 

Welcome to PayPal's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.

I'm joined by President and CEO, Alex Chriss and CFO, Jamie Miller.

 

Our remarks today include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Actual results may differ materially from these statements.

 

Our commentary is based on our best view of the world and our businesses, as we see them today.

As described in our earnings press release, SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes.

 

Now over to you, Alex.



Alex Chriss 

Thank you, Steve.

 

And thanks to everyone for joining us this morning.

PayPal delivered a strong second quarter and first half with encouraging operating and financial results.

 

While change takes time and we still have much work ahead of us, we are well positioned today, have the right leadership in place, and are moving full steam ahead.

I'm confident we are on the right track in making meaningful progress on our transformation to position PayPal for long-term, durable and profitable growth.

 

Looking at our results in the second quarter, total payment volume rose 11% to $417 billion, and we delivered 9% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis.

Transaction margin dollars grew 8%, representing our best performance on that metric since 2021.

 

Our non-GAAP earnings per share increased 36% year-over-year.

We're encouraged to see not only the strength and stability in PayPal's platform, but also early contributions from some of the initiatives we have underway.

 

Branded checkout continues to grow profitably.

Braintree is now meaningfully contributing to transaction margin dollar growth for the first time in over two years.

 

Venmo momentum continues to build and monthly active accounts increased across both PayPal and Venmo.

Given the strength across PayPal, we are raising our full year guidance for growth in transaction margin dollars and earnings per share, and increasing our investment in strategic growth initiatives that we are driving.

 

Overall, we remain on course with the strategy we set at the beginning of the year.

Our teams are moving with urgency, excited about our innovation, and focused on execution.

 

We are still early in our transformation, and while pleased with our progress in many areas, we know there is much more we can do and with greater speed.

For example, mobile experiences, SMB, and Venmo are places we are working hard to improve, and we are continuing to identify ways to operate more effectively and efficiently.

 

I want to spend a moment discussing how PayPal stands apart, as a strategic commerce partner.

In the past two quarters, we have talked at length about the experience upgrades we are bringing to branded checkout.

 

However, I do not want to lose sight of what makes PayPal truly differentiated, our two-sided network of hundreds of millions of consumers and merchants worldwide.

We are building an end-to-end platform, spanning the full commerce journey with superior customer experiences and sales conversion from start to finish.

 

PayPal is one of the only players with both sides of the network, consumer and merchant at scale globally and with the infrastructure to support it.

That is incredibly hard to replicate and a powerful foundation on which to launch new innovations including Fastlane and the Ads platform that we are in the early stages of building.

 

The data insights and compounding network effects, give us an incredible advantage that we are now just beginning to harness fully.

Today, we operate in a massive $6 trillion plus global e-commerce market that benefits from the ongoing digitization of payments and commerce in new contexts.

 

These tailwinds, combined with the initiatives we are now executing, such as building more omnichannel capabilities and offering more value-added services for consumers and merchants, will expand our addressable market and provide PayPal with significant opportunity for long-term growth.

Over the last year, we've been working to transform our global business from a series of products and services into a multi-faceted, omni-channel, and open platform capable of generating value in multiple ways throughout the commerce ecosystem.

 

We are building a platform that delivers far more value to our customers and partners than the individual products we offer.

This is a key differentiator for PayPal and will expand our market opportunity over time.

 

The initial response to the innovations we are introducing gives us confidence that we will see more consumers and more engagement in more places across our growing network.

That in turn will drive more merchants and higher levels of commitment into our ecosystem.

 

These network effects will be mutually reinforcing, compounding, and add value to the company.

Our peers are taking note, and the value of our platform is being recognized by large tech companies that are seeking to partner with us in a variety of new ways.

 

One great example of this is Meta, which we already partner with on multiple fronts.

PayPal is a top payment method for advertisers and consumers globally across Meta's family of apps.

 

Meta's donations and charitable giving campaigns now run on the PayPal Giving Fund platform.

Meta pays out creators and developers using Hyperwallet, and Meta uses Braintree for credit card processing.

 

We are working closely with Meta to optimize the experiences and look forward to deepening our partnership with Meta in mutually beneficial ways in the months and years ahead.

You will continue to hear about more partnerships with deepening commitments over the coming quarters.

 

Let me update you on our customer-backed business strategies.

We continue to execute with high velocity to enhance customer experiences and value for our large enterprises, SMBs, and consumers.

 

We are building the foundation for our next phase of growth.

For large enterprises, we continue to have a productive conversation to help merchants understand the additional value they can unlock by strengthening their relationship with us to take advantage of our full platform capabilities.

 

For example, we recently renewed our contract with DoorDash to expand how we work together.

Beyond unbranded PSP processing and offering our branded marks, DoorDash also relies on our risk capabilities to mitigate losses.

 

As part of our new agreement, DoorDash has committed as an initial launch partner for our latest branded checkout enhancements that we announced in January.

And they will be participating in our new ads platform.

 

Combining our best-in-class payments platform with value-added services that are margin accretive is helping us create a more profitable dynamic.

Last quarter, I told you we expected to make Fastlane generally available in the US, in the second half of the year.

 

I'm pleased to announce that in August, we are delivering on that commitment and making Fastlane generally available to merchants in the US.

This includes merchants on Braintree and PPCP, as well as through partners, including Salesforce, Adobe, and BigCommerce.

 

While broad adoption will take time, we have heard from many merchants who are excited to add Fastlane and have a robust go-to-market strategy.

As I've shared before, data from our early adopters shows that returning Fastlane users, convert at nearly 80% versus the industry average guest checkout conversion closer to 50%.

 

As our network builds with more merchants and consumers, we expect benefits to scale over time because we will be able to recognize even more shoppers.

The early feedback we've heard from our merchants and sales team gives us increasing confidence that Fastlane will accelerate PayPal's ability to capture the roughly 60% share of e-commerce purchases made without a branded mark.

 

As a reminder, A large part of that 60% is still manual card entry, has low conversion today, and is generally a poor experience for consumers and merchants.

Much of that is now changing with Fastlane.

 

For small and medium-sized businesses, we are continuing to improve our value proposition through the rollout of PPCP.

We continue to make progress migrating volume from legacy platforms onto this new solution, as well as integrating with new partners and merchants.

 

SMB volume on PPCP continues to trend positively, up more than 40% through the first half of the year.

A large portion of that volume is coming from merchants using PayPal as their full stack processor across both branded and unbranded payments.

 

Our efforts here are also important because PPCP ensures merchants have our latest branded checkout integration, which will include Fastlane.

That will give consumers a best-in-class checkout experience wherever they shop and help merchants benefit from higher conversion.

 

On average, merchants who adopt PPCP use more products, which deepens our relationship, reduces churn, and drives higher average revenue per account.

As I said before, this is an area where we are focused, and we have tremendous opportunity to better serve small businesses' end-to-end needs.

 

For consumers, we are focused on extending our leadership in consumer preference, increasing the share of checkout, and driving more frequent engagement from our consumers.

In the second quarter, we launched in-app offers with major brands including Best Buy, Priceline, Lyft, Instacart, Ticketmaster, Walmart, and Nordstrom.

 

We are seeing positive trends in consumer engagement with gross merchandise volume driven by one of our offers nearly tripling in June compared to March.

And while still early days, the initial interest from advertisers is encouraging.

 

As we shared before, you will see us invest in marketing in the back half of the year and beyond to further position PayPal and Venmo as rewarding ways to pay.

I talked previously about our need to improve our branded checkout experiences on mobile devices.

 

That improvement is now happening.

In the first half, we started ramping several designs and technology innovations to our branded checkout flows to improve the experience for our customers.

 

For example, we are launching a new super simple vaulted experience for high repeat use merchants.

In initial tests, the redesigned vaulting payment page alone shows a conversion lift of 75 to 110 basis points.

 

Experiences like this one are clearly resonating with consumers.

And remember that every point of conversion lift, drives significant value for our merchants who are fighting to win every sale.

 

We will be ramping our redesigned branded checkout experiences to all eligible consumers in the US in the coming weeks and months.

As the number one branded mark with the largest network of merchant acceptance, we are a ubiquitous checkout solution.

 

We are continuing to innovate and create high converting experiences on both desktop and mobile and across platforms and devices.

We also continue engaging consumers post purchase with smart receipts, package tracking, push notifications, and more, adding increased value and driving the PayPal engagement flywheel.

 

In fact, we drove almost 20 million app logins from our post-purchase experiences in June alone, growing more than 70% from a year ago.

P2P is an essential acquisition and engagement tool for us, and we are returning it to growth.

 

We suffered declines through 2023, but over the past few quarters we have seen an improvement driven by product enhancements such as new global withdrawal capabilities, better risk decisioning, and more cross-border activity.

We will continue to invest in our experiences, pricing, and marketing to drive enhanced awareness and engagement.

 

Turning to Venmo, we are building on the business’s strong market position.

In the second quarter, Venmo processed more than $73 billion in total payment volume, growing 8% year-over-year.

 

With monthly active, increasing 5% year-over-year, to nearly 62 million.

Both a strong base of peer-to-peer users and adoption of our ecosystem of products are driving this growth.

 

For example, both Venmo debit card and Pay with Venmo monthly actives grew approximately 30%.

In the second quarter, we launched push provisioning of the Venmo debit card to Apple and Google wallets and continued to enable Pay with Venmo with more merchants and partners, including eBay and StubHub, which we expect will continue to fuel this growth.

 

Our recently launched Venmo Teen Accounts is showing encouraging early traction, expanding our addressable market, and helping us build lifelong relationships with customers from an early age.

What excites me most about Venmo is that we are only scratching the surface of its potential, starting to drive customer-led, profitable innovation, and we see substantial headroom for growth.

 

Said simply, Venmo is primed for growth.

Finally, consumers who love PayPal for online purchases are also telling merchants they want to use PayPal for their offline purchases.

 

We continue to drive the adoption of our card products, and we're making it easier to add PayPal and Venmo branded cards to Apple and Google wallets on mobile devices.

We are also looking forward to launching even more ways for consumers to use PayPal anytime, anyplace with NFC technology starting in Europe.

 

Expect to see more from us in the coming quarters to enable and incentivize our customers to use PayPal online and in person.

Reflecting on the quarter and looking ahead, I want to thank the PayPal team for continuing to work tirelessly as we transform our company and give our customers the best possible experiences.

 

With that, over to Jamie.



Jamie Miller 

Thanks Alex.

 

Good morning everyone.

Moving to Slide 6, PayPal delivered strong second quarter results and we are raising our full year guidance.

 

We're passing through the first half performance and increasing second half growth investments as we build confidence in initiatives across the company.

Our goal for 2024 remains the same, to set PayPal up for long-term success by prioritizing investments that will deliver durable, profitable growth.

 

As Alex mentioned, while the second quarter produced another improving set of results, change takes time and can sometimes be uneven.

The success of our transformation will be measured over quarters and years.

 

We have a lot of work ahead but the teams are making progress and building on a strong foundation visible in our first half results.

Looking at the high-level financial results in the second quarter, revenue increased 8% at spot and 9% on a currency-neutral basis.

 

Transaction margin dollars grew 8% year-over-year, a more than 300 basis point improvement from the first quarter.

Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.19, representing 36% year-over-year growth.

 

And relative to our prior expectations, higher earnings per share were driven by a combination of factors, including stronger transaction margin dollar growth and interest income.

Turning to Slide 7, our financial results are a function of the number of customers we have, how engaged they are across our platform, and how frequently they transact with us.

 

Our operating metrics reflect progress on this front.

We ended the second quarter with 429 million total active accounts and 222 million monthly active accounts.

 

Total active accounts increased by nearly 2 million from the first quarter and included growth in PayPal merchant and consumer accounts in addition to other products.

We were encouraged to see sustained total active account growth following a positive inflection in the first quarter.

 

Monthly active accounts continued to show steady progress, up 3% year-over-year to $222 million with contributions from both PayPal consumer accounts and Venmo.

Transactions per active account, which is a trailing 12-month number with 60.9 in the second quarter up 11%.

 

Excluding PSP processing, which is primarily Braintree, transactions per active account grew 6%.

Moving to Slide 8, total payment volume grew 11% on a spot and currency-neutral basis to $417 billion.

 

US TPV grew 11%.

International TPV also grew 11% on a currency neutral basis, primarily driven by strength in continental Europe and Asia.

 

Looking at the breakdown by product, global branded checkout volumes grew 6% on a currency neutral basis in the second quarter.

This was consistent with our first quarter performance, which increased 6%, excluding a one-point benefit from the additional leap day.

 

Within branded checkout, we continue to see strength across large enterprise platforms, marketplaces, and international growth.

We remain laser-focused on driving deeper adoption of our best-in-class solutions with small and medium businesses and improving our mobile experiences, which are critical, particularly in markets like the US.

 

And the UK PSP processing volume grew 19% in the quarter compared to 26% in the first quarter.

Importantly, we are beginning to see the benefit of our shift in strategy to drive profitable growth.

 

Our focus on price to value is having an impact with Braintree now contributing positively to transaction margin dollar growth in a meaningful way.

Moving to more financial detail on slide 9, transaction revenue grew 9% on a spot basis to $7.2 billion driven primarily by Braintree, Branded Checkout, and Venmo.

 

Other value-added services revenue in the quarter was close to flat at $732 million.

Interest on customer balances continued to be a meaningful tailwind to OVAS revenue and contributed approximately 3 points to transaction margin dollar growth in the quarter.

 

Revenue within our credit business declined year-over-year but performed in-line with expectations.

Part of the decline is due to proactive decisions made last year to manage risk and reduce on-balance sheet merchant receivables.

 

We are also seeing ongoing normalization of loss rates within our off-balance sheet US Consumer revolving portfolio.

Overall, we have taken steps over the last year to actively manage the credit portfolio's exposure and are continuing to position the portfolio to move toward a less capital-intensive business model.

 

Transaction take rate declined by 3 basis points to 1.72% compared to a 5 basis point decline last quarter.

PSP Volumes and Venmo benefited transaction take rate, which was offset by faster large enterprise growth within our branded checkout business, foreign exchange fees, and an acceleration in other merchant services, including payouts.

 

Transaction margin dollars increased 8% in the second quarter compared to a 4% increase in the first quarter.

Higher interest on customer balances, branded checkout, Braintree, and Venmo were the largest contributors to year-over-year growth.

 

Branded checkout and Venmo's strong transaction margin results benefited from ongoing efforts to improve and optimize transaction loss performance as well as some transaction expense favorability.

While it's still early, we are encouraged to see initial actions related to price value, as well as product and ongoing risk enhancements make a positive impact.

 

Relative to last quarter, we saw Braintree return to profitable growth and improvements in the contribution from Venmo, Branded Checkout, and P2P.

Non-transaction-related operating expenses declined 1% as we continue to actively manage our cost structure, while reinvesting in key growth initiatives.

 

Non-GAAP operating income grew 24% in the quarter to $1.5 billion.

Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.5% benefiting from expense leverage and improvement in transaction margin trends.

 

PayPal generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter, and we completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases, bringing share repurchases over the past 12 months to approximately $5 billion.

Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of more than $18 billion and debt of just over $12 billion.

 

Moving to guidance on Slide 10 for the third quarter and the full year in 2024, for the remainder of the year, we continue to guide, assuming a relatively consistent macroeconomic and consumer spending environment.

For the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow by mid-single digits and non-GAAP EPS to grow by high single digits.

 

We are raising our guidance for the full year and now expect 2024 non-GAAP EPS to grow in the low to mid-teens.

This increase reflects outperformance in the second quarter, as well as a slightly more positive view of the second half of the year, with some strategic reinvestment into growth initiatives.

 

Underpinning our guidance, we now expect transaction margin dollars to increase by a low to mid-single digit percentage for the full year.

We have seen steady profitable growth from our branded checkout business and feel confident in the progress our teams are making.

 

It is encouraging to see the initial impact of our initiatives related to price to value, as well as ongoing product enhancements in areas like P2P.

Some of our efforts, particularly on the innovation side, are still early and will take time to scale.

 

But we are encouraged by the initial results and customer response, as we begin moving from the test and pilot phases into launch.

As we move into the second half of the year, we expect to continue to make progress on these fronts, but there are a few factors to keep in mind.

 

Consistent with the strategy we laid out in prior quarters, our teams continue to prioritize high-quality, profitable growth as we execute against our long-term roadmap.

Related to this, we expect lower volume and revenue growth as we move through the second half of the year.

 

This is deliberate, and it shows good progress.

By strategically focusing on price-to-value in areas like large enterprise processing within Braintree, we are driving transaction margin dollar improvements even on a lower volume growth.

 

Offsetting some of these improvements, we expect a much smaller tailwind from growth and interest on customer balances, which represented an approximately 3 percentage point tailwind to transaction margin dollar growth in the first half.

We were also planning prudently and forecasting less favorability with some normalization in transaction and credit losses.

 

We continue to expect non-transaction operating expenses to increase slightly with ongoing efficiency funding our strategic growth investments.

Our investment spending will ramp as the year progresses to support our highest priority growth initiatives that go-to-market of new products, partnerships, and innovation, as well as reinvigorated marketing and brand campaigns for both PayPal and Venmo.

 

These investments are all in support of re-accelerating durable, profitable growth for the company.

Given the strong start to the year, we are raising our 2024 free cashflow guidance to approximately $6 billion.

 

We are also increasing our share buyback plan to $6 billion compared to our prior guidance for at least $5 billion.

In closing, we've been making good progress throughout the first half of 2024, as we drive significant change across the company.

 

We have clear opportunities to lean in further and ensure we stay on offense in what remains a competitive and dynamic environment.

We're excited about the path forward and look forward to updating you on our progress along the way.

 

With that, back to you, Alex.



Alex Chriss 

Thank you, Jamie.

 

To summarize, PayPal grew profitably again with strength in multiple areas, including branded, unbranded, and Venmo.

We are also starting to see traction in several initiatives.

 

Taken together, these results highlight the strength of PayPal's global commerce platform.

I'll leave you with one last example.

 

You've heard me talk about our Venmo customers, looking for us to provide more money in and money out opportunities.

As we are improving opportunities to spend Venmo balance with products like Venmo debit card or pay with Venmo, we are seeing a corresponding improvement in funds being used within the Venmo ecosystem rather than transferred out.

 

This is an example of meeting our customers where they are, solving their needs, and driving monetization and margin improvement in the process.

Overall, this was a strong quarter for PayPal, and it gives us the confidence to both increase our growth investments and raise our full year profit and free cash flow guide.

 

I'm proud of our team and excited about the coming quarters and years for PayPal.

Steve, let's go to Q&A.

 



Steve Winoker 

Thanks Alex.

 

Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask just one question, so we can get to as many people as possible.

Sarah, please open the line.

 
Operator

Thank you.

 

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.

Your line is open.

 



Ramsey El-Assal

Hi, thanks so much for taking my question and great to see all the progress that you're making.

 

Branded volumes maintain the X-leap year growth rate from last quarter.

Can you drill down a bit more into your strategy to drive branded growth acceleration?

 

You mentioned it focused on mobile vaulting user interface.

What are the most important levers?

 

And then maybe also, did Jamie's comments on lower volume right there at the end of the prepared remarks in the second half apply to both branded and unbranded volumes?

Thanks.

 



Alex Chriss

Yeah, thanks for the question, Ramsey.

 

You know, we're excited to see the progress that we've made on branded.

As you can see, we've got a consistent, loyal customer base that continues to use and love PayPal.

 

What we've been focused on over the last six months is really some of the things I've touched on before, the experiences particularly around mobile.

I touched on some of it in the comments, but the teams are working night and day now to improve everything from the vaulted experience, which is essential on mobile.

 

This is think of high usage, high repeat usage checkout experience where you actually vault PayPal as your default.

We've now improved that experience.

 

And as I mentioned, we're seeing a 75 to 110 basis point lift with our new experience.

We're also rolling out a new pay sheet experience overall, which simplifies, gives customers still the choice of whether they're using PayPal Balance or any instrument they want, as well as buy-now, pay-later, but just simplifying the experience.

 

And We are seeing a nice lift in conversion rate there as well.

So big focus on the end-to-end customer experience.

 

We feel like that combined with the ubiquity that we have just in marks across both mobile and web gives us the ability to continue to not only maintain, but where we want to be, which is taking share in the branded experience.



Jamie Miller

Great.

 

And Ramsey, on the second part of your question about lower volumes in the second half, that primarily relates to Braintree.

We are seeing both lapping of larger wins this year, particularly in the second half, and some shifting and normalization in the Braintree revenue profile, just as we enter into and really get into the process of working with our customers around our mission around profitable growth.

 

But on the branded checkout side of things, we expect the second half to be consistent with the first.

July is off to a good start.

 

What we've seen in July is very consistent with the first half so far.

So we feel pretty good about that.

 



Ramsey El-Assal

Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Darren Peller with Wolf Research.

 

Your line is open.



Darrin Peller

Hey, guys.

 

Thanks, and nice results, especially on the transaction margin side.

So I'll just start there and touch on the dynamics around what's contributing to it from mix versus you talked a lot about pricing per value, which we've heard more and more about in the industry also, so it's good to see, but maybe more direction and color on the contributing forces.

 

And adding onto that, the sustainability of the strength you saw this quarter in growing transaction margin dollars at these rates.

Help us understand your expectations there going forward now.

 

Obviously, you updated guidance, but really beyond just the next few months.

Thanks, guys.

 



Jamie Miller

Yeah, so good morning, Darrin.

 

Thank you.

So maybe I'll start with the biggest contributors to transaction margin dollar growth and talk a little bit about the second half there as well.

 

So we were really excited to see the broad base strengths and the acceleration.

There's a lot the team has underway and there's several significant contributors to the growth.

 

First, we talked about in my prepared remarks, interest income on customer balances.

That was about 3 points in the first half.

 

But second, and really very strong was branded checkout.

It continues to grow profitably as a healthy contributor to transaction margin dollar growth.

 

Braintree, which you mentioned, it is back to contributing to transaction margin dollar growth, which we're really excited about.

And it's really great to see some progress from our shift in focus there.

 

Venmo continues to benefit not only from the strong consumer, but, you know, we're doing a nice job in Venmo too, driving continued growth in monthly actives.

And then lastly, transaction loss favorability continued to be favorable in the second quarter as well, which was nice to see.

 

When we think about the second half, there is really a couple of things to think about there.

I'd say first is that our first half tailwinds around interest income, you know, will begin to decline.

 

We've just got higher comps in the second half of 2023, as rates were coming up in the second half of last year.

So that impact on transaction margin dollar growth, the percentage, that'll start to come down.

 

The second is that we saw transaction loss favorability in both the first quarter and the second quarter.

It is feeling more durable than we expected, even in the first quarter.

 

Having said that, we're planning for some normalization in the second half.

As we get better in transaction loss prevention and detection.

 

So do bad actors, and they continue to work hard to do different things.

And the second is we are launching a number of products in the second half.

 

And any time you launch products, we're just being prudent around how we think about transaction loss to make sure that if we have a few bugs in the process, we're working the kinks out as we go.

But the core business is solid.

 

We are more positive than we were three months ago on Braintree profitability, P2P, on transaction loss.

It's still early in our progress but we're driving significant change.

 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan.

 

Your line is open.



Tien-Tsin Huang

Hi, thanks.

 

Good results here.

I wanted to ask about the second half growth and investments.

 

It looks like in your guidance you're applying a fourth quarter step down in EPS performance there.

So does that, should we assume that that's heavy marketing around the holiday?

 

Can you maybe just give a little bit more specifics on what you're marketing exactly and what kind of return you're expecting?

Thanks.

 



Jamie Miller

Hi, Tien-Tsin.

 

Good morning.

I'll take the first part, and then maybe Alex will want to comment on the marketing pieces of it.

 

So in the first half, we've done, I think, a really nice job with expense discipline.

We've taken a number of actions to reduce our OpEx profile, while at the same time remixing or prioritizing investment back into engineering product and some marketing.

 

Now we intentionally deferred in the first half some marketing dollars to the second half.

So when you look at the second half profile, you're seeing the same underlying core reinvestment in engineering and go-to-market and things like that.

 

But you're also seeing a much bigger ramp in our marketing spend, you know, around marketing and brand campaigns for both PayPal and Venmo.

But really also around these product launches, really making sure we put our marketing dollars to work to have that hit the ground running the way we need to.

 

So in the second half, when you think about the EPS guide side of it, more than half of that 4Q pressure is the ramping of those growth investments.

The other side, I'll just mention this quickly while around the topic, is that we've got a higher tax rate in the second half than we have in the first half.

 

And so that, particularly on a comparative basis to last year, is what's impacting some of the EPS profile?



Alex Chriss

Yeah, and just to pile on and dig a little bit deeper, you know, this is very deliberate.

 

The first half of the year, we needed to invest in innovation and invest in the customer experiences and put to market experiences on both PayPal and Venmo from a consumer standpoint that we can be proud of.

I feel like we are at that place now.

 

The experience on the PayPal app, what we are putting out on branded experiences, and even just the engagements, just the new designs, the shopping and rewards that now exist inside of the PayPal app is completely rebuilt and new.

On the Venmo side, you've seen the improvement as we started to create real onboarding ramps for our debit card, and we are seeing the improvement there.

 

So feeling really good about the experiences on both of the apps and it's time to tell the world about it.

And we are excited to ramp up some of our go-to-market spend in sort of exciting and engaging ways.

Your next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein.

 

Your line is open.



Harshita Rawat

Hi, good morning.

 

Alex, I want to ask about Europe.

Historically PayPal has grown in the region despite not investing enough.

 

How are you thinking about Europe among PayPal's international markets?

Looks like the company has a very strong local presence and the regulatory environment is now more favorable with respect to NFC access [iPhone] (ph)?

 

Thank you.



Alex Chriss

Yeah, I think it's a great question, and it's one of the things that we may overlook sometimes when we just think about PayPal.

 

We are a global company, and the way customers use us, whether it be cross-border, whether it be access to merchants all over the world, is truly a global phenomenon.

We've invested heavily over the years in ensuring that we are compliant in everywhere that we want to be in over 200 different markets.

 

You know, as we think about our strategy, as I've laid out in the past, to make sure that PayPal is available everywhere for every purchase every time.

That includes being able to be available in an omnichannel solution, whether it's e-commerce or whether it's in-person.

 

And with some of the changes coming particularly in Europe around NFC, that opens up the opportunity for us and we will be prepared shortly to be able to play in that space.

So it's exciting to see our growth.

 

I'll hit one more example.

Our buy now pay later growth that we continue to see, 60% of that volume comes from outside of the US.

 

So we are bringing the entire ecosystem of what PayPal brings to the global stage and excited to continue to invest there.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird.

 

Your line is open.



Colin Sebastian

Great, thanks, and good morning to everybody.

 

I was curious on the SMB initiatives, in particular the strategy to drive more adoption of branded checkouts, how important Fastlane is that initiative.

And then also, if you think advertising can be ultimately a lever for that side of the business as well on both sides of the network.

 

Thank you.



Alex Chriss

Yeah, it's a great question.

 

And SMB, as I've said since I got here, I think is an untapped opportunity for us.

So let's just pull back and talk about what SMBs really need.

 

Small businesses are there fighting for every customer.

They need to be able to find customers, they need to be able to engage with customers, convert them, and then reengage with them.

 

And really what they're looking for is an end-to-end platform and an end-to-end solution to help them.

It is very difficult for a small business to piece together 17 different solutions.

 

They just don't have the bandwidth, the people, and the time to be able to make that happen.

With PPCP, we now have put together the most powerful single platform for them to be able to run their business in a full stack manner.

 

So with PPCP, you now get branded experiences with the best branded experiences.

You get access to the best guest checkout conversion with Fastlane.

 

You get unbranded processing so that you can ensure that you can process anywhere around the world.

You get every mark.

 

You get buy-now pay-later.

You get access to our working capital.

 

And then as you mentioned, now that we start to roll out our ads platform, you get the ability to drive new customers.

You also get the ability to re-engage with customers in a delightful way, so package tracking, smart receipts, the ability to be able to re-market to customers even after they've purchased.

 

All of this is in one place with one partner.

And so, you know, we're in early days right now.

 

PPCP really is just rolling out.

We're excited about the progress and the growth, but there's a lot more to play here.

 

Live in 30 markets and through 40 partner channels.

But I think we're just getting started.

 

This is going to play out over the next few years.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.

 

Your line is open.



Sanjay Sakhrani

Good morning.

 

It's nice to hear about the accelerated general availability of Fastlane.

Maybe you could talk about what it means from a revenue contribution standpoint.

 

And if not this year, maybe we could just talk about how we should think about the revenue contribution.

Would it be through more engagement?

 

And then maybe just secondly, if you could just talk about the volume trends.

It seemed like US was pretty stable, international dropped off.

 

Maybe you could fill a bit more color there would be helpful.

Thanks.

 



Alex Chriss

Yeah, let me start with Fastlane.

 

So just as a reminder for everyone, Fastlane is really tackling the 60% of checkout that is guest checkout.

We've got a unique experience because of the volume of our two-sided network and the consumers that we see coming in, where we're able to dramatically change the conversion rate for repeat users.

 

So 80% conversion rate versus a traditional roughly 50% on a repeat user.

Our goal is to capture and help all merchants for all guest checkouts.

 

So the way we built Fastlane is this really is a platform that can be processed or agnostic.

And we want to be able to help every consumer come through and have a delightful guest checkout experience.

 

As well as enable actually our ability to capture them through a Fastlane by PayPal experience and bring them into a branded experience as well.

So there's a flywheel effect.

 

In terms of rollout, we're rolling this out now.

We've got a developer day situated in a few weeks from this time in August.

 

We're going GA now in August as well, and so we'll be ramping up as many customers as we can.

We've not talked about and disclosed pricing on this, so I'm not going to get into that at this point.

 

But know that this is our ability to monetize not just guest checkout that we process through Braintree but really for us the total addressable market is the entire guest checkout experience across the board.



Jamie Miller

Yeah and on the second part of your question around the US and international environments, you know as I mentioned before we see the US environment being very consistent right now with what we've seen over the first half.

 

International is a real strength for us and we did have a shift, down a bit in the international area on TPV this quarter, but when you look at that, what that really is, it's almost solely related to lapping some large Braintree [wins] (ph) last year, otherwise very healthy.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho.

 

Your line is open.



Dan Dolev

Hey, guys.

 

Good morning.

Thank you for letting me ask the question.

 

Great results.

I wanted to ask you, Alex a little bit about the competitive positioning regarding Apple Pay.

 

Obviously, really strong branded checkout.

There has been some worries in the past.

 

Can you maybe contextualize a little bit where we are and you know what you're doing to beat them?

Thank you.

 



Alex Chriss

Yeah thanks Dan, great question.

 

So let me set some context.

So first we play in a massive multi-trillion dollar market and it's not a zero-sum game.

 

So we expect competitors, we've had competitors come in since we launched, you know, over a decade ago.

We went from one button to now there's lots of different buttons and branded experiences and we'll expect that to continue.

 

Let me, though, set the context of the reality of today, and then how we think about the future.

So the reality today, we are the Number #1 branded experience across all platforms and devices.

 

If we narrow down into desktop web, which is still 40% to 50% of all checkout, we see no degradation in our share over the past four years.

So let me say that again.

 

We've held share despite competition.

Second, if we look across browsers, there's actually no difference in our selection rate across different browsers.

 

So certain buttons moving from one platform to the other just isn't material to us.

So that's where we are today.

 

So let us focus around our ability to continue to improve and make this a better experience for our consumers going forward.

So for merchants, they're looking for an end-to-end solution.

 

They want to get customers, they want to convert customers, and they want to engage and have a return experience with customers.

As we talked about, we now have the best branded experience.

 

We're continuing to improve that.

We have Fastlane, we have the best checkout experience.

 

And we've rolled out ads and continuing to invest in our profiles.

So we are helping merchants end-to-end.

 

On a consumer side, they're looking for ubiquity, flexibility, and a rewarding experience.

We are the most ubiquitous.

 

We have 80% acceptance rate in the developed world with a large and growing customer base.

And from a flexibility standpoint, they want to be able to pay everywhere with any way that they can -- that they want to pay and we're able to provide that.

 

So if you pull back, I'm just excited that we are in a strong position of being the most complete platform and two-sided global network, driving the highest value and benefit to our consumers and our merchants.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with UBS Financial.

 

Your line is open.



Timothy Chiodo

Great.

 

Thanks a lot for taking the question.

I wanted to drill into, branded checkout a little bit with the 6% growth.

 

Maybe you could talk a little bit about the relative levels of growth, US versus International.

Branded, you did call out the strength and international with continental Europe and Asia.

 

And then also on the relative levels of transaction margin, given that there are some differences in transaction expense levels and also potentially merchant size mix.

Would appreciate those.

 

Thanks.



Jamie Miller

Yeah, so on a relative level of growth, US and international, both continue to be strong contributors for us.

 

There's obviously different market mixes and different [merchant] (ph) mixes, as you look at those growth profiles.

You know, in the US, large enterprises continue to be an area of strength for us.

 

And I would say, in the small business area, we continue to remix that portfolio as we move to PPCP and off of legacy platforms and really move to both a direct and a partner strategy there.

You know, when you look at the international side of things, branded checkout is very, very strong in several European, both countries and corridors.

 

UK continues to be pressured, but I would say outside of that, we've got real strength in other countries such as Germany and just real bright spots in Europe as well.

So I'd say it is fairly balanced across the globe when you look at it.

 

I'm trying to look at the second part of your question here.

Transaction expense.

 

You know, when you look at transaction expense, it is impacted by funding mix, product mix, geo mix, all of that stuff.

Funding mix relatively stable.

 

The biggest driver of our shift in TE right now is been Braintree, and that continues to be what is happening there.

We're always looking at ways to continuously improve our transaction expense profile and work with different partners to move the needle on that.

 

And we continue to have different benefits, different quarters just in terms of how that rolls-through, none of which was particularly material, but we had a little bit of that too.

Jason Kupferberg

Good morning guys, thanks.

 

I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on the full year guide for the transaction profit dollar growth.

Obviously you're ticking that up here.

 

It does imply the deceleration in the second half that you mentioned around flow comps, et cetera.

What I'm trying to get a sense of, has your full year outlook for transaction profit dollar growth from the core branded and Braintree businesses changed, just to kind of isolate the delta here in the guidance?

 



Jamie Miller

Yeah, I would say generally we are seeing a stronger branded baseline and we're having increasing confidence in the slope of our Braintree profitability efforts.

 

That's what I would say on those two.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.

 

Your line is open.



James Faucette

Great, thank you so much.

 

Want to circle back to Fastlane and obviously a lot of interest and excitement in terms of its launch timing, et cetera.

And I think you've made it pretty clear that this will be kind of a gradual opportunity that will build on it and addressing a big market.

 

How should we think about, like, what your key to-dos are as we go through the rest of this year and into next year?

And I'm wondering if any of Fastlane with the launch timing is now built into the guidance, as well as any other new initiatives that may have been added into guidance for the rest of the year.

 

Thanks.



Alex Chriss

Yeah, let me start with the last part.

 

We really not built any Fastlane upside into guidance.

And part of that is because of our go-to-market is going to be very focused on just getting adoption, not around monetizing in this half of the year.

 

Now, to be clear, we are pricing in the contracts that we're signing with customers, and so pricing is built in and as I said before, the TAM is every guest checkout.

That's what our focus is.

 

But it's not built into the second half of the year.

In terms of key to-dos, we really created and worked hard during this beta period to create a seamless experience so that developers and merchants can get on board as fast as possible.

 

And so, you know, for someone using us now, it is really a four to four week experience to get onto the Fastlane code and enable that to roll out.

So we need to get it on as many platforms as we can, so that small businesses in particular can just one click a button and turn it on for the holidays.

 

We are working with many of our large enterprises who want access to this before the holidays as well.

But again, look, the reality is we've got a lot of merchants around the world, and it is going to take time for them to be able to put this into their roadmap.

 

So that's why we want to set expectations that this is going to take quarters and years to get everyone on board.

But the beauty of Fastlane is it's a network effect.

 

More customers coming through it, we are already seeing best-in-class conversion rates.

The more customers that come through it, the more profiles that we start to capture, and the better the conversion rates should become.

 

So we want to get started as fast as possible, get as many merchants through this holiday season as we can, and then build from there.

Hey Alex and Jamie.

Maybe you could talk a little bit more about what's driving that, clearly more disciplined, lapping of large contracts?

 

And then as we look to the back half and beyond, I hear you on the slope that's kind of built into the outlook.

But from what you've seen so far, how does it inform your confidence in terms of building on the progress that you've seen so far in transaction margin dollar growth as we go into the back half in the subsequent years?

 

Thanks a lot.



Jamie Miller

So, good morning Andrew.

 

Thank you.

So first well, let's just talk through the Braintree growth and what's really driving that.

 

We set out this year to really reorient the team with Braintree around profitable growth.

And as we've done that -- we've had just a number of conversations with customers, both around contract renewal, but also just around our holistic relationship and really getting into understanding how we partner, what the margin structure is, how we provide value-added services, just the overall value-to-value exchange that we have got.

 

And honestly, they've been really positive conversations as we -- and just on a total relationship basis sort of thing.

As we looked at that, there are certain situations where as we've gotten into the discussion, we are willing to accept a lower share of revenue in exchange for a higher margin contract.

 

There is other situations where, as we work with our customers, we are able to sell in value-added services in ways that we just haven't done before.

So it is lots of different levers in that process.

 

But what we are excited about is we are really starting to see good traction on that.

It is intentional.

 

We've set out to do this.

And it is a really good thing for the business.

 

And I think as you look at the second half, what we saw play out in the second quarter, I expect to continue.

We saw some of the volume growth normalize a bit, but we saw more positive transaction margin dollar growth.

 

And it is really good to see that tangible progress play out.

And I think it will continue to play out over time.

 

It may be a little bit uneven and not linear, but that trend of a little bit more normalization into the business, but improving margin profiles is something we fully expect to continue.



Steve Winoker

Alex, I think you have time for any final comments you might have?

 



Jamie Miller

Yes.

 

Thank you all today, and thanks Steve.

Just to close the call, company is energized.

 

We are proud of what we've accomplished, just to again, sort of step -- set the context of where we are.

We are really six months in.

 

We've got a new leadership team.

We are getting stronger every day.

 

We've returned the company to transaction margin growth.

We've returned the company to a consumer user growth.

 

We significantly improved profitability at Braintree, and we are accelerating Venmo.

And so I just feel really proud that we are stronger today than we were six months ago, and we will be stronger six months from now than we are today.

 

And we are executing against our game plan.

This will be measured in quarters and years.

 

So it will be a long game, but six months in, we are on the right trajectory.

So thank you all for today and see you next quarter.

Good morning ladies and gentlemen.

 

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.

This call is being recorded.

 

Your line will be muted for the duration of the call.

We will now go live to the presentation.

 

The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements.

Please stand by.

 

At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum.

Mr.

 

Barnum, please go ahead.



Jeremy Barnum 

Thank you and good morning everyone.

 

Starting on Page one, the firm reported net income of $18.1 billion, EPS of $6.12 on revenue of $51 billion with an ROTCE of 28%.

These results included the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion foundation contribution of the appreciated Visa stock.

 

Also included is $546 million of net investment securities losses in corporate.

Excluding these items, the firm had net income of $13.1 billion, EPS of $4.40, and an ROTCE of 20%.

 

Touching on a couple of highlights, in the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year and 17% quarter-on-quarter, and market revenue was up 10% year-on-year.

In CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and card and we've continued to see strong net inflows across AWM.

 

Now before I get more detail on the results I just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer explicitly calling out the First Republic contribution in the presentation.

Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in the year-on-year comparison.

 

As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior year quarter only has two months of First Republic results compared to the full three months this quarter.

Also in the prior year quarter most of the expenses were in corporate whereas now they are primarily in the relevant line-of-business.

 

Now turning to Page 2 for the firm-wide results.

The firm reported revenue of $51 billion, up $8.6 billion, or 20% year-on-year.

 

Excluding both the Visa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, revenue of $43.1 billion was up $3.4 billion or 9%.

NII ex-Markets was up $568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, higher revolving balances in card, and the additional month of First Republic related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances.

 

NIR ex-Markets was up $7.3 billion or 56%.

Excluding the items I just mentioned, it was up $2.1 billion or 21%, largely driven by higher investment banking revenue and asset management fees.

 

Both periods included net investment securities losses.

And markets revenue was up $731 million or 10% year-on-year.

 

Expenses of $23.7 billion were up $2.9 billion or 14% year-on-year.

Excluding the foundation contribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9% primarily driven by compensation including revenue related compensation and growth in employees.

 

And credit costs were $3.1 billion reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million.

Net charge-offs were up $820 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card.

 

The net reserve build included $609 million in consumer and $189 million in wholesale.

Onto balance sheet and capital on Page 3.

 

We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3% up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, largely offset by capital distributions and higher RWA.

As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points.

 

Let me summarize them again here.

Our preliminary SCB is 3.3%, although the final SCB could be higher.

 

The preliminary SCB, which is up from the current requirement of 2.9%, results in a 12.3% standardized CET1 ratio requirement, which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of 2024.

And finally the firm announced that the Board intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $1.15 to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2024.

 

Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4.

CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion on revenue of $17.7 billion, which was up 3% year-on-year.

 

In banking and wealth management, revenue was down 5% year-on-year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin compression, partially offset by growth and wealth management revenue.

Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter.

 

Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance.

In home lending, revenue of $1.3 billion was up 31% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including one additional month of the First Republic portfolio.

 

Turning to Card services and Auto, revenue was up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card NII and higher revolving balances.

Card outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve.

 

And in Auto, originations were $10.8 billion, down 10% coming off strong originations from a year ago, while continuing to maintain healthy margins.

Expenses of $9.4 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines-of-business, as I mentioned earlier, as well as field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing.

 

In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion up $813 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card, as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues.

The net reserve build was $579 million, also driven by Card, due to loan growth and updates to certain macroeconomic variables.

 

Next, the Commercial and Investment Bank on Page 5.

Our new Commercial and Investment Bank reported net income of $5.9 billion on revenue of $17.9 billion.

 

You'll note that we are disclosing revenue by business, as well as breaking down the banking and payments revenue by client coverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the wholesale franchise.

This quarter, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year, and we Ranked Number #1 with year-to-date wallet share of 9.5%.

 

And advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven by the closing of a few large deals in a week prior year quarter.

Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with equity up 56% and debt up 51%, benefiting from favorable market conditions.

 

In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year-on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter.

We remain cautiously optimistic about the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect.

 

It's also worth noting that pull-forward refinancing activity was a meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year.

Payments revenue was $4.5 billion, down 4% year-on-year, as deposit margin compression and higher deposit related client credits were largely offset by fee growth.

 

Moving to markets, total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year.

Fixed income was up 5% with continued strength in securitized products.

 

And equity markets was up 21%, with equity derivatives up on improved client activity.

We saw record revenue in Prime on growth and client balances amid supportive equity market levels.

 

Security services revenue of $1.3 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compression.

Expenses of $9.2 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher revenue related compensation, legal expense, and volume related non-compensation expense.

 

In banking and payments, average loans were up 2% year-on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially.

Demand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic environment, and revolver utilization continues to be below pre-pandemic levels.

 

Also, capital markets are open and are providing an alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients.

In CRE, higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination and payoff activity.

 

Average client deposits were up 2% year-on-year and relatively flat sequentially.

Finally, credit costs were $384 million.

 

The net reserve build of $220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the Firm's modeled approach.

Net charge-offs were $164 million, of which about half was in office.

 

Then to complete our lines-of-business, AWM on Page 6.

Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.3 billion with pre-tax margin of 32%.

 

Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression.

Expenses of $3.5 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams.

 

For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $52 billion, led by equities and fixed income.

And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $16 billion.

 

AUM of $3.7 trillion was up 15% year-on-year.

And client assets of $5.4 trillion were up 18% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows.

 

And finally, loans and deposits were both flat quarter-on-quarter.

Turning to corporate on Page 7.

 

Corporate reported net income of $6.8 billion on revenue of $10.1 billion.

Excluding this quarter's Visa-related gain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately $450 million year-on-year.

 

NII was up $626 million year-on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates.

Expenses of $1.6 billion were up $427 million year-on-year, excluding foundation contribution expenses were down $573 million year-on-year, largely as a result of moving First Republic related expense out of corporate into the relevant segments.

 

To finish up, we have the outlook on Page 8.

Our 2024 guidance, including the drivers, remains unchanged from what we said at Investor Day.

 

We continue to expect NII and NII ex-markets of approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and on credit, Card net charge-off rate of approximately 3.4%.

So to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net income.

 

But more importantly, after excluding the significant items, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong.

And as always, we remain focused on continuing to execute with discipline.

 

And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.
Operator

For our first question, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research.

 

Please go ahead.



Steven Chubak

Hi.

 

Good morning, Jeremy.



Jeremy Barnum

Good morning Steve.

 



Steven Chubak

So, I wanted to start off with a question on capital.

 

Just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time.

As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus a 17% target?

 

And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward?



Jeremy Barnum

Right, okay.

 

Thanks Steve.

And actually before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today.

 

Okay.

Good question on the capital and the ROTCE.

 

So let me start with the ROTCE point first.

In short, my answer to that question would be no.

 

It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE.

If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that you know before the Basel III endgame proposal, we had a 17% through cycle target and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator.

 

And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually increase the ROTCE.

And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed.

 

So as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and you know, it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here, but in reality, we don't know anything -- you don't know.

We don't know how reliable the press coverage is.

 

And so in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made subsequent week at an industry conference.

So maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio.

 

But obviously we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirements.

So after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the Capital one way or another is a matter of when, not if.

 

On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly.

You know, growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the Board's announced intention to increase it to a $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year, so that's a testament for our performance and that is a return of capital.

 

And then finally buyback, but that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter.

And so, as we said here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it is kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patients.

 

So given all that, putting it all together I'm sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital.

And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store, as much as anything else.

 



Steven Chubak

No need to apologize, Jeremy.

 

That was a really helpful perspective.

Maybe just for my follow-up on NII.

 

You've been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to NII over earning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition, as well as repricing headwinds.

In the second quarter, we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures.

 

Deposit balances were also more resilient in what's a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth.

So just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating.

 

Do you see the potential for NII normalizing higher?

And where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

Interesting question, Steve.

So let's talk about deposit balances.

 

So yes I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating.

When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, Q2 is still a bit of a headwind.

 

Loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that.

And RRP seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system.

 

But on balance, net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances.

So when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe, with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds.

 

So in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what.

But I think it is definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the over earning narrative or the normalization narrative.

 

Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook.

So two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there.

 

But obviously, based on the latest completion data and so on, you could usually get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve.

So we'll see how it goes.

 

And in the end, we are kind of focused on just running the place, recognizing and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of over earning, whatever it is.



Steven Chubak

Understood, Jeremy.

 

Thanks so much for taking my questions.



Jeremy Barnum

Thanks Steve.

 
Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Saul Martinez from HSBC.

 

Please go ahead.



Saul Martinez

Hi, good morning.

 

Thanks for taking my question.

Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer?

 

You noted, obviously, that you think there is an error in the Fed’s calculation due to OCI.

Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed looks like?

 

Is there a process to modify the SCB higher?

And if you could give us a sense of what that process looks like.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

So I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed.

Not to confirm or deny that they even exist, that stuff is private.

 

And so -- and then if you talk about like the timing here, right?

So you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released 3.3%, is a preliminary number.

 

By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31, it may come sooner.

You talked about an error in the calculation, we haven't used that word.

 

What we know -- what we believe, rather, is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed’s disclosed results looked non-intuitively high to us.

And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer.

 

Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens.

I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma SCB, whatever it might conceivably be, you actually see once again, quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms.

 

And just sort of reiterating and -- another example of what we've said a lot over the years, that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank.

It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do things.

 

So I'll leave it at that.



Saul Martinez

Okay.

 

Got it.

That's helpful.

 

Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question.

I think you highlighted in response as a matter of when not if.

 

And obviously, Jamie is not there.

You can't speak for Jamie.

 

But seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or buybacks at current valuations.

Can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about the various options?

 

Any updated thoughts on your special dividend?

And can you do other things like for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout sort of a step function increase, where -- keep that flat and grow into that grow your earnings into that over time?

 

Can you just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital.



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

I mean I would direct you to read -- actually, I have Jamie's comments at the industry conference where you participated the week after Investor Day, because he wanted just a good amount of detail on this stuff addressing some of these points.

And I think his comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really a preference.

 

We hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice.

So I think the larger point is just that -- a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit, and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy.

 

So first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth.

And then the dividend, I think, we are always going to want to keep it in that like sustainable, and also sustainable in a stress environment.

 

So that continues to be the way we think about that.

And then at the end of it, it is buybacks.

 

And Jamie has been on the record for over a decade, I think over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation, and price is a factor.

So that's sort of the totality of the sort of options, I guess.

 



Saul Martinez

Okay, great.

 

Thanks a lot.



Jeremy Barnum 

Thanks Saul.

 
Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.

 

Please go ahead.



Ken Usdin

Thanks a lot.

 

Good morning Jeremy.

Jeremy, great to see the progress on investment banking fees, up sequentially and 50% year-over-year.

 

And I saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space.

And we clearly didn't see the debt pull-forward play through, because DCM was great again.

 

I'm just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the potential.

And just where the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of like how does this feel in terms of current environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead?

 

Thanks.



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

Thanks, Ken.

It's progress, right?

 

I mean we are happy to see the progress.

People have been talking about [depressed] (ph) banking fee wallet for some time, and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop on the low base, but also a nice sequential improvement.

 

So that's the first thing to say.

In terms of dialogue and engagement, it's definitely elevated.

 

So as the dialogue on ECM is elevated and the dialogue on M&A is quite robust as well.

So all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space.

 

But there are some important caveats.

So on the DCM side, yes, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull forward, and therefore we are reasonably cautious about the second half of the year.

 

Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to for example, acquisition finance.

So the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of actual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well.

 

And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refi, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher.

On ECM, if you look at it kind of at [remove] (ph), you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs, for example.

 

And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect.

And that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that as has been widely discussed, that extent to which the performance of the large industries is driven by like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance.

 

Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple of years ago was raised at pretty high valuations.

And so in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down rounds, that's an issue.

 

And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases, people still have concerns about that.

So those are a little bit of overhang on that space.

 

I think we can hope that, over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust.

And yes, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there.

 

And so we'll just have to see how that plays out.



Ken Usdin

Great.

 

Thank you for all that Jeremy.

And just one on the consumer side.

 

Just anything you're noticing in terms of people who just have been waiting for this delinquency stabilization on the credit card side.

Obviously, your loss rates are coming in as you expected, and we did see 30 days pretty flat and 90 days come down a little bit.

 

Any -- is that seasonal?

Is it just a good rate of change trend?

 

Any thoughts there?

Thanks.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

I still feel like when it comes to Card charge-offs and delinquencies, there's just not much to see there.

It's still -- it's normalization, not deterioration.

 

It's in-line with expectations.

As I say, we always look quite closely inside the cohort, inside the income cohorts.

 

And when you look in there, specifically, for example on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior that's consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lower income segments, where you see a little bit of rotation of the spend out of discretionary into non-discretionary.

But the effects are really quite subtle, and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that we are seeing, which, while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions, say, like they've been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seeing moderating GDP growth.

 

And so it is not entirely surprising that you're seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend.

So it all kind of hangs together in what is sometimes actually not a very interesting story.

 



Ken Usdin

Thank you.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Thanks Ken.

 
Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.

 

Please go ahead.



Glenn Schorr

Hi, thanks very much.

 

So Jeremy, the discussions so far around private credit and you all, your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front.

I do think that most of the discussion has been about the direct-lending component.

 

So I'm curious if you are showing more progress and activity on that front.

And then very importantly, do you see the same trend happening on the asset-backed finance side, because that's a bigger part of the world, and it is a bigger part of your business?

 

So I'd appreciate your thoughts there.

Thanks.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

Thanks, Glenn.

So on private credit, so nothing really new to say there.

 

I think -- I guess one way the environment is evolving a little bit is that as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals.

And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing kind of like not that many deals.

 

So the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin.

Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated lender finance market making their way into the private market as well, is sort of people realize that even in the private market, you probably need some of those protections in some cases.

 

Which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on.

So we feel optimistic about our offering there.

 

I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was.

So it is maybe not a great moment to like kind of test whether we are doing a lot more or less in the space, so to speak.

 

And then on asset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before.

And at the time, my answer was that I haven't heard much about that trend, and that continues to be the case.

 

But clearly, there must be something I'm missing.

So I can follow up on that and maybe we can have a chat about it.

 



Glenn Schorr

That's great for you if you are not hearing much about it, so we can leave it at that.

 

Maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your just overall posturing on -- you were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great.

We know that story.

 

Now it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you are being patient and rates are high.

And I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Right.

 

I mean on duration, in truth we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters.

So that's one thing to say, that was more last quarter than this quarter.

 

But I guess I would just caution you from -- a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet, and concluding that when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front.

So clearly, it is true that empirically, we've behaved like very asset sensitively in this rate hiking cycle, and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near-term.

 

But when we look at the fund's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both like the [EAR type lens] (ph), the short-term NIR sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital from higher rates.

And as I think Jamie has said a couple of times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front.

 

Also, given like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're walking in 5.5% rate.

In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on.

 

So I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front in mind for us.



Glenn Schorr 

Super, helpful.

 

Thanks so much for that.



Jeremy Barnum

Thanks Glenn.

Next, we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.

 

Please go ahead.



Matt O'Connor

Good morning.

 

I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and normalized at 17%.

Obviously, you've pointed to over-[earning NII] (ph).

 

And I guess the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%?

And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs?

 

Or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?



Jeremy Barnum

Sure.

 

Good question, Matt.

I mean, I guess the way I think about it is a couple of things.

 

Like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right?

So if you kind of build yourself out a full year forecast and make reasonable space on your own, or analyst consensus or whatever, and you think about the fourth quarter, better look at this on a full year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers, and you obviously have to strip out kind of the onetime items.

 

And so if you do that, like whatever you get for this year is still clearly a number that's higher than 17%.

So yes, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of the expected higher deposit costs.

 

That's -- we've talked about that.

Part of it is also the yield curve effects.

 

Some cuts will come into the curve at some point.

And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very supplemental model of the company, you would have like expenses grow -- revenue is growing at some organic GDP like rate, maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate, producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio.

 

But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background -- you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen.

So as much as our discipline on expense management is, as tight as it always has been, the inflation is still non-zero.

 

There are still investments that we're executing.

There is still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of in part, the normalization of NII.

 

And then the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far.

So of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%.

 

And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors.



Matt O'Connor

Yes.

 

That was a really helpful chart.

Just one follow-up.

 

On the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that?

Because right now, the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still leaving any impact of that.

 

But kind of longer-term, you'd expect a little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help.

But what does you mean by that?

 

Thank you.



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

I mean you and I talked about this before.

I guess I sort of -- I guess I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forwards is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean.

 

Like I mean people have different views about the so-called term premium.

And obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people thinking on that may be changing.

 

But I think we saw, when rates were at Zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of -- many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM and extra NII by extending duration a lot.

But when the steepness of the curve implies -- is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offside from the capital and other perspectives.

 

So there are some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of -- earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII, but that feels a bit speculative to me at this point.



Matt O'Connor

Got it.

 

Okay, thank you for the details.



Jeremy Barnum 

Thanks Matt.

 
Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities.

 

Please go ahead.



Mike Mayo

Hi.

 

Jeremy, you said it's too early to end the over earning narrative, and you highlighted higher deposit costs and the impact of lower rates and lower NII and DCM pull-forward and credit cost going higher.

Anything I'm missing on that list?

 

And what would cause you to end the over earning narrative?



Jeremy Barnum

No.

 

Actually, I think that is the right list Mike.

I mean, frankly, I think one thing that would end to be over earning narrative is if our annual returns were closer to 17%.

 

I mean to the extent that, that is the through-the-cycle number that we believe and that we are currently producing more than that, that's one very simple way to look at that.

But the pieces of that or the pieces that you talked about and the single most important piece is the deposit margin.

 

Our deposit margins are well above historical norms, and that is a big part of the reason that we still are emphasizing the over earning narrative.



Mike Mayo

You're 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE kind of expectation, what is the CET1 ratio that you assumed for that?

 



Jeremy Barnum

I mean we would generally assume requirements plus a reasonable buffer, which depending on the shape of rules, could be a little bit smaller or a little bit bigger.

 

And the small part as a function of the volatility of those pools, which goes back to my prior comments on SCB and CCAR.

But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more of the dollars.

 

And at this point, the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the RWA lands, and obviously things like GSIB recalibration and so on.

So we've done a bunch of scenario analysis along the lines of what I did at Investor Day that informs those numbers, but that is obviously one big element of uncertainty behind that 17%.

 

Which is why at Investor Day, when we talked about it, both Daniel and I were quite specific about saying that we thought 17% was still achievable, assuming a reasonable outcome on the Basel III endgame.



Mike Mayo

Let me just zoom out for one more question on the return target.

 

I mean when I asked Jamie at the [2013] (ph) Investor Day would it make sense to have 13.5% capital, he was basically telling you take a hike, right?

And now you have 15.3% capital and you're saying, well, we might want to have a lot more capital here.

 

I mean at some point, if you're spending $17 billion a year to improve the company, if you're gaining share with digital banking, if you're automating the back office, if you're moving ahead with AI, if you're doing all these things that I think you say others aren't doing, why wouldn't those returns go higher over time?

Or do you just assume you'll be competing those benefits away?

 

Thanks.



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

I mean, I think in short, Mike, and we've talked about this a lot and Jamie has talked about this a lot, it is a very, very, very competitive market.

And we are very happy with our performance.

 

We are very happy with the share we've taken.

And 17% is like an amazing number actually.

 

And like to be able to do that, given how robust the competition is from banks, from non-banks, from US banks, from foreign banks and all of the different businesses that we compete in, is something that we're really proud of.

So the number has a range around it, obviously.

 

So it's not a promise, it's not a guarantee and it can fluctuate.

But we are very proud to be in the ballpark of being able to think that we can deliver it, again assuming a reasonable outcome on Basel III endgame.

 

But it's a very, very, very competitive market across all of our products and services and regions and [line] (ph) segments.



Mike Mayo

All right.

 

Thank you.
Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.

 

Please go ahead.



Betsy Graseck

Hi, Jeremy.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Hi, Betsy.

 



Betsy Graseck

So I did want to ask one drill-down question on 2Q, and it is related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do.

 

I think in the press release, right and the slide deck, it's $4.9 billion common stock net repurchases.

So the question here is what's the governor for you on how much to do every quarter?

 

And I mean I understand it is a function of okay, how much do we organically grow.

But even with that, so you get the organic growth which you had some nice movement there.

 

But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings?

Or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time?

 

And I remember at Investor Day, the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are right?

So I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

That's a very good and fair question, Betsy.

So let me try to unpack it to the best of my abilities.

 

So -- in no particular order.

One thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually, is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks.

 

So we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of -- and we prefer the right to sort of change that at any time.

So I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief.

 

And so I might as well say it explicitly.

It was pretty clear in the [Q] (ph) also, but I'm just going to say that again.

 

So that's point one.

But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors.

 

So generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say.

Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we are always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely.

 

But I think some modest amount of buybacks, is a reasonable thing to do when you are generating your kind of capital.

And so we were talking before about this $2 billion pace, we're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way.

 

You talked about the $4.9 million, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number.

But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we made, that we have these significant item gains from Visa.

 

And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and liquid large cap financial stock, i.e.

Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock.

 

And so in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock.

So we talked about, Jamie talked about as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM, and that's what we did this quarter.

 

So that is why the 4.9% is a little higher.

And it's consistent with my comments at our Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks.

 

And beyond that what you are left with is answer to Steve's question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, when we are generating these types of earnings and there is this much organic capital being generated, in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy but sustainable dividend, if we don't return the capital, we are going to keep growing the CET1 ratio, the levels of which -- if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable.

They're just artificially high and unnecessary.

 

So one way or the other, that will need to be addressed at some point.

It's just that we don't feel now is the right time.

 



Betsy Graseck

Great.

 

Thank you Jeremy.

Appreciate it.

 



Jeremy Barnum

Next, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets.

 

Please go ahead.



Gerard Cassidy

Hi, Jeremy, how are you?

 



Jeremy Barnum

Hi, Gerard.

 



Gerard Cassidy

Jeremy, can you -- I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question.

 

I noticed on the average balances, the non-interest bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter-to-quarter versus prior quarters when they have steadily declined.

And this is one of the areas, of course investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers.

 

Can you elaborate, if you can, what you're seeing in that non-interest-bearing deposit account?

I know this is average and not period end, the period end number may actually be lower.

 

But what are you guys seeing here?



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

Good question, Gerard.

I have to be honest, I haven't focused on that particular sequential explain i.e., quarter-on-quarter change and average non-interest-bearing deposits.

 

But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect?

I mean how are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment, and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits.

 

And the answer to that question is that we do continue to expect that migration to happen.

So if you think about it in the wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances in non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing.

 

So we do continue to expect that migration to happen, and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds.

And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs.

 

Sometimes it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business.

And some of it does leave the company.

 

But one of the things that we are encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield-seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises.

So big picture.

 

I do think that migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing will continue to be a thing, and that is a contributor to the modest headwinds that we expect for NII right now.

But yes I'll leave it at that, I guess.

 



Gerard Cassidy

Very good.

 

And as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the consumer credit card charge-offs and delinquency levels.

And we all know about the commercial real estate office, and you always talk about over-earning on net interest income of course.

 

One of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been for -- in this elevated rate environment.

And I know your numbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and Investment Bank, you had about a $500 million pickup in non-accrual loans.

 

Can you share with us what are you seeing in C&I?

Are there any signs of cracks or anything?

 

And again, I know your numbers are still good, but I'm just trying to look forward to see if there's something here over the next 12 months or so.



Jeremy Barnum

Yes, it's a good question.

 

I think the short answer is no, we are not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I.

I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time.

 

I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly.

I think the C&I charge-off rate we are seeing 10 years was something like literally zero.

 

So that is clearly very low by historical standards.

And while we take a lot of pride in that number, I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across bankers and the risk team, that's not -- we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation.

 

So you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that.

But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic.

 

So I don't think, that anything in the current quarter results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way, I would say.



Gerard Cassidy

Great, appreciate the insights as always.

 

Thank you.



Jeremy Barnum

Thanks Gerard.

 
Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS.

 

Please go ahead.



Erika Najarian

Hi, good morning.

 

I just had one cleanup question, Jeremy.

The consensus provision for 2024 is $10.7 billion.

 

Could you maybe clarify for once and for all sort of Jamie's comments at an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that $10.7 billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in Card?



Jeremy Barnum

Yes.

 

Happy to clarify that.

So Jamie's comments were that the allowance to build and the Card allowance, so we are talking about Card specifically, we expected something like $2 billion for the full year.

 

As I sit here today, our expectation for that number is actually slightly higher, but it is in the ballpark.

And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front.

 

So who knows what it will actually wind up being, but that remains our view.

One question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth.

 

But the reason that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that 12%, as well as seasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth.



Erika Najarian

Great.

 

Thank you.



Jeremy Barnum

Thanks Erika.

 
Operator

And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities.

 

Please go ahead.



Jim Mitchell

Hi, good morning.

 

Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital.

It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book.

 

So maybe two questions there.

One, trading assets were up 20% year-over-year.

 

Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand?

And is there further opportunities to grow that?

 

And then secondly outside of Cards, loan demand has been quite weak.

And any thoughts from you on if you're seeing any change in demand or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward?

 

Thanks.



Jeremy Barnum

Thanks, Jim.

 

Good question.

So yes, trading assets have been up.

 

That is basically client activity primarily secured financing related sort of matchbook repo type stuff and similar things that are -- grows up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore quite low RWA intensity.

So while our ability the supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients.

 

It's not really particularly RWA, and therefore capital intensive, and therefore it doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak.

On the loan demand front, yes, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand.

 

Meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card.

Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained.

 

So whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts, and what fits inside our credit risk appetite is growth that's going to make sense.

And so we're very happy to deploy capital to that.

 

But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that.

And of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we are going to do is have the excess capital mean that we lean in to lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure.

 

So there is always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally.

And frankly, that is in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now.

 

When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient.

That's a little bit one example of what I was referring to.

 



Jim Mitchell

Okay, great.

Jack Dorsey

Thank you all for joining us.

 

I focused my shareholder letter this quarter on our go-to-market strategy for Square and our efforts to improve acquisition across sales, partnerships, marketing, and product.

If you haven’t yet, please read that letter for details.

 

As part of this, I’m thrilled to share that Nick Molnar, the CEO and Co-Founder of Afterpay, will be leading a centralized sales function across Block, working across Square, Cash App, and Afterpay.

Nick shaped Afterpay’s high-performing sales culture, and we’re excited for him to raise the bar for Square and across Block.

 

This aligns with our recent decision to reorganize our company’s reporting structure by function, enabling more collaboration across our different ecosystems.

This will also help our people get to true mastery of their craft and open up opportunities for mobility within disciplines.

 

We plan to execute this change this month with minimal disruption.

The new reporting structure does not impact our strategy, roadmaps, or financial goals.

 

Instead we believe it will allow us to move with greater speed, agility, and efficiency on the growth initiatives we have discussed.

Similar to prior quarters, we’re going to keep our remarks brief to focus on your questions.

 

With that, I'll now turn it over to Amrita.



Amrita Ahuja

Thanks, Jack.

 

We delivered strong results across the company during the second quarter.

Gross profit was $2.23 billion, up 20% year over year.

 

By business, Square gross profit was $923 million, up 15% year-over-year and Cash App gross profit was $1.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year.

Both businesses showed strength in areas aligned to our strategies.

 

Gross profit outperformance compared to our guidance was mostly driven by Cash App.

We saw strength across Cash App Card, Cash App Borrow, and buy now, pay later.

 

Inflows per active saw healthy growth, up 10% year-over-year in the quarter, and was consistent quarter over quarter despite coming off the first quarter seasonal benefit of tax refunds.

Square’s gross profit was in-line with our expectations, with strength in software and integrated payments, and banking.

 

GPV growth in the quarter was up 8% year-over-year as strength from our markets outside the US was offset by a continued moderation in US same-store sales growth, consistent with broader macro data points.

From a profitability perspective we saw a significant increase on a year-over-year basis, with meaningful margin improvement, due to our improved efficiency and discipline on expenses.

 

Adjusted EBITDA was $759 million, nearly doubling year-over-year, and adjusted operating income was $399 million, up 16 times year-over-year.

For the 12 months ending in June, adjusted free-cash flow was $1.43 billion, which was up more than two times versus the prior 12 months and represented 57% of adjusted EBITDA, an improvement compared to the 44% conversion rate in the prior period.

 

Our strong profitable growth shows that our ecosystems continue to serve our customers with differentiated value, and our teams are operating with purpose and efficiency.

As Jack noted, our shift to a functional organizational structure is about deepening collaboration across our ecosystems.

 

What doesn't change is our commitment to our long-term target of achieving Rule of 40 in 2026 and our reporting of gross profit by business segment.

We'll also continue to hold our leaders accountable to our existing product roadmap and go-to-market timelines.

 

Turning to our expectations for the remainder of the year.

We are raising our full year 2024 guidance for both gross profit and profitability, reflecting not only outperformance in the second quarter, but also increased expectations for the remainder of the year.

 

For full year 2024, we are now expecting gross profit of at least $8.89 billion or 18% growth year-over-year.

This reflects our strong top line momentum as we head into the back half of the year.

 

We expect Cash App to deliver strong gross profit growth in the back half of the year with growth expected to moderate only slightly from the second quarter's 23%, even as we fully lap the benefit from improvements to our structural costs in the second half.

For Square, we expect year-over-year gross profit growth for the back half of the year to be relatively in line with the second quarter's growth rate.

 

We remain focused on cross-selling banking and software further into our seller base, and optimizing our processing value chain.

In the back half of the year, we expect GPV growth to be relatively stable, although we are mindful that the backdrop for consumer discretionary spending continues to be dynamic.

 

Our focus is on the things we can control, including executing against our product strategy and the go-to-market approach Jack outlined in his letter.

Over the past year, our discipline on operating expenses has driven significant operating leverage in our business.

 

While we do not share segment-adjusted operating income, we wanted to share a view of the business level profit margins we expect this year.

For 2024, we expect each of Cash App and Square's adjusted operating income margins to be in the high-teens range, delivering meaningful improvement in the underlying profitability of these businesses each of the last two years.

 

Across both ecosystems, our efforts are centered on initiatives that improve our product and go-to-market velocity, and which we expect to benefit us into 2025.

For Cash App, we continue to round out the features that support our bank the base strategy, and are starting to increase marketing investment behind them.

 

For Square, we're excited about our partnership strategy and planned product launches post completion of the orders migration work this summer.

Sellers will start to see our single point of sale app before year end, which will be a significant unlock for simplifying our value proposition.

 

From a profitability perspective, we are now expecting at least $1.44 billion in adjusted operating income in 2024, or 16% margins on gross profit, with efficiency initiatives underway to improve our structural costs and corporate overhead.

This also reflects plans for a step-up in sales and marketing in the back half for both Square and Cash App, as we invest behind the strong unit economics and margins in each business to drive growth into 2025.

 

Our updated guidance now implies Rule of 35 for full year 2024, a significant improvement compared to 2023, and progressing us towards our goal of achieving Rule of 40 in 2026.

Finally, as our margins and free cash flow generation have improved, we also plan to return more capital to shareholders.

 

We very recently completed our inaugural $1 billion share repurchase authorization.

And today, we're excited to announce an incremental $3 billion share repurchase program.

 

With that, I'll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call.

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.

 

Your line is open.



Tien-Tsin Huang

Thanks a lot.

 

Great results here.

I did like the go-to-market discussion in the letter here, Jack, and definitely excited for Nick to lead sales.

 

But I want to ask you, Jack, just curious what inspired this shift to a functional org structure?

Why now?

 

What outcomes do you, or should we expect from the change in the short to mid-term?

Is it more collaborative products, or is it just more products?

 

And what are the risks?

Because whenever we think about these kind of changes, I always worry about the risks and I'm sure you have some guardrails in place.

 

So anything you could share would be terrific.

Thanks.

 



Jack Dorsey

Yeah.

 

The short answer to the question is, it will result in much better technology, much better design, and ultimately a much better product.

We -- I want us to be able to move much, much faster with newer technologies such as all of the AI models, all the open-source AI models that you're seeing come to market, really level the playing field for us.

 

And by seeing that technology through the lens of an engineering and design and product organized company versus trying to manage this across different business units, it means we can move much better and much faster.

We do have multiple business units right now.

 

They represent multiple brands, multiple customers.

Obviously, as we've been talking about for some time, we believe our superpower is combining these.

 

And I believe strongly that this model will allow us a lot more flexibility, and also the collaboration that you mentioned.

But the real benefit, I believe, is more of a focus on better technology, and better design, and better products through engineering, design, and product being at the top of the company.

 

And obviously, centralizing sales and really providing a tangible change and shift to how we think about Square's go-to-market completes a lot of the work we've been doing on the product side.

So, I'm really excited about that.

 

In terms of risk, we've tried to mitigate a bunch of the risk by changing -- starting with only the reporting structure.

So, Block before this move, every single business unit was functionally organized.

 

So, what this is effectively doing is just removing that business unit lead structure, appointing a new functional lead and going.

So, most of the company will not notice a change at all, but it means that we can start really focusing on our disciplines, and up-leveling and raising the bar on our talent and execution, again, from that technology and design lens.

 

So, I think we've mitigated the risk.

We're not changing any of our goals.

 

We're not changing our assignments to products and projects that people have.

Over time, as we build confidence around those things, we will evolve our operating model and just how we work together.

 

But right now, this is just a reporting shift, so we can really focus on our disciplines and improve them greatly which will have all the desired outcomes that we want.

So, I think with this move in particular there's very little risk because we're holding ourselves accountable to the goals that we put out before us.

 



Tien-Tsin Huang

Glad to hear it.

 

Thanks.
Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with UBS.

 

Your line is open.



Timothy Chiodo

Great.

 

Thank you for taking the question.

I really want to dig in on the US GPV trends within the seller.

 

So, two factors that have impacted growth in the recent past have been discretionary spend, which you called out earlier, particularly you called out earlier, the 2021 and '22 cohorts.

And also, there's been the weakness in the MKE, which was in the shareholder letter.

 

But looking ahead, you have a combination of easing comps, you have the pre-auth and product work done, you have sales force hiring ahead.

You mentioned reinvestment in marketing, distribution partnerships.

 

Granted, many of these factors are more 2025 or 2026 drivers, but with that in mind, maybe you could touch a little bit around, or expand upon the second half GPV expectations, and then somehow these initiatives would be more supportive for next year?

Thanks a lot.

 



Jack Dorsey

Yeah, I can start with this, and then Amrita can follow up.

 

I think we now have a perfect storm brewing for Square.

We've spent the past few months really focused on organizing the product priorities, simplifying our product approach, making sure that we have a much more cohesive and understandable and intuitive system.

 

We're looking at every single aspect of our offering from onboarding and acquisition to our dashboard where sellers are introduced to new products, to the products themselves, our hardware, how we think about marketing.

Everything has been investigated and evolved, including, as we've been talking, about our orders migration, the platform, unlocking features that bring us to parity and beyond our competitors.

 

And now that we are centralizing sales under Nick, I feel like we have a tangible solution to that.

So all the pieces are now set.

 

I do think the majority of them come together at the -- at closer to the end of this year.

So, the end of summer to the end of the year, and really manifest next year.

 

And I think all these changes compound into something that I'm really excited about, much better foundation for us, and gives us an opportunity to truly compete with our peers in a way that we haven't for years.

So, I'm pretty confident about all the moves.

 

I think we've executed them in the right priority, like, really focusing on onboarding and products first and foremost, so we did that acquisition and retaining our sellers, making sure that we have a rock solid and reliable platform that offers all the features that we see with our peers and then improving our go-to-market including newer initiatives like field sales that our peers have used quite effectively, but with a weaker product in my mind.

So then, we have the strength on all of those, I think we're shaped up for really, really good outcomes going forward.

 



Amrita Ahuja

And, Tim, I'll just add some color as well with respect to GPV trend lines that we're seeing.

 

For the second quarter, GPV was up 8% year-over-year, which is a slight moderation from the 9% year-over-year growth rate that we saw in the first quarter.

And as we look towards the back half of the year, we expect to see stability in that GPV growth rate compared to what we saw in the second quarter as I noted earlier.

 

When you unpack some of what's going on there, it is very consistent trend lines with both what we've called out over the past couple of quarters as well as what we're seeing externally.

We're seeing relatively consistent trends from a churn and customer acquisition standpoint, with more of the moderation coming from same-store growth or GPV per seller, which continue to moderate a bit on a year-over-year basis.

 

And we've seen many other companies note similar softness from a discretionary consumer spend perspective as we look at external data points, showing a dynamic macro backdrop, whether it's slower new business formations or industry-specific data across the verticals that we serve.

Now, with that backdrop, we have still been able to grow the Square business strongly from a gross profit perspective, a 15% growth in the second quarter, and with outsized growth in the areas that we are really strategically inflecting, whether it's our vertical points of sale, which grew 21% on a gross profit basis in the second quarter, or our banking products, which grew 27%, or our international markets, which grew 34%.

 

Each of those areas showing strong product market fit with those customers that we're serving.

And so what we're focused on more than anything at this point, as Jack noted, is what we can control, which is improving GPV growth and ultimately gross profit growth by investing across partnerships, ramping our marketing spend, simplifying our onboarding tools, and launching new products.

 



Timothy Chiodo

Thank you, Jack.

 

Thank you, Amrita.
Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.

 

Your line is open.



Darrin Peller

Hey, guys.

 

Thanks.

Nice job.

 

The -- I want to touch on the incremental distribution partners you called out, like US Foods, and obviously those are clear adds and material -- could be material.

I think you talked about 40% coverage of the restaurant space.

 

If you could just expand on this a little bit more on what the potential is for it, how it could contribute to actual GPV potentially over time?

How does this fit into the roadmap and timeline in your strategy?

 

And then maybe just any other types of partnerships we could expect on the horizon, whether it's domestic or internationally?

It seems like a nice addition.

 



Jack Dorsey

Yeah.

 

So we've -- as I said, we've been reconsidering everything including how we think about partnerships.

We've got a lot of questions about this in the past.

 

We're investing in three types of partners, vertical in specific industries like food and beverage, horizontal that have more broad reach across geographies and business types, and then looking at third-party sales organizations.

In terms of food, as we mentioned in our shareholder letter, we've made a lot of progress, especially around food and beverages and we signed US Foods, and that means we're serving to our partners up to 40% of the restaurants in the United States, which is a pretty sizable chunk.

 

And we have a strong pipeline of both vertical and horizontal partners in the US.

International, we're doing a lot more, especially around bank partnerships.

 

So, outside of the US, the bank partnership angle is working quite well and we're working to sign more.

And also, internationally, we're exploring third-party sales as well.

 

It's just a much easier approach than what we're currently seeing in the US, and where we think we're going to get the most impact in the United States.



Darrin Peller

That's great.

 

Thanks, Jack.



Jack Dorsey

Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research.

 

Your line is open.



Ken Suchoski

Hey, good afternoon.

 

Thanks for taking the question.

Direct deposit has been a focus for the company for some time.

 

I don't think I saw it in the letter, but I think we're still at a few million recurring paycheck direct depositors.

One of your main competitors has, call it, 4 million to 5 million direct depositors.

 

What's it going to take to push this number meaningfully higher?

What's working?

 

What's not working?

And is there any way to think about the adoption curve around direct depositors and the visibility you have into that?

 

Thanks so much.



Jack Dorsey

Yeah, I can start and Amrita can follow up, but there's three main ways that we believe we will drive direct deposit and this is all captured in our bank the base strategy, which we referenced in earlier earnings letter.

 

The first is packaging, the second is around marketing, and the third is products.

I'll start with packaging.

 

We want to make sure that the benefits of depositing your paycheck is super clear in the app.

So, one of the things we're doing is those who deposit $300 each month get access to free overdraft coverage up to a certain amount, 4.5% savings yield, priority phone support, which is really important and free in-network ATM withdrawals, in addition to early access to the paycheck.

 

So, making sure that those incentives are clear.

Marketing is another one.

 

We're investing in the back half of the year as we've been further refining our strategy based on the impact that we're seeing.

Again, like, the incentives matter here.

 

So, we have deep expertise in peer-to-peer referrals and Cash App Card with Boost.

We're starting a test this past quarter and seeing some strong results around our marketing and just like marketing those incentives.

 

And we're cross selling direct deposit through in-app messages as well.

And then finally, in products, we want to add spending insights to the Cash App Card so customers can make more informed financial decisions, improving our web experience to look at balances and review statements.

 

That's what a lot of our customers expect from their bank and they should expect it from Cash App as well.

And then, integrating commerce by expanding buy now, pay later on the Cash App Card later this year.

 

These are all ways that people can make their money work more for them, and reasons why they just want to direct deposit their entire paycheck to cash up that they have much better utility.

So, that's how we think about driving it.

 

And again, it all goes back to the bank the base strategy.

And I'll let Amrita follow up.

 



Amrita Ahuja

Yeah.

 

Ken, I'd just add that we're really holding ourselves accountable to two metrics as we assess our performance against our bank the base strategy, which of course, is just about making Cash App our customers' primary financial tool.

The near-term metric is inflows per active.

 

The medium to longer-term metric is around paycheck deposit actives.

So, looking at each of those with inflows per active, we've had strong momentum on engagement through the first half of this year.

 

In both the first quarter and second quarter, we saw double-digit growth in inflows per active behind strength in our banking products, specifically with Cash App Card and Cash App Borrow.

With card, we saw -- we've seen this product is oftentimes our customers' first entry point into banking with Cash App.

 

And as utility grows, ultimately, we see a greater portion of inflows from those customers.

With Cash App Borrow, this provides customers with access to small dollar credit, kind of like working capital, which is really key we've seen to winning that primary banking relationship.

 

So, continuing to drive engagement and adoption of these key financial services products is ultimately leading to stronger engagement and stronger inflows per active.

On the second metric, paycheck direct deposit active, this is a longer-term strategy, one that we've really clarified throughout the first part of this year, and as Jack noted, have already made a bunch of progress across packaging, marketing, and product features.

 

But that $2 million or so paycheck deposit actives was largely driven organically, and that number has continued to increase quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year as we've increased the penetration of -- into our Cash App Card active base even through the second quarter.

And as you heard from Jack, there's more to come both from a product and go-to-market perspective that we think drives focus not only to our overall banking products, but also ultimately to the long-term goal of earning their paycheck.

 



Ken Suchoski

Great.

 

Thanks so much.
Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.

 

Your line is open.



Jason Kupferberg

Hi, guys.

 

So, lots of balls in the air at Square.

We've gone through a lot of it.

 

I'm curious, as you look ahead to 2025, which of these newer product and go-to-market initiatives are really best positioned ultimately to move the needle on GPV growth, if you had to highlight maybe the top couple or so?



Jack Dorsey

Yeah.

 

I think the most important thing is our platform, and making sure that we have something that's reliable.

We did take a bunch of hits in the past when our service went down.

 

So this is a number one priority when we make sure that we are up for our sellers constantly and we're not taking any time away from their business, and that's not just about our keeping our servers up.

It's also providing features that allows them to work offline, even when their Wi-Fi is down, so they can still make the sale.

 

Orders migration is something we've been talking about.

This is migrating our system to a newer framework so that we can add features like pre-auth and deposits and other things.

 

The kiosk that we just launched, the Square Kiosk is built on this new platform.

So, we do have this up and we will scale it to the rest of our features by the end of this summer.

 

So, all that's on track.

The pre-auth capabilities that are being tested today through bar tabs with select sellers and all this means we can serve a wider range of sellers, more bars, full-service restaurants, service sellers, and omni-channel retailers.

 

Onboarding has been a big focus for us as we mentioned in the shareholder letter.

It took over 10 minutes, in most cases like 20 minutes and 30 steps just to sign up for Square and we got that down to four.

 

And that means that people can see the dashboard right away and they can see the full breadth of everything that we offer, all of our products, and they can start attaching to those products and turning them on.

But most importantly, they get a feel of what Square is and much easier to commit to it after you feel it.

 

And the single app is one thing I'm really excited about.

We have four or five apps in the App Store.

 

We're going to bring that down to one.

That really eases our go-to-market because all we have to say is download Square in the App Store or Google Play, and the app will customize itself based on your preferences, and based on how you use it, and based on your role at the particular business that you're in.

 

So we're using much better technology to personalize our experiences on the apps and through our hardware and through the dashboard itself.

So as I said before, I think we're -- we have a perfect storm.

 

We've been focusing on product and acquisition and retaining folks.

We have a much stronger answer as we centralize sales across the entire company, and we have one go-to-market strategy with a leader who has done some amazing things on the Afterpay side.

 

And all these things will compound into a lot of the outcomes that we've been wanting to see for some time, and I think put us in a lead against a lot of our peers.



Jason Kupferberg

Thank you.

 
Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays.

 

Your line is open.



Ramsey El-Assal

Hi, Jack and Amrita.

 

Thanks a lot for taking my question this evening.

I wanted to follow up on some of your responses around the orders migration and replatforming project.

 

And could you help us think through the incremental sort of market opportunity that it opens for you guys, and maybe also comment on the sales strategy to sell in the new capabilities?

Will you be leveraging inside sales, or cross-sell, or how do you kind of proactively get that to market expeditiously?

 



Jack Dorsey

Yeah…

 



Amrita Ahuja

Go ahead, Jack.

 



Jack Dorsey

I can start on this.

 

I think the most important thing about the orders migration is that we have a much more flexible and reliable platform with which to build on top, and it does unlock a bunch of features that bring us to parity and beyond with our peers, especially in food and beverage.

So as I said before, stuff like pre-auth, and bar tabs, and there's a whole host of features that have been blocked on this work.

 

But ultimately, it's not just about those particular features, it's about a much greater development velocity because we have a much more stable, much more cohesive, and much more enabling platform that allows us to really move a lot faster, but also build better products.

And product has always been our strength, and I would state that our product is far above the majority -- product quality is far above the majority of our competitors.

 

Where we have been weaker in the past is how we mirror that with our go-to-market strategy, and just updating our approach there, especially given what our competitors have done.

Acquisition has been tough because we just put way too many steps in front of sellers.

 

So, all of these are either launched, or about to be launched.

And that gets us back to a Square that I think becomes a leader for sellers again in a way that we haven't seen in quite some time.

 



Amrita Ahuja

Yeah, Ramsey, I can add just a bit of color maybe to help bring it to life a little bit what the -- how important the orders migration is for us.

 

Ultimately, the orders migration moves us from a payment-oriented platform towards a sales-oriented platform.

Almost all of our products assume a single payment was at the heart of a sale, but as we know, commerce has grown far more complex than that.

 

Just to give you a couple of examples, if you order online and pick up in store, the order and the payment might be separate events.

If you go to a full-service restaurant and place an order, the order and payment again may be separate events.

 

If a customer buys five items from an e-commerce seller and wants to return to, you need to have separate logic for the card between the order and the payment for each item.

Final example, if you're a services seller that needs a deposit before starting a project, that project or order is the core of your business, and enables -- once we shift to the orders migration, enables multiple payments for that project.

 

So what it enables our sellers to do is be able to sell more anywhere, anyhow more flexibly, help them run more efficiently, give them time back and empower them with the data to better serve their customers.

It unlocked just most recently our kiosk product launch, which is something that we know is really important again for the food and beverage space where sellers that want to sell via kiosk, drive through the other forms of checkout, need to open and order, which exists throughout the sale and in many cases exist long after the buyer has consumed the goods or services.

 

So, those are just some examples of the sorts of things across really all verticals, food and beverage, services, retail, that our orders migration helps unlock.



Ramsey El-Assal

Thank you very much.

And your next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein.

 

Your line is open.



Harshita Rawat

Hi, good afternoon.

 

Can you give us some more color on the Core Scientific deal?

How do you think about the opportunity within Bitcoin mining hardware?

 

Thank you.



Jack Dorsey

Yeah, happy to.

 

This is a -- I think this is a massive opportunity for us.

That -- this is a super concentrated industry with one main provider and that is Bitmain.

 

We spent a lot of time talking to Bitmain's customers.

All the feedback was extremely consistent.

 

The number one concern is reliability.

Bitmain produces mining chips and rigs that fail a lot.

 

The second was around being able to customize into miner's particular solutions.

This is why we decided to make the chip, and also build this in the open source -- in an open-source way, so that our customers can actually design their systems around any part of our system that they wish, or can buy a full mining rig from us.

 

And then second -- or sorry, third is being just a lot more transparent around pricing.

And all three of those things are what mattered most to miners and our customers.

 

In addition, we're one of the few companies in the world that have access to a 3-nanometer fab.

Bitmain is producing chips that are 6-nanometer.

 

So, we can build a far better product, that's far more reliable, far more open, and configurable.

And this is super attractive to every single miner that we've talked to, and you're seeing the results of that within one of the deals we just announced, and we have a very strong pipeline behind it as well.

 

So, I'm fully confident and have no doubt that this is going to be a significant business for us, and we're going to take a majority of the market share.



Harshita Rawat

And your next question comes from the line of Lafitani Sotiriou with MST.

 

Your line is open.



Lafitani Sotiriou

Hi, everyone.

 

Great to see the up to $3 billion reload of the share repurchase program.

Can you talk to the capital intensity of Cash App and Square?

 

And is it changing as the product mix shifts?



Amrita Ahuja

Thanks for the question.

 

So first, just with respect to capital allocation, to provide context level-set, as we progress towards being a Rule of 40 company, we expect both our margin profile to improve, as well as our free cash flow generation.

And what we expect to do with -- as you see here with our $3 billion share repurchase authorization as a continuation of our initial $1 billion share repurchase authorization last year is to return capital to shareholders in excess of what we need to run our business.

 

What we need to run our business, which I think is sort of the core to your question is, obviously, to support our operating expenses, where you've seen a tremendous amount of leverage from us over the past year or two across personnel, across corporate overhead, expenses across our structural unit economics in each of our businesses.

And we expect to continue that work as you see reflected in our raised profitability guide that not only reflects the strong second quarter, but also our improved expectations for the back half of the year.

 

So we continue to -- on that journey of driving efficiency and discipline in our operating expenses.

The second piece of, obviously, what our balance sheet covers from a business operations standpoint is some of the lending originations related to our core lending products, which include, obviously, Square Loans where we sell the vast majority of those loans off to investors, our Afterpay buy now, pay later product, and our Cash App Borrow product.

 

Both of those two products are typically very small in size, $100 to $200 type loans on average, and turn 15 times a year with very simplified repayment mechanism.

So, given the short duration, given the small size, they really act like working capital for our customers, and we can efficiently turn a dollar on our balance sheet to support the growth of each of those -- the strong growth that we're seeing in each of those businesses.

 

We also, as we think longer term, have optionality around our funding structures.

As we've done with Square Loans, we have the potential to expand upon our investor base that we could potentially bring buy now, pay later and Borrow to, over the medium to long term.

 

And really our focus is on the very strong unit economics and risk-return profiles that we've seen with both of these products to continue to make that case to investors over the long term.



Lafitani Sotiriou

So, can I summarize the capital intensity is broadly the same and we should expect to see ongoing share repurchase programs over time as the profitability improves as you move to Rule of 40?

 



Amrita Ahuja

Yeah.

 

Our capital allocation program is, as I said, first and foremost, support the organic growth of the business, and to ensure that we can also support a diverse balance sheet, including some of these lending originations, some which we may sell off, and then to return excess capital to shareholders, and that's what you see today with $3 billion purchase authorization.

And your next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho.

 

Your line is open.



Dan Dolev

Hi, Amrita and Jack.

 

Thank you for taking my question this evening.

Great results.

 

I wanted to ask about Cash App Pay.

It looks like it continues to grow.

 

I think you mentioned volumes up seven times year-over-year, 18% quarter-over-quarter.

This seems like a huge opportunity.

 

Can you maybe talk a little bit about the drivers and what to expect in the coming six to 12 months from that?

Thank you.

 



Jack Dorsey

Yeah, you're right.

 

The volume was up more than 7X compared to the prior year, and 18% quarter-over-quarter.

What's driving the growth is our sales team, Afterpay's enterprise sales team.

 

As of June, Cash App Pay actives were more than 80% of the scale of Afterpay US actives compared to less than 25% a year ago.

We're signing many large merchants.

 

This past quarter, we added Google Play, which is a top merchant for Cash App Card, and we're finding that merchants value Cash App Pay because they can access all Cash App customers, our Cash App Pay actives are highly engaged and we offer competitive pricing.

So the formula is working and the sales team is doing an amazing job and we'll continue to grow.

 



Dan Dolev

Great.

And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.

 

Your line is open.



Bryan Keane

Hi, thanks for taking the question.

 

Can you help us understand the pricing opportunities inside of the Square seller, especially with some of the product acceleration refreshes, thinking just about pricing higher for value versus some of the pricing transparency, and potentially coming in at a lower cost of ownership that you mentioned in the shareholder letter for some of the incumbents and digital peers?

Thanks.

 



Jack Dorsey

Yeah.

 

I think at a very high level, we have a lot of opportunity here.

We're seeing a lot of our peers and competitors raise their pricing, and that doesn't necessarily come with a raise in quality or more products or more features.

 

So, we've been spending a lot of time on our quality and our products and features.

We've also been looking at simplifying how we approach pricing, and how it's presented to our customers, and we're right in the midst of doing a bunch of those reviews, and looking at the numbers and how those might work, I do think like we can have a better packaging and better bundling of our products, and we're doing that work right now.

 

And I'm pretty excited about starting to test these things, and that will be something that we will do definitely this year.

But I think we have a -- an amazing opportunity just given what our peers are doing as well, and how we're seeing them raise our pricing and opportunity for us to take a larger portion of the network, and not have our pricing be an excuse.

 

We can take that off the table.

But I think the majority of it's going to come from really looking at simplifying and getting people in as soon as possible so they can see the full extent of our ecosystem and the value that it brings with the -- with much simpler pricing going forward.

 



Bryan Keane

Got it.

And we will now take our last question from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs.

 

Your line is open.



Will Nance

Hey, I appreciate you squeezing me in here.

 

I wanted to ask a question on the Cash App monthly active this quarter.

I think there was a comment in the shareholder letter about some enhancements made to promote a healthier ecosystem, as well as a strategic pullback in marketing spend.

 

So, maybe you could kind of elaborate on what's driving those, and maybe specifically on some of the enhancements that you made?

Appreciate it.

 

And thanks for taking the question.



Amrita Ahuja

Sure.

 

Thanks, Will.

So, in June, we ended the quarter with 57 million monthly actives in Cash App, which was a growth of 5% year-over-year, similar to the growth rate that we saw earlier in the year as well.

 

We see a really compelling opportunity here to drive actives on growth for consumers in the US with less than $150,000 in household income.

That represents 80% of the US today.

 

And so, there's significant opportunity to continue to gain market share.

Some of the enhancements that we called out specifically in the shareholder letter are really to drive our continued focus on promoting a healthy ecosystem.

 

So, it includes changes to the onboarding flow, which can, among other things, give us a better understanding of our customers, enable access to more products, and higher limits for those customers, and also helps create opportunities for cross-selling.

We're continuing to see strong engagement as we make some of these changes.

 

We really have focused on driving deeper engagement across our financial services and commerce products for our customers, and you see that evidenced by the strong growth of inflows per active, which grew, as I noted earlier, 10% year-over-year.

From a marketing perspective, we've been fairly disciplined in marketing as we refined our bank the base strategy in the first half of the year, and we're now ready and planning to ramp spend in the back half of the year on various campaigns.

 

And you heard about some of those earlier as we talked about our bank the base strategy, or engaging our customers in our banking products, and ultimately earning their paycheck.

As we think about the opportunity ahead, we see significant opportunity to continue to grow across our base of potential customers in the United States.

 

We know Cash App resonates strongly with Gen Z and millennials.

Those customers, those demographics, make up nearly 75% of our active base, and we think there's plenty of room to grow because we estimate we're only 34% penetrated in the Gen Z segment and 25% penetrated in the millennial segment.

 

So as we look at the long term, we see an opportunity to continue to grow our active potential base of customers for Cash App.
